His death\r\nwas partly due to the great exertions imposed upon him by the stress of\r\npolice work during the war troubles and the battle of Leipzig, and\r\npartly to the fact that he fell a victim to the nervous fever which was\r\nraging at that time. As regards his father’s position in life, I learnt\r\nlater that he had held a small civil appointment as toll collector at\r\nthe Ranstädt Gate, but had distinguished himself from those in the same\r\nstation by giving his two sons a superior education, my father,\r\nFriedrich, studying law, and the younger son, Adolph, theology.\r\n\r\nMy uncle subsequently exercised no small influence on my development;\r\nwe shall meet him again at a critical turning-point in the story of my\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nMy father, whom I had lost so early, was, as I discovered afterwards, a\r\ngreat lover of poetry and literature in general, and possessed in\r\nparticular an almost passionate affection for the drama, which was at\r\nthat time much in vogue among the educated classes. My mother told me,\r\namong other things, that he took her to Lauchstadt for the first\r\nperformance of the _Braut von Messina_, and that on the promenade he\r\npointed out Schiller and Goethe to her, and reproved her warmly for\r\nnever having heard of these great men. He is said to have been not\r\naltogether free from a gallant interest in actresses. My mother used to\r\ncomplain jokingly that she often had to keep lunch waiting for him\r\nwhile he was paying court to a certain famous actress of the day.[1]\r\nWhen she scolded him, he vowed that he had been delayed by papers that\r\nhad to be attended to, and as a proof of his assertion pointed to his\r\nfingers, which were supposed to be stained with ink, but on closer\r\ninspection were found to be quite clean. His great fondness for the\r\ntheatre was further shown by his choice of the actor, Ludwig Geyer, as\r\none of his intimate friends. Although his choice of this friend was no\r\ndoubt mainly due to his love for the theatre, he at the same time\r\nintroduced into his family the noblest of benefactors; for this modest\r\nartist, prompted by a warm interest in the lot of his friend’s large\r\nfamily, so unexpectedly left destitute, devoted the remainder of his\r\nlife to making strenuous efforts to maintain and educate the orphans.\r\nEven when the police official was spending his evenings at the theatre,\r\nthe worthy actor generally filled his place in the family circle, and\r\nit seems had frequently to appease my mother, who, rightly or wrongly,\r\ncomplained of the frivolity of her husband.\r\n\r\n [1] Madame Hartwig.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow deeply the homeless artist, hard pressed by life and tossed to and\r\nfro, longed to feel himself at home in a sympathetic family circle, was\r\nproved by the fact that a year after his friend’s death he married his\r\nwidow, and from that time forward became a most loving father to the\r\nseven children that had been left behind.\r\n\r\nIn this onerous undertaking he was favoured by an unexpected\r\nimprovement in his position, for he obtained a remunerative,\r\nrespectable, and permanent engagement, as a character actor, at the\r\nnewly established Court Theatre in Dresden. His talent for painting,\r\nwhich had already helped him to earn a livelihood when forced by\r\nextreme poverty to break off his university studies, again stood him in\r\ngood stead in his position at Dresden. True, he complained even more\r\nthan his critics that he had been kept from a regular and systematic\r\nstudy of this art, yet his extraordinary aptitude, for portrait\r\npainting in particular, secured him such important commissions that he\r\nunfortunately exhausted his strength prematurely by his twofold\r\nexertions as painter and actor. Once, when he was invited to Munich to\r\nfulfil a temporary engagement at the Court Theatre, he received,\r\nthrough the distinguished recommendation of the Saxon Court, such\r\npressing commissions from the Bavarian Court for portraits of the royal\r\nfamily that he thought it wise to cancel his contract altogether. He\r\nalso had a turn for poetry. Besides fragments—often in very dainty\r\nverse—he wrote several comedies, one of which, _Der Bethlehemitische\r\nKindermord_, in rhymed Alexandrines, was often performed; it was\r\npublished and received the warmest praise from Goethe.\r\n\r\nThis excellent man, under whose care our family moved to Dresden when I\r\nwas two years old, and by whom my mother had another daughter, Cecilia,\r\nnow also took my education in hand with the greatest care and\r\naffection. He wished to adopt me altogether, and accordingly, when I\r\nwas sent to my first school, he gave me his own name, so that till the\r\nage of fourteen I was known to my Dresden schoolfellows as Richard\r\nGeyer; and it was not until some years after my stepfather’s death, and\r\non my family’s return to Leipzig, the home of my own kith and kin, that\r\nI resumed the name of Wagner.\r\n\r\nThe earliest recollections of my childhood are associated with my\r\nstepfather, and passed from him to the theatre. I well remember that he\r\nwould have liked to see me develop a talent for painting; and his\r\nstudio, with the easel and the pictures upon it, did not fail to\r\nimpress me. I remember in particular that I tried, with a childish love\r\nof imitation, to copy a portrait of King Frederick Augustus of Saxony;\r\nbut when this simple daubing had to give place to a serious study of\r\ndrawing, I could not stand it, possibly because I was discouraged by\r\nthe pedantic technique of my teacher, a cousin of mine, who was rather\r\na bore. At one time during my early boyhood I became so weak after some\r\nchildish ailment that my mother told me later she used almost to wish\r\nme dead, for it seemed as though I should never get well. However, my\r\nsubsequent good health apparently astonished my parents. I afterwards\r\nlearnt the noble part played by my excellent stepfather on this\r\noccasion also; he never gave way to despair, in spite of the cares and\r\ntroubles of so large a family, but remained patient throughout, and\r\nnever lost the hope of pulling me through safely.\r\n\r\nMy imagination at this time was deeply impressed by my acquaintance\r\nwith the theatre, with which I was brought into contact, not only as a\r\nchildish spectator from the mysterious stagebox, with its access to the\r\nstage, and by visits to the wardrobe with its fantastic costumes, wigs\r\nand other disguises, but also by taking a part in the performances\r\nmyself. After I had been filled with fear by seeing my father play the\r\nvillain’s part in such tragedies as _Die Waise und der Mörder, Die\r\nbeiden Galeerensklaven_, I occasionally took part in comedy. I remember\r\nthat I appeared in _Der Weinberg an der Elbe_, a piece specially\r\nwritten to welcome the King of Saxony on his return from captivity,\r\nwith music by the conductor, C. M. von Weber. In this I figured in a\r\n_tableau vivant_ as an angel, sewn up in tights with wings on my back,\r\nin a graceful pose which I had laboriously practised. I also remember\r\non this occasion being given a big iced cake, which I was assured the\r\nKing had intended for me personally. Lastly, I can recall taking a\r\nchild’s part in which I had a few words to speak in Kotzebue’s\r\n_Menschenhass und Reue_[2], which furnished me with an excuse at school\r\nfor not having learnt my lessons. I said I had too much to do, as I had\r\nto learn by heart an important part in _Den Menschen ausser der\r\nReihe_.[3]\r\n\r\n [2] ‘Misanthropy and Remorse.’\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] ‘The Man out of the Rank or Row.’ In the German this is a simple\r\n phonetic corruption of Kotzebue’s title, which might easily occur to a\r\n child who had only heard, and not read, that title.—EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to show how seriously my father regarded my\r\neducation, when I was six years old he took me to a clergyman in the\r\ncountry at Possendorf, near Dresden, where I was to be given a sound\r\nand healthy training with other boys of my own class. In the evening,\r\nthe vicar, whose name was Wetzel, used to tell us the story of Robinson\r\nCrusoe, and discuss it with us in a highly instructive manner. I was,\r\nmoreover, much impressed by a biography of Mozart which was read aloud;\r\nand the newspaper accounts and monthly reports of the events of the\r\nGreek War of Independence stirred my imagination deeply. My love for\r\nGreece, which afterwards made me turn with enthusiasm to the mythology\r\nand history of ancient Hellas, was thus the natural outcome of the\r\nintense and painful interest I took in the events of this period. In\r\nafter years the story of the struggle of the Greeks against the\r\nPersians always revived my impressions of this modern revolt of Greece\r\nagainst the Turks.\r\n\r\nOne day, when I had been in this country home scarcely a year, a\r\nmessenger came from town to ask the vicar to take me to my parents’\r\nhouse in Dresden, as my father was dying.\r\n\r\nWe did the three hours’ journey on foot; and as I was very exhausted\r\nwhen I arrived, I scarcely understood why my mother was crying. The\r\nnext day I was taken to my father’s bedside; the extreme weakness with\r\nwhich he spoke to me, combined with all the precautions taken in the\r\nlast desperate treatment of his complaint—acute hydrothorax—made the\r\nwhole scene appear like a dream to me, and I think I was too frightened\r\nand surprised to cry.\r\n\r\nIn the next room my mother asked me to show her what I could play on\r\nthe piano, wisely hoping to divert my father’s thoughts by the sound. I\r\nplayed Ueb’ immer Treu und Redlichkeit, and my father said to her, ‘Is\r\nit possible he has musical talent?’\r\n\r\nIn the early hours of the next morning my mother came into the great\r\nnight nursery, and, standing by the bedside of each of us in turn, told\r\nus, with sobs, that our father was dead, and gave us each a message\r\nwith his blessing. To me she said, ‘He hoped to make something of you.’\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon my schoolmaster, Wetzel, came to take me back to the\r\ncountry. We walked the whole way to Possendorf, arriving at nightfall.\r\nOn the way I asked him many questions about the stars, of which he gave\r\nme my first intelligent idea.\r\n\r\nA week later my stepfather’s brother arrived from Eisleben for the\r\nfuneral. He promised, as far as he was able, to support the family,\r\nwhich was now once more destitute, and undertook to provide for my\r\nfuture education.\r\n\r\nI took leave of my companions and of the kind-hearted clergyman, and it\r\nwas for his funeral that I paid my next visit to Possendorf a few years\r\nlater. I did not go to the place again till long afterwards, when I\r\nvisited it on an excursion such as I often made, far into the country,\r\nat the time when I was conducting the orchestra in Dresden. I was much\r\ngrieved not to find the old parsonage still there, but in its place a\r\nmore pretentious modern structure, which so turned me against the\r\nlocality, that thenceforward my excursions were always made in another\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThis time my uncle brought me back to Dresden in the carriage. I found\r\nmy mother and sister in the deepest mourning, and remember being\r\nreceived for the first time with a tenderness not usual in our family;\r\nand I noticed that the same tenderness marked our leave-taking, when, a\r\nfew days later, my uncle took me with him to Eisleben.\r\n\r\nThis uncle, who was a younger brother of my stepfather, had settled\r\nthere as a goldsmith, and Julius, one of my elder brothers, had already\r\nbeen apprenticed to him. Our old grandmother also lived with this\r\nbachelor son, and as it was evident that she could not live long, she\r\nwas not informed of the death of her eldest son, which I, too, was\r\nbidden to keep to myself. The servant carefully removed the crape from\r\nmy coat, telling me she would keep it until my grandmother died, which\r\nwas likely to be soon.\r\n\r\nI was now often called upon to tell her about my father, and it was no\r\ngreat difficulty for me to keep the secret of his death, as I had\r\nscarcely realised it myself. She lived in a dark back room looking out\r\nupon a narrow courtyard, and took a great delight in watching the\r\nrobins that fluttered freely about her, and for which she always kept\r\nfresh green boughs by the stove. When some of these robins were killed\r\nby the cat, I managed to catch others for her in the neighbourhood,\r\nwhich pleased her very much, and, in return, she kept me tidy and\r\nclean. Her death, as had been expected, took place before long, and the\r\ncrape that had been put away was now openly worn in Eisleben.\r\n\r\nThe back room, with its robins and green branches, now knew me no more,\r\nbut I soon made myself at home with a soap-boiler’s family, to whom the\r\nhouse belonged, and became popular with them on account of the stories\r\nI told them.\r\n\r\nI was sent to a private school kept by a man called Weiss, who left an\r\nimpression of gravity and dignity upon my mind.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fifties I was greatly moved at reading in a\r\nmusical paper the account of a concert at Eisleben, consisting of parts\r\nof Tannhäuser, at which my former master, who had not forgotten his\r\nyoung pupil, had been present.\r\n\r\nThe little old town with Luther’s house, and the numberless memorials\r\nit contained of his stay there, has often, in later days, come back to\r\nme in dreams. I have always wished to revisit it and verify the\r\nclearness of my recollections, but, strange to say, it has never been\r\nmy fate to do so. We lived in the market-place, where I was often\r\nentertained by strange sights, such, for instance, as performances by a\r\ntroupe of acrobats, in which a man walked a rope stretched from tower\r\nto tower across the square, an achievement which long inspired me with\r\na passion for such feats of daring. Indeed, I got so far as to walk a\r\nrope fairly easily myself with the help of a balancing-pole. I had made\r\nthe rope out of cords twisted together and stretched across the\r\ncourtyard, and even now I still feel a desire to gratify my acrobatic\r\ninstincts. The thing that attracted me most, however, was the brass\r\nband of a Hussar regiment quartered at Eisleben. It often played a\r\ncertain piece which had just come out, and which was making a great\r\nsensation, I mean the ‘Huntsmen’s Chorus’ out of the Freischutz, that\r\nhad been recently performed at the Opera in Berlin. My uncle and\r\nbrother asked me eagerly about its composer, Weber, whom I must have\r\nseen at my parents’ house in Dresden, when he was conductor of the\r\norchestra there.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Jungfernkranz was zealously played and sung by\r\nsome friends who lived near us. These two pieces cured me of my\r\nweakness for the ‘Ypsilanti’ Waltz, which till that time I had regarded\r\nas the most wonderful of compositions.\r\n\r\nI have recollections of frequent tussles with the town boys, who were\r\nconstantly mocking at me for my ‘square’ cap; and I remember, too, that\r\nI was very fond of rambles of adventure among the rocky banks of the\r\nUnstrut.\r\n\r\nMy uncle’s marriage late in life, and the starting of his new home,\r\nbrought about a marked alteration in his relations to my family.\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of a year I was taken by him to Leipzig, and handed over\r\nfor some days to the Wagners, my own father’s relatives, consisting of\r\nmy uncle Adolph and his sister Friederike Wagner. This extraordinarily\r\ninteresting man, whose influence afterwards became ever more\r\nstimulating to me, now for the first time brought himself and his\r\nsingular environment into my life.\r\n\r\nHe and my aunt were very close friends of Jeannette Thome, a queer old\r\nmaid who shared with them a large house in the market-place, in which,\r\nif I am not mistaken, the Electoral family of Saxony had, ever since\r\nthe days of Augustus the Strong, hired and furnished the two principal\r\nstoreys for their own use whenever they were in Leipzig.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, Jeannette Thome really owned the second storey, of\r\nwhich she inhabited only a modest apartment looking out on the\r\ncourtyard. As, however, the King merely occupied the hired rooms for a\r\nfew days in the year, Jeannette and her circle generally made use of\r\nhis splendid apartments, and one of these staterooms was made into a\r\nbedroom for me.\r\n\r\nThe decorations and fittings of these rooms also dated from the days of\r\nAugustus the Strong. They were luxurious with heavy silk and rich\r\nrococo furniture, all of which were much soiled with age. As a matter\r\nof fact, I was delighted by these large strange rooms, looking out upon\r\nthe bustling Leipzig market-place, where I loved above all to watch the\r\nstudents in the crowd making their way along in their old-fashioned\r\n‘Club’ attire, and filling up the whole width of the street.\r\n\r\nThere was only one portion of the decorations of the rooms that I\r\nthoroughly disliked, and this consisted of the various portraits, but\r\nparticularly those of high-born dames in hooped petticoats, with\r\nyouthful faces and powdered hair. These appeared to me exactly like\r\nghosts, who, when I was alone in the room, seemed to come back to life,\r\nand filled me with the most abject fear. To sleep alone in this distant\r\nchamber, in that old-fashioned bed of state, beneath those unearthly\r\npictures, was a constant terror to me. It is true I tried to hide my\r\nfear from my aunt when she lighted me to bed in the evening with her\r\ncandle, but never a night passed in which I was not a prey to the most\r\nhorrible ghostly visions, my dread of which would leave me in a bath of\r\nperspiration.\r\n\r\nThe personality of the three chief occupants of this storey was\r\nadmirably adapted to materialise the ghostly impressions of the house\r\ninto a reality that resembled some strange fairy-tale.\r\n\r\nJeannette Thome was very small and stout; she wore a fair Titus wig,\r\nand seemed to hug to herself the consciousness of vanished beauty. My\r\naunt, her faithful friend and guardian, who was also an old maid, was\r\nremarkable for the height and extreme leanness of her person. The\r\noddity of her otherwise very pleasant face was increased by an\r\nexceedingly pointed chin.\r\n\r\nMy uncle Adolph had chosen as his permanent study a dark room in the\r\ncourtyard. There it was that I saw him for the first time, surrounded\r\nby a great wilderness of books, and attired in an unpretentious indoor\r\ncostume, the most striking feature of which was a tall, pointed felt\r\ncap, such as I had seen worn by the clown who belonged to the troupe of\r\nrope-dancers at Eisleben. A great love of independence had driven him\r\nto this strange retreat. He had been originally destined for the\r\nChurch, but he soon gave that up, in order to devote himself entirely\r\nto philological studies. But as he had the greatest dislike of acting\r\nas a professor and teacher in a regular post, he soon tried to make a\r\nmeagre livelihood by literary work. He had certain social gifts, and\r\nespecially a fine tenor voice, and appears in his youth to have been\r\nwelcome as a man of letters among a fairly wide circle of friends at\r\nLeipzig.\r\n\r\nOn a trip to Jena, during which he and a companion seem to have found\r\ntheir way into various musical and oratorical associations, he paid a\r\nvisit to Schiller. With this object in view, he had come armed with a\r\nrequest from the management of the Leipzig Theatre, who wanted to\r\nsecure the rights of Wallenstein, which was just finished. He told me\r\nlater of the magic impression made upon him by Schiller, with his tall\r\nslight figure and irresistibly attractive blue eyes. His only complaint\r\nwas that, owing to a well-meant trick played on him by his friend, he\r\nhad been placed in a most trying position; for the latter had managed\r\nto send Schiller a small volume of Adolph Wagner’s poems in advance.\r\n\r\nThe young poet was much embarrassed to hear Schiller address him in\r\nflattering terms on the subject of his poetry, but was convinced that\r\nthe great man was merely encouraging him out of kindness. Afterwards he\r\ndevoted himself entirely to philological studios—one of his best-known\r\npublications in that department being his Parnasso Italiano, which he\r\ndedicated to Goethe in an Italian poem. True, I have heard experts say\r\nthat the latter was written in unusually pompous Italian; but Goethe\r\nsent him a letter full of praise, as well as a silver cup from his own\r\nhousehold plate. The impression that I, as a boy of eight, conceived of\r\nAdolph Wagner, amid the surroundings of his own home, was that he was a\r\npeculiarly puzzling character.\r\n\r\nI soon had to leave the influence of this environment and was brought\r\nback to my people at Dresden. Meanwhile my family, under the guidance\r\nof my bereaved mother, had been obliged to settle down as well as they\r\ncould under the circumstances. My eldest brother Albert, who originally\r\nintended to study medicine, had, upon the advice of Weber, who had much\r\nadmired his beautiful tenor voice, started his theatrical career in\r\nBreslau. My second sister Louisa soon followed his example, and became\r\nan actress. My eldest sister Rosalie had obtained an excellent\r\nengagement at the Dresden Court Theatre, and the younger members of the\r\nfamily all looked up to her; for she was now the main support of our\r\npoor sorrowing mother. My family still occupied the same comfortable\r\nhome which my father had made for them. Some of the spare rooms were\r\noccasionally let to strangers, and Spohr was among those who at one\r\ntime lodged with us. Thanks to her great energy, and to help received\r\nfrom various sources (among which the continued generosity of the\r\nCourt, out of respect to the memory of my late stepfather, must not be\r\nforgotten), my mother managed so well in making both ends meet, that\r\neven my education did not suffer.\r\n\r\nAfter it had been decided that my sister Clara, owing to her\r\nexceedingly beautiful voice, should also go on the stage, my mother\r\ntook the greatest care to prevent me from developing any taste whatever\r\nfor the theatre. She never ceased to reproach herself for having\r\nconsented to the theatrical career of my eldest brother, and as my\r\nsecond brother showed no greater talents than those which were useful\r\nto him as a goldsmith, it was now her chief desire to see some progress\r\nmade towards the fulfilment of the hopes and wishes of my step-father,\r\n‘who hoped to make something of me.’ On the completion of my eighth\r\nyear I was sent to the Kreuz Grammar School in Dresden, where it was\r\nhoped I would study! There I was placed at the bottom of the lowest\r\nclass, and started my education under the most unassuming auspices.\r\n\r\nMy mother noted with much interest the slightest signs I might show of\r\na growing love and ability for my work. She herself, though not highly\r\neducated, always created a lasting impression on all who really learnt\r\nto know her, and displayed a peculiar combination of practical domestic\r\nefficiency and keen intellectual animation. She never gave one of her\r\nchildren any definite information concerning her antecedents. She came\r\nfrom Weissenfels, and admitted that her parents had been bakers[4]\r\nthere. Even in regard to her maiden name she always spoke with some\r\nembarrassment, and intimated that it was ‘Perthes,’ though, as we\r\nafterwards ascertained, it was in reality ‘Bertz.’ Strange to say, she\r\nhad been placed in a high-class boarding-school in Leipzig, where she\r\nhad enjoyed the advantage of the care and interest of one of ‘her\r\nfather’s influential friends,’ to whom she afterwards referred as being\r\na Weimar prince who had been very kind to her family in Weissenfels.\r\nHer education in that establishment seems to have been interrupted on\r\naccount of the sudden death of this ‘friend.’ She became acquainted\r\nwith my father at a very early age, and married him in the first bloom\r\nof her youth, he also being very young, though he already held an\r\nappointment. Her chief characteristics seem to have been a keen sense\r\nof humour and an amiable temper, so we need not suppose that it was\r\nmerely a sense of duty towards the family of a departed comrade that\r\nafterwards induced the admirable Ludwig Geyer to enter into matrimony\r\nwith her when she was no longer youthful, but rather that he was\r\nimpelled to that step by a sincere and warm regard for the widow of his\r\nfriend. A portrait of her, painted by Geyer during the lifetime of my\r\nfather, gives one a very favourable impression of what she must have\r\nbeen. Even from the time when my recollection of her is quite distinct,\r\nshe always had to wear a cap owing to some slight affection of the\r\nhead, so that I have no recollection of her as a young and pretty\r\nmother. Her trying position at the head of a numerous family (of which\r\nI was the seventh surviving member), the difficulty of obtaining the\r\nwherewithal to rear them, and of keeping up appearances on very limited\r\nresources, did not conduce to evolve that tender sweetness and\r\nsolicitude which are usually associated with motherhood. I hardly ever\r\nrecollect her having fondled me. Indeed, demonstrations of affection\r\nwere not common in our family, although a certain impetuous, almost\r\npassionate and boisterous manner always characterised our dealings.\r\nThis being so, it naturally seemed to me quite a great event when one\r\nnight I, fretful with sleepiness, looked up at her with tearful eyes as\r\nshe was taking me to bed, and saw her gaze back at me proudly and\r\nfondly, and speak of me to a visitor then present with a certain amount\r\nof tenderness.\r\n\r\n [4] According to more recent information—mill owners.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat struck me more particularly about her was the strange enthusiasm\r\nand almost pathetic manner with which she spoke of the great and of the\r\nbeautiful in Art. Under this heading, however, she would never have let\r\nme suppose that she included dramatic art, but only Poetry, Music, and\r\nPainting. Consequently, she often even threatened me with her curse\r\nshould I ever express a desire to go on the stage. Moreover, she was\r\nvery religiously inclined. With intense fervour she would often give us\r\nlong sermons about God and the divine quality in man, during which, now\r\nand again, suddenly lowering her voice in a rather funny way, she would\r\ninterrupt herself in order to rebuke one of us. After the death of our\r\nstepfather she used to assemble us all round her bed every morning,\r\nwhen one of us would read out a hymn or a part of the Church service\r\nfrom the prayer-book before she took her coffee. Sometimes the choice\r\nof the part to be read was hardly appropriate, as, for instance, when\r\nmy sister Clara on one occasion thoughtlessly read the ‘Prayer to be\r\nsaid in time of War,’ and delivered it with so much expression that my\r\nmother interrupted her, saying: ‘Oh, stop! Good gracious me! Things are\r\nnot quite so bad as that. There’s no war on at present!’\r\n\r\nIn spite of our limited means we had lively and—as they appeared to my\r\nboyish imagination—even brilliant evening parties sometimes. After the\r\ndeath of my stepfather, who, thanks to his success as a portrait\r\npainter, in the later years of his life had raised his income to what\r\nfor those days was a really decent total, many agreeable acquaintances\r\nof very good social position whom he had made during this flourishing\r\nperiod still remained on friendly terms with us, and would occasionally\r\njoin us at our evening gatherings. Amongst those who came were the\r\nmembers of the Court Theatre, who at that time gave very charming and\r\nhighly entertaining parties of their own, which, on my return to\r\nDresden later on, I found had been altogether given up.\r\n\r\nVery delightful, too, were the picnics arranged between us and our\r\nfriends at some of the beautiful spots around Dresden, for these\r\nexcursions were always brightened by a certain artistic spirit and\r\ngeneral good cheer. I remember one such outing we arranged to\r\nLoschwitz, where we made a kind of gypsy camp, in which Carl Maria von\r\nWeber played his part in the character of cook. At home we also had\r\nsome music. My sister Rosalie played the piano, and Clara was beginning\r\nto sing. Of the various theatrical performances we organised in those\r\nearly days, often after elaborate preparation, with the view of amusing\r\nourselves on the birthdays of our elders, I can hardly remember one,\r\nsave a parody on the romantic play of Sappho, by Grillparzer, in which\r\nI took part as one of the singers in the crowd that preceded Phaon’s\r\ntriumphal car. I endeavoured to revive these memories by means of a\r\nfine puppet show, which I found among the effects of my late\r\nstepfather, and for which he himself had painted some beautiful\r\nscenery. It was my intention to surprise my people by means of a\r\nbrilliant performance on this little stage. After I had very clumsily\r\nmade several puppets, and had provided them with a scanty wardrobe made\r\nfrom cuttings of material purloined from my sisters, I started to\r\ncompose a chivalric drama, in which I proposed to rehearse my puppets.\r\nWhen I had drafted the first scene, my sisters happened to discover the\r\nMS. and literally laughed it to scorn, and, to my great annoyance, for\r\na long time afterwards they chaffed me by repeating one particular\r\nsentence which I had put into the mouth of the heroine, and which\r\nwas—Ich hore schon den Ritter trapsen (‘I hear his knightly footsteps\r\nfalling’). I now returned with renewed ardour to the theatre, with\r\nwhich, even at this time, my family was in close touch. Den Freischutz\r\nin particular appealed very strongly to my imagination, mainly on\r\naccount of its ghostly theme. The emotions of terror and the dread of\r\nghosts formed quite an important factor in the development of my mind.\r\nFrom my earliest childhood certain mysterious and uncanny things\r\nexercised an enormous influence over me. If I were left alone in a room\r\nfor long, I remember that, when gazing at lifeless objects such as\r\npieces of furniture, and concentrating my attention upon them, I would\r\nsuddenly shriek out with fright, because they seemed to me alive. Even\r\nduring the latest years of my boyhood, not a night passed without my\r\nwaking out of some ghostly dream and uttering the most frightful\r\nshrieks, which subsided only at the sound of some human voice. The most\r\nsevere rebuke or even chastisement seemed to me at those times no more\r\nthan a blessed release. None of my brothers or sisters would sleep\r\nanywhere near me. They put me to sleep as far as possible away from the\r\nothers, without thinking that my cries for help would only be louder\r\nand longer; but in the end they got used even to this nightly\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this childish terror, what attracted me so strongly\r\nto the theatre—by which I mean also the stage, the rooms behind the\r\nscenes, and the dressing-rooms—was not so much the desire for\r\nentertainment and amusement such as that which impels the present-day\r\ntheatre-goers, but the fascinating pleasure of finding myself in an\r\nentirely different atmosphere, in a world that was purely fantastic and\r\noften gruesomely attractive. Thus to me a scene, even a wing,\r\nrepresenting a bush, or some costume or characteristic part of it,\r\nseemed to come from another world, to be in some way as attractive as\r\nan apparition, and I felt that contact with it might serve as a lever\r\nto lift me from the dull reality of daily routine to that delightful\r\nregion of spirits. Everything connected with a theatrical performance\r\nhad for me the charm of mystery, it both bewitched and fascinated me,\r\nand while I was trying, with the help of a few playmates, to imitate\r\nthe performance of Der Freischutz, and to devote myself energetically\r\nto reproducing the needful costumes and masks in my grotesque style of\r\npainting, the more elegant contents of my sisters’ wardrobes, in the\r\nbeautifying of which I had often seen the family occupied, exercised a\r\nsubtle charm over my imagination; nay, my heart would beat madly at the\r\nvery touch of one of their dresses.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that, as I already mentioned, our family was not\r\ngiven to outward manifestations of affection, yet the fact that I was\r\nbrought up entirely among feminine surroundings must necessarily have\r\ninfluenced the development of the sensitive side of my nature. Perhaps\r\nit was precisely because my immediate circle was generally rough and\r\nimpetuous, that the opposite characteristics of womanhood, especially\r\nsuch as were connected with the imaginary world of the theatre, created\r\na feeling of such tender longing in me.\r\n\r\nLuckily these fantastic humours, merging from the gruesome into the\r\nmawkish, were counteracted and balanced by more serious influences\r\nundergone at school at the hands of my teachers and schoolfellows. Even\r\nthere, it was chiefly the weird that aroused my keenest interest. I can\r\nhardly judge whether I had what would be called a good head for study.\r\nI think that, in general, what I really liked I was soon able to grasp\r\nwithout much effort, whereas I hardly exerted myself at all in the\r\nstudy of subjects that were uncongenial. This characteristic was most\r\nmarked in regard to arithmetic and, later on, mathematics. In neither\r\nof these subjects did I ever succeed in bringing my mind seriously to\r\nbear upon the tasks that were set me. In the matter of the Classics,\r\ntoo, I paid only just as much attention as was absolutely necessary to\r\nenable me to get a grasp of them; for I was stimulated by the desire to\r\nreproduce them to myself dramatically. In this way Greek particularly\r\nattracted me, because the stories from Greek mythology so seized upon\r\nmy fancy that I tried to imagine their heroes as speaking to me in\r\ntheir native tongue, so as to satisfy my longing for complete\r\nfamiliarity with them. In these circumstances it will be readily\r\nunderstood that the grammar of the language seemed to me merely a\r\ntiresome obstacle, and by no means in itself an interesting branch of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe fact that my study of languages was never very thorough, perhaps\r\nbest explains the fact that I was afterwards so ready to cease\r\ntroubling about them altogether. Not until much later did this study\r\nreally begin to interest me again, and that was only when I learnt to\r\nunderstand its physiological and philosophical side, as it was revealed\r\nto our modern Germanists by the pioneer work of Jakob Grimm. Then, when\r\nit was too late to apply myself thoroughly to a study which at last I\r\nhad learned to appreciate, I regretted that this newer conception of\r\nthe study of languages had not yet found acceptance in our colleges\r\nwhen I was younger.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, by my successes in philological work I managed to attract\r\nthe attention of a young teacher at the Kreuz Grammar School, a Master\r\nof Arts named Sillig, who proved very helpful to me. He often permitted\r\nme to visit him and show him my work, consisting of metric translations\r\nand a few original poems, and he always seemed very pleased with my\r\nefforts in recitation. What he thought of me may best be judged perhaps\r\nfrom the fact that he made me, as a boy of about twelve, recite not\r\nonly ‘Hector’s Farewell’ from the Iliad, but even Hamlet’s celebrated\r\nmonologue. On one occasion, when I was in the fourth form of the\r\nschool, one of my schoolfellows, a boy named Starke, suddenly fell\r\ndead, and the tragic event aroused so much sympathy, that not only did\r\nthe whole school attend the funeral, but the headmaster also ordered\r\nthat a poem should be written in commemoration of the ceremony, and\r\nthat this poem should be published. Of the various poems submitted,\r\namong which there was one by myself, prepared very hurriedly, none\r\nseemed to the master worthy of the honour which he had promised, and he\r\ntherefore announced his intention of substituting one of his own\r\nspeeches in the place of our rejected attempts. Much distressed by this\r\ndecision, I quickly sought out Professor Sillig, with the view of\r\nurging him to intervene on behalf of my poem. We thereupon went through\r\nit together. Its well-constructed and well-rhymed verses, written in\r\nstanzas of eight lines, determined him to revise the whole of it\r\ncarefully. Much of its imagery was bombastic, and far beyond the\r\nconception of a boy of my age. I recollect that in one part I had drawn\r\nextensively from the monologue in Addison’s Cato, spoken by Cato just\r\nbefore his suicide. I had met with this passage in an English grammar,\r\nand it had made a deep impression upon me. The words: ‘The stars shall\r\nfade away, the sun himself grow dim with age, and nature sink in\r\nyears,’ which, at all events, were a direct plagiarism, made Sillig\r\nlaugh—a thing at which I was a little offended. However, I felt very\r\ngrateful to him, for, thanks to the care and rapidity with which he\r\ncleared my poem of these extravagances, it was eventually accepted by\r\nthe headmaster, printed, and widely circulated.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this success was extraordinary, both on my schoolfellows\r\nand on my own family. My mother devoutly folded her hands in\r\nthankfulness, and in my own mind my vocation seemed quite a settled\r\nthing. It was clear, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that I was\r\ndestined to be a poet. Professor Sillig wished me to compose a grand\r\nepic, and suggested as a subject ‘The Battle of Parnassus,’ as\r\ndescribed by Pausanias. His reasons for this choice were based upon the\r\nlegend related by Pausanias, viz., that in the second century B.C. the\r\nMuses from Parnassus aided the combined Greek armies against the\r\ndestructive invasion of the Gauls by provoking a panic among the\r\nlatter. I actually began my heroic poem in hexameter verse, but could\r\nnot get through the first canto.\r\n\r\nNot being far enough advanced in the language to understand the Greek\r\ntragedies thoroughly in the original, my own attempts to construct a\r\ntragedy in the Greek form were greatly influenced by the fact that\r\nquite by accident I came across August Apel’s clever imitation of this\r\nstyle in his striking poems ‘Polyidos’ and ‘Aitolier.’ For my theme I\r\nselected the death of Ulysses, from a fable of Hyginus, according to\r\nwhich the aged hero is killed by his son, the offspring of his union\r\nwith Calypso. But I did not get very far with this work either, before\r\nI gave it up.\r\n\r\nMy mind became so bent upon this sort of thing, that duller studies\r\nnaturally ceased to interest me. The mythology, legends, and, at last,\r\nthe history of Greece alone attracted me.\r\n\r\nI was fond of life, merry with my companions, and always ready for a\r\njoke or an adventure. Moreover, I was constantly forming friendships,\r\nalmost passionate in their ardour, with one or the other of my\r\ncomrades, and in choosing my associates I was mainly influenced by the\r\nextent to which my new acquaintance appealed to my eccentric\r\nimagination. At one time it would be poetising and versifying that\r\ndecided my choice of a friend; at another, theatrical enterprises,\r\nwhile now and then it would be a longing for rambling and mischief.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when I reached my thirteenth year, a great change came\r\nover our family affairs. My sister Rosalie, who had become the chief\r\nsupport of our household, obtained an advantageous engagement at the\r\ntheatre in Prague, whither mother and children removed in 1820, thus\r\ngiving up the Dresden home altogether. I was left behind in Dresden, so\r\nthat I might continue to attend the Kreuz Grammar School until I was\r\nready to go up to the university. I was therefore sent to board and\r\nlodge with a family named Bohme, whose sons I had known at school, and\r\nin whose house I already felt quite at home. With my residence in this\r\nsomewhat rough, poor, and not particularly well-conducted family, my\r\nyears of dissipation began. I no longer enjoyed the quiet retirement\r\nnecessary for work, nor the gentle, spiritual influence of my sisters’\r\ncompanionship. On the contrary, I was plunged into a busy, restless\r\nlife, full of rough horseplay and of quarrels. Nevertheless, it was\r\nthere that I began to experience the influence of the gentler sex in a\r\nmanner hitherto unknown to me, as the grown-up daughters of the family\r\nand their friends often filled the scanty and narrow rooms of the\r\nhouse. Indeed, my first recollections of boyish love date from this\r\nperiod. I remember a very beautiful young girl, whose name, if I am not\r\nmistaken, was Amalie Hoffmann, coming to call at the house one Sunday.\r\nShe was charmingly dressed, and her appearance as she came into the\r\nroom literally struck me dumb with amazement. On other occasions I\r\nrecollect pretending to be too helplessly sleepy to move, so that I\r\nmight be carried up to bed by the girls, that being, as they thought,\r\nthe only remedy for my condition. And I repeated this, because I found,\r\nto my surprise, that their attention under these circumstances brought\r\nme into closer and more gratifying proximity with them.\r\n\r\nThe most important event during this year of separation from my family\r\nwas, however, a short visit I paid to them in Prague. In the middle of\r\nthe winter my mother came to Dresden, and took me hack with her to\r\nPrague for a week. Her way of travelling was quite unique. To the end\r\nof her days she preferred the more dangerous mode of travelling in a\r\nhackney carriage to the quicker journey by mail-coach, so that we spent\r\nthree whole days in the bitter cold on the road from Dresden to Prague.\r\nThe journey over the Bohemian mountains often seemed to be beset with\r\nthe greatest dangers, but happily we survived our thrilling adventures\r\nand at last arrived in Prague, where I was suddenly plunged into\r\nentirely new surroundings.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the thought of leaving Saxony on another visit to\r\nBohemia, and especially Prague, had had quite a romantic attraction for\r\nme. The foreign nationality, the broken German of the people, the\r\npeculiar headgear of the women, the native wines, the harp-girls and\r\nmusicians, and finally, the ever present signs of Catholicism, its\r\nnumerous chapels and shrines, all produced on me a strangely\r\nexhilarating impression. This was probably due to my craze for\r\neverything theatrical and spectacular, as distinguished from simple\r\nbourgeois customs. Above all, the antique splendour and beauty of the\r\nincomparable city of Prague became indelibly stamped on my fancy. Even\r\nin my own family surroundings I found attractions to which I had\r\nhitherto been a stranger. For instance, my sister Ottilie, only two\r\nyears older than myself, had won the devoted friendship of a noble\r\nfamily, that of Count Pachta, two of whose daughters, Jenny and\r\nAuguste, who had long been famed as the leading beauties of Prague, had\r\nbecome fondly attached to her. To me, such people and such a connection\r\nwere something quite novel and enchanting. Besides these, certain beaux\r\nesprits of Prague, among them W. Marsano, a strikingly handsome and\r\ncharming man, were frequent visitors at our house. They often earnestly\r\ndiscussed the tales of Hoffmann, which at that date were comparatively\r\nnew, and had created some sensation. It was now that I made my first\r\nthough rather superficial acquaintance with this romantic visionary,\r\nand so received a stimulus which influenced me for many years even to\r\nthe point of infatuation, and gave me very peculiar ideas of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the following spring, 1827, I repeated this journey from Dresden to\r\nPrague, but this time on foot, and accompanied by my friend Rudolf\r\nBohme. Our tour was full of adventure. We got to within an hour of\r\nTeplitz the first night, and next day we had to get a lift in a wagon,\r\nas we had walked our feet sore; yet this only took us as far as\r\nLowositz, as our funds had quite run out. Under a scorching sun, hungry\r\nand half-fainting, we wandered along bypaths through absolutely unknown\r\ncountry, until at sundown we happened to reach the main road just as an\r\nelegant travelling coach came in sight. I humbled my pride so far as to\r\npretend I was a travelling journeyman, and begged the distinguished\r\ntravellers for alms, while my friend timidly hid himself in the ditch\r\nby the roadside. Luckily we decided to seek shelter for the night in an\r\ninn, where we took counsel whether we should spend the alms just\r\nreceived on a supper or a bed. We decided for the supper, proposing to\r\nspend the night under the open sky. While we were refreshing ourselves,\r\na strange-looking wayfarer entered. He wore a black velvet skull-cap,\r\nto which a metal lyre was attached like a cockade, and on his back he\r\nbore a harp. Very cheerfully he set down his instrument, made himself\r\ncomfortable, and called for a good meal. He intended to stay the night,\r\nand to continue his way next day to Prague, where he lived, and whither\r\nhe was returning from Hanover.\r\n\r\nMy good spirits and courage were stimulated by the jovial manners of\r\nthis merry fellow, who constantly repeated his favourite motto, ‘non\r\nplus ultra.’ We soon struck up an acquaintance, and in return for my\r\nconfidence, the strolling player’s attitude to me was one of almost\r\ntouching sympathy. It was agreed that we should continue our journey\r\ntogether next day on foot. He lent me two twenty-kreutzer pieces (about\r\nninepence), and allowed me to write my Prague address in his\r\npocket-book. I was highly delighted at this personal success. My\r\nharpist grew extravagantly merry; a good deal of Czernosek wine was\r\ndrunk; he sang and played on his harp like a madman, continually\r\nreiterating his ‘non plus ultra’ till at last, overcome with wine, he\r\nfell down on the straw, which had been spread out on the floor for our\r\ncommon bed. When the sun once more peeped in, we could not rouse him,\r\nand we had to make up our minds to set off in the freshness of the\r\nearly morning without him, feeling convinced that the sturdy fellow\r\nwould overtake us during the day. But it was in vain that we looked out\r\nfor him on the road and during our subsequent stay in Prague. Indeed,\r\nit was not until several weeks later that the extraordinary fellow\r\nturned up at my mother’s, not so much to collect payment of his loan,\r\nas to inquire about the welfare of the young friend to whom that loan\r\nhad been made.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of our journey was very fatiguing, and the joy I felt\r\nwhen I at last beheld Prague from the summit of a hill, at about an\r\nhour’s distance, simply beggars description. Approaching the suburbs,\r\nwe were for the second time met by a splendid carriage, from which my\r\nsister Ottilie’s two lovely friends called out to me in astonishment.\r\nThey had recognised me immediately, in spite of my terribly sunburnt\r\nface, blue linen blouse, and bright red cotton cap. Overwhelmed with\r\nshame, and with my heart beating like mad, I could hardly utter a word,\r\nand hurried away to my mother’s to attend at once to the restoration of\r\nmy sunburnt complexion. To this task I devoted two whole days, during\r\nwhich I swathed my face in parsley poultices; and not till then did I\r\nseek the pleasures of society. When, on the return journey, I looked\r\nback once more on Prague from the same hilltop, I burst into tears,\r\nflung myself on the earth, and for a long time could not be induced by\r\nmy astonished companion to pursue the journey. I was downcast for the\r\nrest of the way, and we arrived home in Dresden without any further\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year I again gratified my fancy for long excursions on\r\nfoot by joining a numerous company of grammar school boys, consisting\r\nof pupils of several classes and of various ages, who had decided to\r\nspend their summer holidays in a tour to Leipzig. This journey also\r\nstands out among the memories of my youth, by reason of the strong\r\nimpressions it left behind. The characteristic feature of our party was\r\nthat we all aped the student, by behaving and dressing extravagantly in\r\nthe most approved student fashion. After going as far as Meissen on the\r\nmarket-boat, our path lay off the main road, through villages with\r\nwhich I was as yet unfamiliar. We spent the night in the vast barn of a\r\nvillage inn, and our adventures were of the wildest description. There\r\nwe saw a large marionette show, with almost life-sized figures. Our\r\nentire party settled themselves in the auditorium, where their presence\r\nwas a source of some anxiety to the managers, who had only reckoned on\r\nan audience of peasants. Genovefa was the play given. The ceaseless\r\nsilly jests, and constant interpolations and jeering interruptions, in\r\nwhich our corps of embryo-students indulged, finally aroused the anger\r\neven of the peasants, who had come prepared to weep. I believe I was\r\nthe only one of our party who was pained by these impertinences, and in\r\nspite of involuntary laughter at some of my comrades’ jokes, I not only\r\ndefended the play itself, but also its original, simple-minded\r\naudience. A popular catch-phrase which occurred in the piece has ever\r\nsince remained stamped on my memory. ‘Golo’ instructs the inevitable\r\nKaspar that, when the Count Palatine returns home, he must ‘tickle him\r\nbehind, so that he should feel it in front’ (hinten zu kitzeln, dass er\r\nes vorne fuhle). Kaspar conveys Golo’s order verbatim to the Count, and\r\nthe latter reproaches the unmasked rogue in the following terms,\r\nuttered with the greatest pathos: ‘O Golo, Golo! thou hast told Kaspar\r\nto tickle me behind, so that I shall feel it in front!’\r\n\r\nFrom Grimma our party rode into Leipzig in open carriages, but not\r\nuntil we had first carefully removed all the outward emblems of the\r\nundergraduate, lest the local students we were likely to meet might\r\nmake us rue our presumption.\r\n\r\nSince my first visit, when I was eight years old, I had only once\r\nreturned to Leipzig, and then for a very brief stay, and under\r\ncircumstances very similar to those of the earlier visit. I now renewed\r\nmy fantastic impressions of the Thome house, but this time, owing to my\r\nmore advanced education, I looked forward to more intelligent\r\nintercourse with my uncle Adolph. An opening for this was soon provided\r\nby my joyous astonishment on learning that a bookcase in the large\r\nanteroom, containing a goodly collection of books, was my property,\r\nhaving been left me by my father. I went through the books with my\r\nuncle, selected at once a number of Latin authors in the handsome\r\nZweibruck edition, along with sundry attractive looking works of poetry\r\nand belles-lettres, and arranged for them to be sent to Dresden. During\r\nthis visit I was very much interested in the life of the students. In\r\naddition to my impressions of the theatre and of Prague, now came those\r\nof the so-called swaggering undergraduate. A great change had taken\r\nplace in this class. When, as a lad of eight, I had my first glimpse of\r\nstudents, their long hair, their old German costume with the black\r\nvelvet skull-cap and the shirt collar turned back from the bare neck,\r\nhad quite taken my fancy. But since that time the old student\r\n‘associations’ which affected this fashion had disappeared in the face\r\nof police prosecutions. On the other hand, the national student clubs,\r\nno less peculiar to Germans, had become conspicuous. These clubs\r\nadopted, more or less, the fashion of the day, but with some little\r\nexaggeration. Albeit, their dress was clearly distinguishable from that\r\nof other classes, owing to its picturesqueness, and especially its\r\ndisplay of the various club-colours. The ‘Comment,’ that compendium of\r\npedantic rules of conduct for the preservation of a defiant and\r\nexclusive esprit de corps, as opposed to the bourgeois classes, had its\r\nfantastic side, just as the most philistine peculiarities of the\r\nGermans have, if you probe them deeply enough. To me it represented the\r\nidea of emancipation from the yoke of school and family. The longing to\r\nbecome a student coincided unfortunately with my growing dislike for\r\ndrier studies and with my ever-increasing fondness for cultivating\r\nromantic poetry. The results of this soon showed themselves in my\r\nresolute attempts to make a change.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my confirmation, at Easter, 1827, I had considerable\r\ndoubt about this ceremony, and I already felt a serious falling off of\r\nmy reverence for religious observances. The boy who, not many years\r\nbefore, had gazed with agonised sympathy on the altarpiece in the Kreuz\r\nKirche (Church of the Holy Cross), and had yearned with ecstatic\r\nfervour to hang upon the Cross in place of the Saviour, had now so far\r\nlost his veneration for the clergyman, whose preparatory confirmation\r\nclasses he attended, as to be quite ready to make fun of him, and even\r\nto join with his comrades in withholding part of his class fees, and\r\nspending the money in sweets. How matters stood with me spiritually was\r\nrevealed to me, almost to my horror, at the Communion service, when I\r\nwalked in procession with my fellow-communicants to the altar to the\r\nsound of organ and choir. The shudder with which I received the Bread\r\nand Wine was so ineffaceably stamped on my memory, that I never again\r\npartook of the Communion, lest I should do so with levity. To avoid\r\nthis was all the easier for me, seeing that among Protestants such\r\nparticipation is not compulsory.\r\n\r\nI soon, however, seized, or rather created, an opportunity of forcing a\r\nbreach with the Kreuz Grammar School, and thus compelled my family to\r\nlet me go to Leipzig. In self-defence against what I considered an\r\nunjust punishment with which I was threatened by the assistant\r\nheadmaster, Baumgarten-Crusius, for whom I otherwise had great respect,\r\nI asked to be discharged immediately from the school on the ground of\r\nsudden summons to join my family in Leipzig. I had already left the\r\nBohme household three months before, and now lived alone in a small\r\ngarret, where I was waited on by the widow of a court plate-washer, who\r\nat every meal served up the familiar thin Saxon coffee as almost my\r\nsole nourishment. In this attic I did little else but write verses.\r\nHere, too, I formed the first outlines of that stupendous tragedy which\r\nafterwards filled my family with such consternation. The irregular\r\nhabits I acquired through this premature domestic independence induced\r\nmy anxious mother to consent very readily to my removal to Leipzig, the\r\nmore so as a part of our scattered family had already migrated there.\r\n\r\nMy longing for Leipzig, originally aroused by the fantastic impressions\r\nI had gained there, and later by my enthusiasm for a student’s life,\r\nhad recently been still further stimulated. I had seen scarcely\r\nanything of my sister Louisa, at that time a girl of about twenty-two,\r\nas she had gone to the theatre of Breslau shortly after our\r\nstepfather’s death. Quite recently she had been in Dresden for a few\r\ndays on her way to Leipzig, having accepted an engagement at the\r\ntheatre there. This meeting with my almost unknown sister, her hearty\r\nmanifestations of joy at seeing me again, as well as her sprightly,\r\nmerry disposition, quite won my heart. To live with her seemed an\r\nalluring prospect, especially as my mother and Ottilie had joined her\r\nfor a while. For the first time a sister had treated me with some\r\ntenderness. When at last I reached Leipzig at Christmas in the same\r\nyear (1827), and there found my mother with Ottilie and Cecilia (my\r\nhalf-sister), I fancied myself in heaven. Great changes, however, had\r\nalready taken place. Louisa was betrothed to a respected and well-to-do\r\nbookseller, Friedrich Brockhaus. This gathering together of the\r\nrelatives of the penniless bride-elect did not seem to trouble her\r\nremarkably kind-hearted fiance. But my sister may have become uneasy on\r\nthe subject, for she soon gave me to understand that she was not taking\r\nit quite in good part. Her desire to secure an entree into the higher\r\nsocial circles of bourgeois life naturally produced a marked change in\r\nher manner, at one time so full of fun, and of this I gradually became\r\nso keenly sensible that finally we were estranged for a time. Moreover,\r\nI unfortunately gave her good cause to reprove my conduct. After I got\r\nto Leipzig I quite gave up my studies and all regular school work,\r\nprobably owing to the arbitrary and pedantic system in vogue at the\r\nschool there.\r\n\r\nIn Leipzig there were two higher-class schools, one called St. Thomas’s\r\nSchool, and the other, and the more modern, St. Nicholas’s School. The\r\nlatter at that time enjoyed a better reputation than the former; so\r\nthere I had to go. But the council of teachers before whom I appeared\r\nfor my entrance examination at the New Year (1828) thought fit to\r\nmaintain the dignity of their school by placing me for a time in the\r\nupper third form, whereas at the Kreuz Grammar School in Dresden I had\r\nbeen in the second form. My disgust at having to lay aside my\r\nHomer—from which I had already made written translations of twelve\r\nsongs—and take up the lighter Greek prose writers was indescribable. It\r\nhurt my feelings so deeply, and so influenced my behaviour, that I\r\nnever made a friend of any teacher in the school. The unsympathetic\r\ntreatment I met with made me all the more obstinate, and various other\r\ncircumstances in my position only added to this feeling. While student\r\nlife, as I saw it day by day, inspired me ever more and more with its\r\nrebellious spirit, I unexpectedly met with another cause for despising\r\nthe dry monotony of school regime. I refer to the influence of my\r\nuncle, Adolph Wagner, which, though he was long unconscious of it, went\r\na long way towards moulding the growing stripling that I then was.\r\n\r\nThe fact that my romantic tastes were not based solely on a tendency to\r\nsuperficial amusement was shown by my ardent attachment to this learned\r\nrelative. In his manner and conversation he was certainly very\r\nattractive; the many-sidedness of his knowledge, which embraced not\r\nonly philology but also philosophy and general poetic literature,\r\nrendered intercourse with him a most entertaining pastime, as all those\r\nwho knew him used to admit. On the other hand, the fact that he was\r\ndenied the gift of writing with equal charm, or clearness, was a\r\nsingular defect which seriously lessened his influence upon the\r\nliterary world, and, in fact, often made him appear ridiculous, as in a\r\nwritten argument he would perpetrate the most pompous and involved\r\nsentences. This weakness could not have alarmed me, because in the hazy\r\nperiod of my youth the more incomprehensible any literary extravagance\r\nwas, the more I admired it; besides which, I had more experience of his\r\nconversation than of his writings. He also seemed to find pleasure in\r\nassociating with the lad who could listen with so much heart and soul.\r\nYet unfortunately, possibly in the fervour of his discourses, of which\r\nhe was not a little proud, he forgot that their substance, as well as\r\ntheir form, was far above my youthful powers of comprehension. I called\r\ndaily to accompany him on his constitutional walk beyond the city\r\ngates, and I shrewdly suspect that we often provoked the smiles of\r\nthose passers-by who overheard the profound and often earnest\r\ndiscussions between us. The subjects generally ranged over everything\r\nserious or sublime throughout the whole realm of knowledge. I took the\r\nmost enthusiastic interest in his copious library, and tasted eagerly\r\nof almost all branches of literature, without really grounding myself\r\nin any one of them.\r\n\r\nMy uncle was delighted to find in me a very willing listener to his\r\nrecital of classic tragedies. He had made a translation of Oedipus,\r\nand, according to his intimate friend Tieck, justly flattered himself\r\non being an excellent reader.\r\n\r\nI remember once, when he was sitting at his desk reading out a Greek\r\ntragedy to me, it did not annoy him when I fell fast asleep, and he\r\nafterwards pretended he had not noticed it. I was also induced to spend\r\nmy evenings with him, owing to the friendly and genial hospitality his\r\nwife showed me. A very great change had come over my uncle’s life since\r\nmy first acquaintance with him at Jeannette Thome’s. The home which he,\r\ntogether with his sister Friederike, had found in his friend’s house\r\nseemed, as time went on, to have brought in its train duties that were\r\nirksome. As his literary work assured him a modest income, he\r\neventually deemed it more in accordance with his dignity to make a home\r\nof his own. A friend of his, of the same age as himself, the sister of\r\nthe aesthete Wendt of Leipzig, who afterwards became famous, was chosen\r\nby him to keep house for him. Without saying a word to Jeannette,\r\ninstead of going for his usual afternoon walk he went to the church\r\nwith his chosen bride, and got through the marriage ceremonies as\r\nquickly as possible; and it was only on his return that he informed us\r\nhe was leaving, and would have his things removed that very day. He\r\nmanaged to meet the consternation, perhaps also the reproaches, of his\r\nelderly friend with quiet composure; and to the end of his life he\r\ncontinued his regular daily visits to ‘Mam’selle Thome,’ who at times\r\nwould coyly pretend to sulk. It was only poor Friederike who seemed\r\nobliged at times to atone for her brother’s sudden unfaithfulness.\r\n\r\nWhat attracted me in my uncle most strongly was his blunt contempt of\r\nthe modern pedantry in State, Church, and School, to which he gave vent\r\nwith some humour. Despite the great moderation of his usual views on\r\nlife, he yet produced on me the effect of a thorough free-thinker. I\r\nwas highly delighted by his contempt for the pedantry of the schools.\r\nOnce, when I had come into serious conflict with all the teachers of\r\nthe Nicolai School, and the rector of the school had approached my\r\nuncle, as the only male representative of my family, with a serious\r\ncomplaint about my behaviour, my uncle asked me during a stroll round\r\nthe town, with a calm smile as though he were speaking to one of his\r\nown age, what I had been up to with the people at school. I explained\r\nthe whole affair to him, and described the punishment to which I had\r\nbeen subjected, and which seemed to me unjust. He pacified me, and\r\nexhorted me to be patient, telling me to comfort myself with the\r\nSpanish proverb, un rey no puede morir, which he explained as meaning\r\nthat the ruler of a school must of necessity always be in the right.\r\n\r\nHe could not, of course, help noticing, to his alarm, the effect upon\r\nme of this kind of conversation, which I was far too young to\r\nappreciate. Although it annoyed me one day, when I wanted to begin\r\nreading Goethe’s Faust, to hear him say quietly that I was too young to\r\nunderstand it, yet, according to my thinking, his other conversations\r\nabout our own great poets, and even about Shakespeare and Dante, had\r\nmade me so familiar with these sublime figures that I had now for some\r\ntime been secretly busy working out the great tragedy I had already\r\nconceived in Dresden. Since my trouble at school I had devoted all my\r\nenergies, which ought by rights to have been exclusively directed to my\r\nschool duties, to the accomplishment of this task. In this secret work\r\nI had only one confidante, my sister Ottilie, who now lived with me at\r\nmy mother’s. I can remember the misgivings and alarm which the first\r\nconfidential communication of my great poetic enterprise aroused in my\r\ngood sister; yet she affectionately suffered the tortures I sometimes\r\ninflicted on her by reciting to her in secret, but not without emotion,\r\nportions of my work as it progressed. Once, when I was reciting to her\r\none of the most gruesome scenes, a heavy thunderstorm came on. When the\r\nlightning flashed quite close to us, and the thunder rolled, my sister\r\nfelt bound to implore me to stop; but she soon found it was hopeless,\r\nand continued to endure it with touching devotion.\r\n\r\nBut a more significant storm was brewing on the horizon of my life. My\r\nneglect of school reached such a point that it could not but lead to a\r\nrupture. Whilst my dear mother had no presentiment of this, I awaited\r\nthe catastrophe with longing rather than with fear.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet this crisis with dignity I at length decided to\r\nsurprise my family by disclosing to them the secret of my tragedy,\r\nwhich was now completed. They were to be informed of this great event\r\nby my uncle. I thought I could rely upon his hearty recognition of my\r\nvocation as a great poet on account of the deep harmony between us on\r\nall other questions of life, science, and art. I therefore sent him my\r\nvoluminous manuscript, with a long letter which I thought would please\r\nhim immensely. In this I communicated to him first my ideas with regard\r\nto the St. Nicholas’s School, and then my firm determination from that\r\ntime forward not to allow any mere school pedantry to check my free\r\ndevelopment. But the event turned out very different from what I had\r\nexpected. It was a great shock to them. My uncle, quite conscious that\r\nhe had been indiscreet, paid a visit to my mother and brother-in-law,\r\nin order to report the misfortune that had befallen the family,\r\nreproaching himself for the fact that his influence over me had not\r\nalways, perhaps, been for my good. To me he wrote a serious letter of\r\ndiscouragement; and to this day I cannot understand why he showed so\r\nsmall a sense of humour in understanding my bad behaviour. To my\r\nsurprise he merely said that he reproached himself for having corrupted\r\nme by conversations unsuited to my years, but he made no attempt to\r\nexplain to me good-naturedly the error of my ways.\r\n\r\nThe crime this boy of fifteen had committed was, as I said before, to\r\nhave written a great tragedy, entitled Leubald und Adelaïde.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript of this drama has unfortunately been lost, but I can\r\nstill see it clearly in my mind’s eye. The handwriting was most\r\naffected, and the backward-sloping tall letters with which I had aimed\r\nat giving it an air of distinction had already been compared by one of\r\nmy teachers to Persian hieroglyphics. In this composition I had\r\nconstructed a drama in which I had drawn largely upon Shakespeare’s\r\nHamlet, King Lear, and Macbeth, and Goethe’s Götz van Berlichingen. The\r\nplot was really based on a modification of Hamlet, the difference\r\nconsisting in the fact that my hero is so completely carried away by\r\nthe appearance of the ghost of his father, who has been murdered under\r\nsimilar circumstances, and demands vengeance, that he is driven to\r\nfearful deeds of violence; and, with a series of murders on his\r\nconscience, he eventually goes mad. Leubald, whose character is a\r\nmixture of Hamlet and Harry Hotspur, had promised his father’s ghost to\r\nwipe from the face of the earth the whole race of Roderick, as the\r\nruthless murderer of the best of fathers was named. After having slain\r\nRoderick himself in mortal combat, and subsequently all his sons and\r\nother relations who supported him, there was only one obstacle that\r\nprevented Leubald from fulfilling the dearest wish of his heart, which\r\nwas to be united in death with the shade of his father: a child of\r\nRoderick’s was still alive. During the storming of his castle the\r\nmurderer’s daughter had been carried away into safety by a faithful\r\nsuitor, whom she, however, detested. I had an irresistible impulse to\r\ncall this maiden ‘Adelaïde.’ As even at that early age I was a great\r\nenthusiast for everything really German, I can only account for the\r\nobviously un-German name of my heroine by my infatuation for\r\nBeethoven’s Adelaïde, whose tender refrain seemed to me the symbol of\r\nall loving appeals. The course of my drama was now characterised by the\r\nstrange delays which took place in the accomplishment of this last\r\nmurder of vengeance, the chief obstacle to which lay in the sudden\r\npassionate love which arose between Leubald and Adelaïde. I succeeded\r\nin representing the birth and avowal of this love by means of\r\nextraordinary adventures. Adelaïde was once more stolen away by a\r\nrobber-knight from the lover who had been sheltering her. After Leubald\r\nhad thereupon sacrificed the lover and all his relations, he hastened\r\nto the robber’s castle, driven thither less by a thirst for blood than\r\nby a longing for death. For this reason he regrets his inability to\r\nstorm the robber’s castle forthwith, because it is well defended, and,\r\nmoreover, night is fast falling; he is therefore obliged to pitch his\r\ntent. After raving for a while he sinks down for the first time\r\nexhausted, but being urged, like his prototype Hamlet, by the spirit of\r\nhis father to complete his vow of vengeance, he himself suddenly falls\r\ninto the power of the enemy during a night assault. In the subterranean\r\ndungeons of the castle he meets Roderick’s daughter for the first time.\r\nShe is a prisoner like himself, and is craftily devising flight. Under\r\ncircumstances in which she produces on him the impression of a heavenly\r\nvision, she makes her appearance before him. They fall in love, and fly\r\ntogether into the wilderness, where they realise that they are deadly\r\nenemies. The incipient insanity which was already noticeable in Leubald\r\nbreaks out more violently after this discovery, and everything that can\r\nbe done to intensify it is contributed by the ghost of his father,\r\nwhich continually comes between the advances of the lovers. But this\r\nghost is not the only disturber of the conciliating love of Leubald and\r\nAdelaïde. The ghost of Roderick also appears, and according to the\r\nmethod followed by Shakespeare in Richard III., he is joined by the\r\nghosts of all the other members of Adelaïde’s family whom Leubald has\r\nslain. From the incessant importunities of these ghosts Leubald seeks\r\nto free himself by means of sorcery, and calls to his aid a rascal\r\nnamed Flamming. One of Macbeth’s witches is summoned to lay the ghosts;\r\nas she is unable to do this efficiently, the furious Leubald sends her\r\nalso to the devil; but with her dying breath she despatches the whole\r\ncrowd of spirits who serve her to join the ghosts of those already\r\npursuing him. Leubald, tormented beyond endurance, and now at last\r\nraving mad, turns against his beloved, who is the apparent cause of all\r\nhis misery. He stabs her in his fury; then finding himself suddenly at\r\npeace, he sinks his head into her lap, and accepts her last caresses as\r\nher life-blood streams over his own dying body.\r\n\r\nI had not omitted the smallest detail that could give this plot its\r\nproper colouring, and had drawn on all my knowledge of the tales of the\r\nold knights, and my acquaintance with Lear and Macbeth, to furnish my\r\ndrama with the most vivid situations. But one of the chief\r\ncharacteristics of its poetical form I took from the pathetic,\r\nhumorous, and powerful language of Shakespeare. The boldness of my\r\ngrandiloquent and bombastic expressions roused my uncle Adolph’s alarm\r\nand astonishment. He was unable to understand how I could have selected\r\nand used with inconceivable exaggeration precisely the most extravagant\r\nforms of speech to be found in Lear and Götz von Berlichingen.\r\nNevertheless, even after everybody had deafened me with their laments\r\nover my lost time and perverted talents, I was still conscious of a\r\nwonderful secret solace in the face of the calamity that had befallen\r\nme. I knew, a fact that no one else could know, namely, that my work\r\ncould only be rightly judged when set to the music which I had resolved\r\nto write for it, and which I intended to start composing immediately.\r\n\r\nI must now explain my position with respect to music hitherto. For this\r\npurpose I must go back to my earliest attempts in the art. In my family\r\ntwo of my sisters were musical; the elder one, Rosalie, played the\r\npiano, without, however, displaying any marked talent. Clara was more\r\ngifted; in addition to a great deal of musical feeling, and a fine rich\r\ntouch on the piano, she possessed a particularly sympathetic voice, the\r\ndevelopment of which was so premature and remarkable that, under the\r\ntuition of Mieksch, her singing master, who was famous at that time,\r\nshe was apparently ready for the role of a prima donna as early as her\r\nsixteenth year, and made her debut at Dresden in Italian opera as\r\n‘Cenerentola’ in Rossini’s opera of that name. Incidentally I may\r\nremark that this premature development proved injurious to Clara’s\r\nvoice, and was detrimental to her whole career. As I have said, music\r\nwas represented in our family by these two sisters. It was chiefly\r\nowing to Clara’s career that the musical conductor C. M. von Weber\r\noften came to our house. His visits were varied by those of the great\r\nmale-soprano Sassaroli; and in addition to these two representatives of\r\nGerman and Italian music, we also had the company of Mieksch, her\r\nsinging master. It was on these occasions that I as a child first heard\r\nGerman and Italian music discussed, and learnt that any one who wished\r\nto ingratiate himself with the Court must show a preference for Italian\r\nmusic, a fact which led to very practical results in our family\r\ncouncil. Clara’s talent, while her voice was still sound, was the\r\nobject of competition between the representatives of Italian and German\r\nopera. I can remember quite distinctly that from the very beginning I\r\ndeclared myself in favour of German opera; my choice was determined by\r\nthe tremendous impression made on me by the two figures of Sassaroli\r\nand Weber. The Italian male-soprano, a huge pot-bellied giant,\r\nhorrified me with his high effeminate voice, his astonishing\r\nvolubility, and his incessant screeching laughter. In spite of his\r\nboundless good-nature and amiability, particularly to my family, I took\r\nan uncanny dislike to him. On account of this dreadful person, the\r\nsound of Italian, either spoken or sung, seemed to my ears almost\r\ndiabolical; and when, in consequence of my poor sister’s misfortune, I\r\nheard them often talking about Italian intrigues and cabals, I\r\nconceived so strong a dislike for everything connected with this nation\r\nthat even in much later years I used to feel myself carried away by an\r\nimpulse of utter detestation and abhorrence.\r\n\r\nThe less frequent visits of Weber, on the other hand, seemed to have\r\nproduced upon me those first sympathetic impressions which I have never\r\nsince lost. In contrast to Sassaroli’s repulsive figure, Weber’s really\r\nrefined, delicate, and intellectual appearance excited my ecstatic\r\nadmiration. His narrow face and finely-cut features, his vivacious\r\nthough often half-closed eyes, captivated and thrilled me; whilst even\r\nthe bad limp with which he walked, and which I often noticed from our\r\nwindows when the master was making his way home past our house from the\r\nfatiguing rehearsals, stamped the great musician in my imagination as\r\nan exceptional and almost superhuman being. When, as a boy of nine, my\r\nmother introduced me to him, and he asked me what I was going to be,\r\nwhether I wanted perhaps to be a musician, my mother told him that,\r\nthough I was indeed quite mad on Freischutz, yet she had as yet seen\r\nnothing in me which indicated any musical talent.\r\n\r\nThis showed correct observation on my mother’s part; nothing had made\r\nso great an impression on me as the music of Freischutz, and I tried in\r\nevery possible way to procure a repetition of the impressions I had\r\nreceived from it, but, strange to say, least of all by the study of\r\nmusic itself. Instead of this, I contented myself with hearing bits\r\nfrom Freischutz played by my sisters. Yet my passion for it gradually\r\ngrew so strong that I can remember taking a particular fancy for a\r\nyoung man called Spiess, chiefly because he could play the overture to\r\nFreischutz, which I used to ask him to do whenever I met him. It was\r\nchiefly the introduction to this overture which at last led me to\r\nattempt, without ever having received any instruction on the piano, to\r\nplay this piece in my own peculiar way, for, oddly enough, I was the\r\nonly child in our family who had not been given music lessons. This was\r\nprobably due to my mother’s anxiety to keep me away from any artistic\r\ninterests of this kind in case they might arouse in me a longing for\r\nthe theatre.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about twelve years old, however, my mother engaged a tutor\r\nfor me named Humann, from whom I received regular music lessons, though\r\nonly of a very mediocre description. As soon as I had acquired a very\r\nimperfect knowledge of fingering I begged to be allowed to play\r\novertures in the form of duets, always keeping Weber as the goal of my\r\nambition. When at length I had got so far as to be able to play the\r\noverture to Freischutz myself, though in a very faulty manner, I felt\r\nthe object of my study had been attained, and I had no inclination to\r\ndevote any further attention to perfecting my technique.\r\n\r\nYet I had attained this much: I was no longer dependent for music on\r\nthe playing of others; from this time forth I used to try and play,\r\nalbeit very imperfectly, everything I wanted to know. I also tried\r\nMozart’s Don Juan, but was unable to get any pleasure out of it, mainly\r\nbecause the Italian text in the arrangement for the piano placed the\r\nmusic in a frivolous light in my eyes, and much in it seemed to me\r\ntrivial and unmanly. (I can remember that when my sister used to sing\r\nZerlinen’s ariette, Batti, batti, ben Masetto, the music repelled me,\r\nas it seemed so mawkish and effeminate.)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my bent for music grew stronger and stronger, and I\r\nnow tried to possess myself of my favourite pieces by making my own\r\ncopies. I can remember the hesitation with which my mother for the\r\nfirst time gave me the money to buy the scored paper on which I copied\r\nout Weber’s Lutzow’s Jagd, which was the first piece of music I\r\ntranscribed.\r\n\r\nMusic was still a secondary occupation with me when the news of Weber’s\r\ndeath and the longing to learn his music to Oberon fanned my enthusiasm\r\ninto flame again. This received fresh impetus from the afternoon\r\nconcerts in the Grosser Garten at Dresden, where I often heard my\r\nfavourite music played by Zillmann’s Town Band, as I thought,\r\nexceedingly well. The mysterious joy I felt in hearing an orchestra\r\nplay quite close to me still remains one of my most pleasant memories.\r\nThe mere tuning up of the instruments put me in a state of mystic\r\nexcitement; even the striking of fifths on the violin seemed to me like\r\na greeting from the spirit world—which, I may mention incidentally, had\r\na very real meaning for me. When I was still almost a baby, the sound\r\nof these fifths, which has always excited me, was closely associated in\r\nmy mind with ghosts and spirits. I remember that even much later in\r\nlife I could never pass the small palace of Prince Anthony, at the end\r\nof the Ostra Allee in Dresden, without a shudder; for it was there I\r\nhad first heard the sound of a violin, a very common experience to me\r\nafterwards. It was close by me, and seemed to my ears to come from the\r\nstone figures with which this palace is adorned, some of which are\r\nprovided with musical instruments. When I took up my post as musical\r\nconductor at Dresden, and had to pay my official visit to Morgenroth,\r\nthe President of the Concert Committee, an elderly gentleman who lived\r\nfor many years opposite that princely palace, it seemed odd to find\r\nthat the player of fifths who had so strongly impressed my musical\r\nfancy as a boy was anything but a supernatural spectre. And when I saw\r\nthe well-known picture in which a skeleton plays on his violin to an\r\nold man on his deathbed, the ghostly character of those very notes\r\nimpressed itself with particular force upon my childish imagination.\r\nWhen at last, as a young man, I used to listen to the Zillmann\r\nOrchestra in the Grosser Garten almost every afternoon, one may imagine\r\nthe rapturous thrill with which I drew in all the chaotic variety of\r\nsound that I heard as the orchestra tuned up: the long drawn A of the\r\noboe, which seemed like a call from the dead to rouse the other\r\ninstruments, never failed to raise all my nerves to a feverish pitch of\r\ntension, and when the swelling C in the overture to Freischutz told me\r\nthat I had stepped, as it were with both feet, right into the magic\r\nrealm of awe. Any one who had been watching me at that moment could\r\nhardly have failed to see the state I was in, and this in spite of the\r\nfact that I was such a bad performer on the piano.\r\n\r\nAnother work also exercised a great fascination over me, namely, the\r\noverture to Fidelio in E major, the introduction to which affected me\r\ndeeply. I asked my sisters about Beethoven, and learned that the news\r\nof his death had just arrived. Obsessed as I still was by the terrible\r\ngrief caused by Weber’s death, this fresh loss, due to the decease of\r\nthis great master of melody, who had only just entered my life, filled\r\nme with strange anguish, a feeling nearly akin to my childish dread of\r\nthe ghostly fifths on the violin. It was now Beethoven’s music that I\r\nlonged to know more thoroughly; I came to Leipzig, and found his music\r\nto Egmont on the piano at my sister Louisa’s. After that I tried to get\r\nhold of his sonatas. At last, at a concert at the Gewandthaus, I heard\r\none of the master’s symphonies for the first time; it was the Symphony\r\nin A major. The effect on me was indescribable. To this must be added\r\nthe impression produced on me by Beethoven’s features, which I saw in\r\nthe lithographs that were circulated everywhere at that time, and by\r\nthe fact that he was deaf, and lived a quiet secluded life. I soon\r\nconceived an image of him in my mind as a sublime and unique\r\nsupernatural being, with whom none could compare. This image was\r\nassociated in my brain with that of Shakespeare; in ecstatic dreams I\r\nmet both of them, saw and spoke to them, and on awakening found myself\r\nbathed in tears.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that I came across Mozart’s Requiem, which formed\r\nthe starting-point of my enthusiastic absorption in the works of that\r\nmaster. His second finale to Don Juan inspired me to include him in my\r\nspirit world.\r\n\r\nI was now filled with a desire to compose, as I had before been to\r\nwrite verse. I had, however, in this case to master the technique of an\r\nentirely separate and complicated subject. This presented greater\r\ndifficulties than I had met with in writing verse, which came to me\r\nfairly easily. It was these difficulties that drove me to adopt a\r\ncareer which bore some resemblance to that of a professional musician,\r\nwhose future distinction would be to win the titles of Conductor and\r\nWriter of Opera.\r\n\r\nI now wanted to set Leubald und Adelaïde to music, similar to that\r\nwhich Beethoven wrote to Goethe’s Egmont; the various ghosts from the\r\nspirit world, who were each to display different characteristics, were\r\nto borrow their own distinctive colouring from appropriate musical\r\naccompaniment. In order to acquire the necessary technique of\r\ncomposition quickly I studied Logier’s Methode des Generalbasses, a\r\nwork which was specially recommended to me at a musical lending library\r\nas a suitable text-book from which this art might be easily mastered. I\r\nhave distinct recollections that the financial difficulties with which\r\nI was continually harassed throughout my life began at this time. I\r\nborrowed Logier’s book on the weekly payment system, in the fond hope\r\nof having to pay for it only during a few weeks out of the savings of\r\nmy weekly pocket-money. But the weeks ran on into months, and I was\r\nstill unable to compose as well as I wished. Mr. Frederick Wieck, whose\r\ndaughter afterwards married Robert Schumann, was at that time the\r\nproprietor of that lending library. He kept sending me troublesome\r\nreminders of the debt I owed him; and when my bill had almost reached\r\nthe price of Logier’s book I had to make a clean breast of the matter\r\nto my family, who thus not only learnt of my financial difficulties in\r\ngeneral, but also of my latest transgression into the domain of music,\r\nfrom which, of course, at the very most, they expected nothing better\r\nthan a repetition of Leubald und Adelaïde.\r\n\r\nThere was great consternation at home; my mother, sister, and\r\nbrother-in-law, with anxious faces, discussed how my studies should be\r\nsuperintended in future, to prevent my having any further opportunity\r\nfor transgressing in this way. No one, however, yet knew the real state\r\nof affairs at school, and they hoped I would soon see the error of my\r\nways in this case as I had in my former craze for poetry.\r\n\r\nBut other domestic changes were taking place which necessitated my\r\nbeing for some little time alone in our house at Leipzig during the\r\nsummer of 1829, when I was left entirely to my own devices. It was\r\nduring this period that my passion for music rose to an extraordinary\r\ndegree. I had secretly been taking lessons in harmony from G. Muller,\r\nafterwards organist at Altenburg, an excellent musician belonging to\r\nthe Leipzig orchestra. Although the payment of these lessons was also\r\ndestined to get me into hot water at home later on, I could not even\r\nmake up to my teacher for the delay in the payment of his fees by\r\ngiving him the pleasure of watching me improve in my studies. His\r\nteaching and exercises soon filled me with the greatest disgust, as to\r\nmy mind it all seemed so dry. For me music was a spirit, a noble and\r\nmystic monster, and any attempt to regulate it seemed to lower it in my\r\neyes. I gathered much more congenial instruction about it from\r\nHoffmann’s Phantasiestucken than from my Leipzig orchestra player; and\r\nnow came the time when I really lived and breathed in Hoffmann’s\r\nartistic atmosphere of ghosts and spirits. With my head quite full of\r\nKreissler, Krespel, and other musical spectres from my favourite\r\nauthor, I imagined that I had at last found in real life a creature who\r\nresembled them: this ideal musician in whom for a time I fancied I had\r\ndiscovered a second Kreissler was a man called Flachs. He was a tall,\r\nexceedingly thin man, with a very narrow head and an extraordinary way\r\nof walking, moving, and speaking, whom I had seen at all those open-air\r\nconcerts which formed my principal source of musical education. He was\r\nalways with the members of the orchestra, speaking exceedingly quickly,\r\nfirst to one and then the other; for they all knew him, and seemed to\r\nlike him. The fact that they were making fun of him I only learned, to\r\nmy great confusion, much later. I remember having noticed this strange\r\nfigure from my earliest days in Dresden, and I gathered from the\r\nconversations which I overheard that he was indeed well known to all\r\nDresden musicians. This circumstance alone was sufficient to make me\r\ntake a great interest in him; but the point about him which attracted\r\nme more than anything was the manner in which he listened to the\r\nvarious items in the programme: he used to give peculiar, convulsive\r\nnods of his head, and blow out his cheeks as though with sighs. All\r\nthis I regarded as a sign of spiritual ecstasy. I noticed, moreover,\r\nthat he was quite alone, that he belonged to no party, and paid no\r\nattention to anything in the garden save the music; whereupon my\r\nidentification of this curious being with the conductor Kreissler\r\nseemed quite natural. I was determined to make his acquaintance, and I\r\nsucceeded in doing so. Who shall describe my delight when, on going to\r\ncall on him at his rooms for the first time, I found innumerable\r\nbundles of scores! I had as yet never seen a score. It is true I\r\ndiscovered, to my regret, that he possessed nothing either by\r\nBeethoven, Mozart, or Weber; in fact, nothing but immense quantities of\r\nworks, masses, and cantatas by composers such as Staerkel, Stamitz,\r\nSteibelt, etc., all of whom were entirely unknown to me. Yet Flachs was\r\nable to tell me so much that was good about them that the respect which\r\nI felt for scores in general helped me to overcome my regret at not\r\nfinding anything by my beloved masters. It is true I learnt later that\r\npoor Flachs had only come into the possession of these particular\r\nscores through unscrupulous dealers, who had traded on his weakness of\r\nintellect and palmed off this worthless music on him for large sums of\r\nmoney. At all events, they were scores, and that was quite enough for\r\nme. Flachs and I became most intimate; we were always seen going about\r\ntogether—I, a lanky boy of sixteen, and this weird, shaky flaxpole. The\r\ndoors of my deserted home were often opened for this strange guest, who\r\nmade me play my compositions to him while he ate bread and cheese. In\r\nreturn, he once arranged one of my airs for wind instruments, and, to\r\nmy astonishment, it was actually accepted and played by the band in\r\nKintschy’s Swiss Chalet. That this man had not the smallest capacity to\r\nteach me anything never once occurred to me; I was so firmly convinced\r\nof his originality that there was no need for him to prove it further\r\nthan by listening patiently to my enthusiastic outpourings. But as, in\r\ncourse of time, several of his own friends joined us, I could not help\r\nnoticing that the worthy Flachs was regarded by them all as a\r\nhalf-witted fool. At first this merely pained me, but a strange\r\nincident unexpectedly occurred which converted me to the general\r\nopinion about him. Flachs was a man of some means, and had fallen into\r\nthe toils of a young lady of dubious character who he believed was\r\ndeeply in love with him. One day, without warning, I found his house\r\nclosed to me, and discovered, to my astonishment, that jealousy was the\r\ncause. The unexpected discovery of this liaison, which was my first\r\nexperience of such a case, filled me with a strange horror. My friend\r\nsuddenly appeared to me even more mad than he really was. I felt so\r\nashamed of my persistent blindness that for some time to come I never\r\nwent to any of the garden concerts for fear I should meet my sham\r\nKreissler.\r\n\r\nBy this time I had composed my first Sonata in D minor. I had also\r\nbegun a pastoral play, and had worked it out in what I felt sure must\r\nbe an entirely unprecedented way.\r\n\r\nI chose Goethe’s Laune der Verliebten as a model for the form and plot\r\nof my work. I scarcely even drafted out the libretto, however, but\r\nworked it out at the same time as the music and orchestration, so that,\r\nwhile I was writing out one page of the score, I had not even thought\r\nout the words for the next page. I remember distinctly that following\r\nthis extraordinary method, although I had not acquired the slightest\r\nknowledge about writing for instruments, I actually worked out a fairly\r\nlong passage which finally resolved itself into a scene for three\r\nfemale voices followed by the air for the tenor. My bent for writing\r\nfor the orchestra was so strong that I procured a score of Don Juan,\r\nand set to work on what I then considered a very careful orchestration\r\nof a fairly long air for soprano. I also wrote a quartette in D major\r\nafter I had myself sufficiently mastered the alto for the viola, my\r\nignorance of which had caused me great difficulty only a short time\r\nbefore, when I was studying a quartette by Haydn.\r\n\r\nArmed with these works, I set out in the summer on my first journey as\r\na musician. My sister Clara, who was married to the singer Wolfram, had\r\nan engagement at the theatre at Magdeburg, whither, in characteristic\r\nfashion, I set forth upon my adventure on foot.\r\n\r\nMy short stay with my relations provided me with many experiences of\r\nmusical life. It was there that I met a new freak, whose influence upon\r\nme I have never been able to forget. He was a musical conductor of the\r\nname of Kuhnlein, a most extraordinary person. Already advanced in\r\nyears, delicate and, unfortunately, given to drink, this man\r\nnevertheless impressed one by something striking and vigorous in his\r\nexpression. His chief characteristics were an enthusiastic worship of\r\nMozart and a passionate depreciation of Weber. He had read only one\r\nbook—Goethe’s Faust—and in this work there was not a page in which he\r\nhad not underlined some passage, and made some remark in praise of\r\nMozart or in disparagement of Weber. It was to this man that my\r\nbrother-in-law confided the compositions which I had brought with me in\r\norder to learn his opinion of my abilities. One evening, as we were\r\nsitting comfortably in an inn, old Kuhnlein came in, and approached us\r\nwith a friendly, though serious manner.\r\n\r\nI thought I read good news in his features, but when my brother-in-law\r\nasked him what he thought of my work, he answered quietly and calmly,\r\n‘There is not a single good note in it!’ My brother-in-law, who was\r\naccustomed to Kuhnlein’s eccentricity, gave a loud laugh which\r\nreassured me somewhat. It was impossible to get any advice or coherent\r\nreasons for his opinion out of Kuhnlein; he merely renewed his abuse of\r\nWeber and made some references to Mozart which, nevertheless, made a\r\ndeep impression upon me, as Kuhnlein’s language was always very heated\r\nand emphatic.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this visit brought me a great treasure, which was\r\nresponsible for leading me in a very different direction from that\r\nadvised by Kuhnlein. This was the score of Beethoven’s great Quartette\r\nin E flat major, which had only been fairly recently published, and of\r\nwhich my brother-in-law had a copy made for me. Richer in experience,\r\nand in the possession of this treasure, I returned to Leipzig to the\r\nnursery of my queer musical studies. But my family had now returned\r\nwith my sister Rosalie, and I could no longer keep secret from them the\r\nfact that my connection with the school had been entirely suspended,\r\nfor a notice was found saying that I had not attended the school for\r\nthe last six months. As a complaint addressed by the rector to my uncle\r\nabout me had not received adequate attention, the school authorities\r\nhad apparently made no further attempts to exercise any supervision\r\nover me, which I had indeed rendered quite impossible by absenting\r\nmyself altogether.\r\n\r\nA fresh council of war was held in the family to discuss what was to be\r\ndone with me. As I laid particular stress on my bent for music, my\r\nrelations thought that I ought, at any rate, to learn one instrument\r\nthoroughly. My brother-in-law, Brockhaus, proposed to send me to\r\nHummel, at Weimar, to be trained as a pianist, but as I loudly\r\nprotested that by ‘music’ I meant ‘composing,’ and not ‘playing an\r\ninstrument,’ they gave way, and decided to let me have regular lessons\r\nin harmony from Muller, the very musician from whom I had had\r\ninstruction on the sly some little while before, and who had not yet\r\nbeen paid. In return for this I promised faithfully to go back to work\r\nconscientiously at St. Nicholas’s School. I soon grew tired of both. I\r\ncould brook no control, and this unfortunately applied to my musical\r\ninstruction as well. The dry study of harmony disgusted me more and\r\nmore, though I continued to conceive fantasias, sonatas, and overtures,\r\nand work them out by myself. On the other hand, I was spurred on by\r\nambition to show what I could do at school if I liked. When the Upper\r\nSchool boys were set the task of writing a poem, I composed a chorus in\r\nGreek, on the recent War of Liberation. I can well imagine that this\r\nGreek poem had about as much resemblance to a real Greek oration and\r\npoetry, as the sonatas and overtures I used to compose at that time had\r\nto thoroughly professional music. My attempt was scornfully rejected as\r\na piece of impudence. After that I have no further recollections of my\r\nschool. My continued attendance was a pure sacrifice on my side, made\r\nout of consideration for my family: I did not pay the slightest\r\nattention to what was taught in the lessons, but secretly occupied\r\nmyself all the while with reading any book that happened to attract me.\r\n\r\nAs my musical instruction also did me no good, I continued in my wilful\r\nprocess of self-education by copying out the scores of my beloved\r\nmasters, and in so doing acquired a neat handwriting, which in later\r\nyears has often been admired. I believe my copies of the C minor\r\nSymphony and the Ninth Symphony by Beethoven are still preserved as\r\nsouvenirs.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s Ninth Symphony became the mystical goal of all my strange\r\nthoughts and desires about music. I was first attracted to it by the\r\nopinion prevalent among musicians, not only in Leipzig but elsewhere,\r\nthat this work had been written by Beethoven when he was already half\r\nmad. It was considered the ‘non plus ultra’ of all that was fantastic\r\nand incomprehensible, and this was quite enough to rouse in me a\r\npassionate desire to study this mysterious work. At the very first\r\nglance at the score, of which I obtained possession with such\r\ndifficulty, I felt irresistibly attracted by the long-sustained pure\r\nfifths with which the first phrase opens: these chords, which, as I\r\nrelated above, had played such a supernatural part in my childish\r\nimpressions of music, seemed in this case to form the spiritual keynote\r\nof my own life. This, I thought, must surely contain the secret of all\r\nsecrets, and accordingly the first thing to be done was to make the\r\nscore my own by a process of laborious copying. I well remember that on\r\none occasion the sudden appearance of the dawn made such an uncanny\r\nimpression on my excited nerves that I jumped into bed with a scream as\r\nthough I had seen a ghost. The symphony at that time had not yet been\r\narranged for the piano; it had found so little favour that the\r\npublisher did not feel inclined to run the risk of producing it. I set\r\nto work at it, and actually composed a complete piano solo, which I\r\ntried to play to myself. I sent my work to Schott, the publisher of the\r\nscore, at Mainz. I received in reply a letter saying ‘that the\r\npublishers had not yet decided to issue the Ninth Symphony for the\r\npiano, but that they would gladly keep my laborious work,’ and offered\r\nme remuneration in the shape of the score of the great Missa Solemnis\r\nin D, which I accepted with great pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this work I practised the violin for some time, as my\r\nharmony master very rightly considered that some knowledge of the\r\npractical working of this instrument was indispensable for any one who\r\nhad the intention of composing for the orchestra. My mother, indeed,\r\npaid the violinist Sipp (who was still playing in the Leipzig orchestra\r\nin 1865) eight thalers for a violin (I do not know what became of it),\r\nwith which for quite three months I must have inflicted unutterable\r\ntorture upon my mother and sister by practising in my tiny little room.\r\nI got so far as to play certain Variations in F sharp by Mayseder, but\r\nonly reached the second or third. After that I have no further\r\nrecollections of this practising, in which my family fortunately had\r\nvery good reasons of their own for not encouraging me.\r\n\r\nBut the time now arrived when my interest in the theatre again took a\r\npassionate hold upon me. A new company had been formed in my birthplace\r\nunder very good auspices. The Board of Management of the Court Theatre\r\nat Dresden had taken over the management of the Leipzig theatre for\r\nthree years. My sister Rosalie was a member of the company, and through\r\nher I could always gain admittance to the performances; and that which\r\nin my childhood had been merely the interest aroused by a strange\r\nspirit of curiosity now became a more deep-seated and conscious\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nJulius Caesar, Macbeth, Hamlet, the plays of Schiller, and to crown\r\nall, Goethe’s Faust, excited and stirred me deeply. The Opera was\r\ngiving the first performances of Marschner’s Vampir and Templer und\r\nJudin. The Italian company arrived from Dresden, and fascinated the\r\nLeipzig audience by their consummate mastery of their art. Even I was\r\nalmost carried away by the enthusiasm with which the town was\r\nover-whelmed, into forgetting the boyish impressions which Signor\r\nSassaroli had stamped upon my mind, when another miracle—which also\r\ncame to us from Dresden—suddenly gave a new direction to my artistic\r\nfeelings and exercised a decisive influence over my whole life. This\r\nconsisted of a special performance given by Wilhelmine\r\nSchroder-Devrient, who at that time was at the zenith of her artistic\r\ncareer, young, beautiful, and ardent, and whose like I have never again\r\nseen on the stage. She made her appearance in Fidelio.\r\n\r\nIf I look back on my life as a whole, I can find no event that produced\r\nso profound an impression upon me. Any one who can remember that\r\nwonderful woman at this period of her life must to some extent have\r\nexperienced the almost Satanic ardour which the intensely human art of\r\nthis incomparable actress poured into his veins. After the performance\r\nI rushed to a friend’s house and wrote a short note to the singer, in\r\nwhich I briefly told her that from that moment my life had acquired its\r\ntrue significance, and that if in days to come she should ever hear my\r\nname praised in the world of Art, she must remember that she had that\r\nevening made me what I then swore it was my destiny to become. This\r\nnote I left at her hotel, and ran out into the night as if I were mad.\r\nIn the year 1842, when I went to Dresden to make my debut with Rienzi,\r\nI paid several visits to the kind-hearted singer, who startled me on\r\none occasion by repeating this letter word for word. It seemed to have\r\nmade an impression on her too, as she had actually kept it.\r\n\r\nAt this point I feel myself obliged to acknowledge that the great\r\nconfusion which now began to prevail in my life, and particularly in my\r\nstudies, was due to the inordinate effect this artistic interpretation\r\nhad upon me. I did not know where to turn, or how to set about\r\nproducing something myself which might place me in direct contact with\r\nthe impression I had received, while everything that could not be\r\nbrought into touch with it seemed to me so shallow and meaningless that\r\nI could not possibly trouble myself with it. I should have liked to\r\ncompose a work worthy of a Schroder-Devrient; but as this was quite\r\nbeyond my power, in my head-long despair I let all artistic endeavour\r\nslide, and as my work was also utterly insufficient to absorb me, I\r\nflung myself recklessly into the life of the moment in the company of\r\nstrangely chosen associates, and indulged in all kinds of youthful\r\nexcesses.\r\n\r\nI now entered into all the dissipations of raw manhood, the outward\r\nugliness and inward emptiness of which make me marvel to this day. My\r\nintercourse with those of my own age had always been the result of pure\r\nchance. I cannot remember that any special inclination or attraction\r\ndetermined me in the choice of my young friends. While I can honestly\r\nsay that I was never in a position to stand aloof out of envy from any\r\none who was specially gifted, I can only explain my indifference in the\r\nchoice of my associates by the fact that through inexperience regarding\r\nthe sort of companionship that would be of advantage to me, I cared\r\nonly to have some one who would accompany me in my excursions, and to\r\nwhom I could pour out my feelings to my heart’s content without caring\r\nwhat effect it might have upon him. The result of this was that after a\r\nstream of confidences to which my own excitement was the only response,\r\nI at length reached the point when I turned and looked at my friend; to\r\nmy astonishment I generally found that there was no question of\r\nresponse at all, and as soon as I set my heart on drawing something\r\nfrom him in return, and urged him to confide in me, when he really had\r\nnothing to tell, the connection usually came to an end and left no\r\ntrace on my life. In a certain sense my strange relationship with\r\nFlachs was typical of the great majority of my ties in after-life.\r\nConsequently, as no lasting personal bond of friendship ever found its\r\nway into my life, it is easy to understand how delight in the\r\ndissipations of student life could become a passion of some duration,\r\nbecause in it individual intercourse is entirely replaced by a common\r\ncircle of acquaintances. In the midst of rowdyism and ragging of the\r\nmost foolish description, I remained quite alone, and it is quite\r\npossible that these frivolities formed a protecting hedge round my\r\ninmost soul, which needed time to grow to its natural strength and not\r\nbe weakened by reaching maturity too soon.\r\n\r\nMy life seemed to break up in all directions; I had to leave St.\r\nNicholas’s School at Easter 1830, as I was too deeply in disgrace with\r\nthe staff of masters ever to hope for any promotion in the University\r\nfrom that quarter. It was now determined that I should study privately\r\nfor six months and then go to St. Thomas’s School, where I should be in\r\nfresh surroundings and be able to work up and qualify in a short time\r\nfor the University. My uncle Adolph, with whom I was constantly\r\nrenewing my friendship, and who also encouraged me about my music and\r\nexercised a good influence over me in that respect, in spite of the\r\nutter degradation of my life at that time, kept arousing in me an ever\r\nfresh desire for scientific studies. I took private lessons in Greek\r\nfrom a scholar, and read Sophocles with him. For a time I hoped this\r\nnoble poet would again inspire me to get a real hold on the language,\r\nbut the hope was vain. I had not chosen the right teacher, and,\r\nmoreover, his sitting-room in which we pursued our studies looked out\r\non a tanyard, the repulsive odour of which affected my nerves so\r\nstrongly that I became thoroughly disgusted both with Sophocles and\r\nGreek. My brother-in-law, Brockhaus, who wanted to put me in the way of\r\nearning some pocket-money, gave me the correcting of the proof-sheets\r\nof a new edition he was bringing out of Becker’s Universal History,\r\nrevised by Lobell. This gave me a reason for improving by private study\r\nthe superficial general instruction on every subject which is given at\r\nschool, and I thus acquired the valuable knowledge which I was destined\r\nto have in later life of most of the branches of learning so\r\nuninterestingly taught in class. I must not forget to mention that, to\r\na certain extent, the attraction exercised over me by this first closer\r\nstudy of history was due to the fact that it brought me in eightpence a\r\nsheet, and I thus found myself in one of the rarest positions in my\r\nlife, actually earning money; yet I should be doing myself an injustice\r\nif I did not bear in mind the vivid impressions I now for the first\r\ntime received upon turning my serious attention to those periods of\r\nhistory with which I had hitherto had a very superficial acquaintance.\r\nAll I recollect about my school days in this connection is that I was\r\nattracted by the classical period of Greek history; Marathon, Salamis,\r\nand Thermopylae composed the canon of all that interested me in the\r\nsubject. Now for the first time I made an intimate acquaintance with\r\nthe Middle Ages and the French Revolution, as my work in correcting\r\ndealt precisely with the two volumes which contained these two periods.\r\nI remember in particular that the description of the Revolution filled\r\nme with sincere hatred for its heroes; unfamiliar as I was with the\r\nprevious history of France, my human sympathy was horrified by the\r\ncruelty of the men of that day, and this purely human impulse remained\r\nso strong in me that I remember how even quite recently it cost me a\r\nreal struggle to give any weight to the true political significance of\r\nthose acts of violence.\r\n\r\nHow great, then, was my astonishment when one day the current political\r\nevents of the time enabled me, as it were, to gain a personal\r\nexperience of the sort of national upheavals with which I had come into\r\ndistant contact in the course of my proof-correcting. The special\r\neditions of the Leipzig Gazette brought us the news of the July\r\nRevolution in Paris. The King of France had been driven from his\r\nthrone; Lafayette, who a moment before had seemed a myth to me, was\r\nagain riding through a cheering crowd in the streets of Paris; the\r\nSwiss Guards had once more been butchered in the Tuileries, and a new\r\nKing knew no better way of commending himself to the populace than by\r\ndeclaring himself the embodiment of the Republic. Suddenly to become\r\nconscious of living at a time in which such things took place could not\r\nfail to have a startling effect on a boy of seventeen. The world as a\r\nhistoric phenomenon began from that day in my eyes, and naturally my\r\nsympathies were wholly on the side of the Revolution, which I regarded\r\nin the light of a heroic popular struggle crowned with victory, and\r\nfree from the blemish of the terrible excesses that stained the first\r\nFrench Revolution. As the whole of Europe, including some of the German\r\nstates, was soon plunged more or less violently into rebellion, I\r\nremained for some time in a feverish state of suspense, and now first\r\nturned my attention to the causes of these upheavals, which I regarded\r\nas struggles of the young and hopeful against the old and effete\r\nportion of mankind. Saxony also did not remain unscathed; in Dresden it\r\ncame to actual fighting in the streets, which immediately produced a\r\npolitical change in the shape of the proclamation of the regency of the\r\nfuture King Frederick, and the granting of a constitution. This event\r\nfilled me with such enthusiasm that I composed a political overture,\r\nthe prelude of which depicted dark oppression in the midst of which a\r\nstrain was at last heard under which, to make my meaning clearer, I\r\nwrote the words Friedrich und Freiheil; this strain was intended to\r\ndevelop gradually and majestically into the fullest triumph, which I\r\nhoped shortly to see successfully performed at one of the Leipzig\r\nGarden Concerts.\r\n\r\nHowever, before I was able to develop my politico-musical conceptions\r\nfurther, disorders broke out in Leipzig itself which summoned me from\r\nthe precincts of Art to take a direct share in national life. National\r\nlife in Leipzig at this time meant nothing more than antagonism between\r\nthe students and the police, the latter being the arch-enemy upon whom\r\nthe youthful love of liberty vented itself. Some students had been\r\narrested in a street broil who were now to be rescued. The\r\nunder-graduates, who had been restless for some days, assembled one\r\nevening in the Market Place and the Clubs, mustered together, and made\r\na ring round their leaders. The whole proceeding was marked by a\r\ncertain measured solemnity, which impressed me deeply. They sang\r\nGaudeamus igitur, formed up into column, and picking up from the crowd\r\nany young men who sympathised with them, marched gravely and resolutely\r\nfrom the Market Place to the University buildings, to open the cells\r\nand set free the students who had been arrested. My heart beat fast as\r\nI marched with them to this ‘Taking of the Bastille,’ but things did\r\nnot turn out as we expected, for in the courtyard of the Paulinum the\r\nsolemn procession was stopped by Rector Krug, who had come down to meet\r\nit with his grey head bared; his assurance that the captives had\r\nalready been released at his request was greeted with a thundering\r\ncheer, and the matter seemed at an end.\r\n\r\nBut the tense expectation of a revolution had grown too great not to\r\ndemand some sacrifice. A summons was suddenly spread calling us to a\r\nnotorious alley in order to exercise popular justice upon a hated\r\nmagistrate who, it was rumoured, had unlawfully taken under his\r\nprotection a certain house of ill-fame in that quarter. When I reached\r\nthe spot with the tail-end of the crowd, I found the house had been\r\nbroken into and all sorts of violence had been committed. I recall with\r\nhorror the intoxicating effect this unreasoning fury had upon me, and\r\ncannot deny that without the slightest personal provocation I shared,\r\nlike one possessed, in the frantic onslaught of the undergraduates, who\r\nmadly shattered furniture and crockery to bits. I do not believe that\r\nthe ostensible motive for this outrage, which, it is true, was to be\r\nfound in a fact that was a grave menace to public morality, had any\r\nweight with me whatever; on the contrary, it was the purely devilish\r\nfury of these popular outbursts that drew me, too, like a madman into\r\ntheir vortex.\r\n\r\nThe fact that such fits of fury are not quick to abate, but, in\r\naccordance with certain natural laws, reach their proper conclusion\r\nonly after they have degenerated into frenzy, I was to learn in my own\r\nperson. Scarcely did the summons ring out for us to march to another\r\nresort of the same kind than I too found myself in the tide which set\r\ntowards the opposite end of the town. There the same exploits were\r\nrepeated, and the most ludicrous outrages perpetrated. I cannot\r\nremember that the enjoyment of alcoholic drinks contributed to the\r\nintoxication of myself and my immediate fellows. I only know that I\r\nfinally got into the state that usually succeeds a debauch, and upon\r\nwaking next morning, as if from a hideous nightmare, had to convince\r\nmyself that I had really taken part in the events of the previous night\r\nby a trophy I possessed in the shape of a tattered red curtain, which I\r\nhad brought home as a token of my prowess. The thought that people\r\ngenerally, and my own family in particular, were wont to put a lenient\r\nconstruction upon youthful escapades was a great comfort to me;\r\noutbursts of this kind on the part of the young were regarded as\r\nrighteous indignation against really serious scandals, and there was no\r\nneed for me to be afraid of owning up to having taken part in such\r\nexcesses.\r\n\r\nThe dangerous example, however, which had been set by the\r\nundergraduates incited the lower classes and the mob to similar\r\nexcesses on the following nights, against employers and any who were\r\nobnoxious to them. The matter at once assumed a more serious\r\ncomplexion; property was threatened, and a conflict between rich and\r\npoor stood grinning at our doors. As there were no soldiers in the\r\ntown, and the police were thoroughly disorganised, the students were\r\ncalled in as a protection against the lower orders. An undergraduate’s\r\nhour of glory now began, such as I could only have thirsted for in my\r\nschoolboy dreams. The student became the tutelar deity of Leipzig,\r\ncalled on by the authorities to arm and band together in defence of\r\nproperty, and the same young men who two days before had yielded to a\r\nrage for destruction, now mustered in the University courtyard. The\r\nproscribed names of the students’ clubs and unions were shouted by the\r\nmouths of town councillors and chief constables in order to summon\r\ncuriously equipped undergraduates, who thereupon, in simple mediaeval\r\narray of war, scattered throughout the town, occupied the guard-rooms\r\nat the gates, provided sentinels for the grounds of various wealthy\r\nmerchants, and, as occasion demanded, took places which seemed\r\nthreatened, more especially inns, under their permanent protection.\r\n\r\nThough, unluckily, I was not yet a member of their body, I anticipated\r\nthe delights of academic citizenship by half-impudent, half-obsequious\r\nsolicitation of the leaders of the students whom I honoured most. I had\r\nthe good fortune to recommend myself particularly to these ‘cocks of\r\nthe walk,’ as they were styled, on account of my relationship to\r\nBrockhaus, in whose grounds the main body of these champions were\r\nencamped for some time. My brother-in-law was among those who had been\r\nseriously threatened, and it was only owing to really great presence of\r\nmind and assurance that he succeeded in saving his printing works, and\r\nespecially his steam presses, which were the chief object of attack,\r\nfrom destruction. To protect his property against further assault,\r\ndetachments of students were told off to his grounds as well; the\r\nexcellent entertainment which the generous master of the house offered\r\nhis jovial guardians in his pleasant summer-house enticed the pick of\r\nthe students to him. My brother-in-law was for several weeks guarded\r\nday and night against possible attacks by the populace, and on this\r\noccasion, as the mediator of a flowing hospitality, I celebrated among\r\nthe most famous ‘bloods’ of the University the true saturnalia of my\r\nscholarly ambition.\r\n\r\nFor a still longer period the guarding of the gates was entrusted to\r\nthe students; the unheard-of splendour which accordingly became\r\nassociated with this post drew fresh aspirants to the spot from far and\r\nnear. Every day huge chartered vehicles discharged at the Halle Gate\r\nwhole bands of the boldest sons of learning from Halle, Jena,\r\nGottingen, and the remotest regions. They got down close to the guards\r\nat the gate, and for several weeks never set foot in an inn or any\r\nother dwelling; they lived at the expense of the Council, drew vouchers\r\non the police for food and drink, and knew but one care, that the\r\npossibility of a general quieting of men’s minds would make their\r\nopportune guardianship superfluous. I never missed a day on guard or a\r\nnight either, alas! trying to impress on my family the urgent need for\r\nmy personal endurance. Of course, the quieter and really studious\r\nspirits among us soon resigned these duties, and only the flower of the\r\nflock of undergraduates remained so staunch that it became difficult\r\nfor the authorities to relieve them of their task. I held out to the\r\nvery last, and succeeded in making most astonishing friends for my age.\r\nMany of the most audacious remained in Leipzig even when there was no\r\nguard duty to fulfil, and peopled the place for some time with\r\nchampions of an extraordinarily desperate and dissipated type, who had\r\nbeen repeatedly sent down from various universities for rowdyism or\r\ndebt, and who now, thanks to the exceptional circumstances of the day,\r\nfound a refuge in Leipzig, where at first they had been received with\r\nopen arms by the general enthusiasm of their comrades.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of all these phenomena I felt as if I were surrounded\r\nby the results of an earthquake which had upset the usual order of\r\nthings. My brother-in-law, Friedrich Brockhaus, who could justly taunt\r\nthe former authorities of the place with their inability to maintain\r\npeace and order, was carried away by the current of a formidable\r\nmovement of opposition. He made a daring speech at the Guildhall before\r\ntheir worships the Town Council, which brought him popularity, and he\r\nwas appointed second-in-command of the newly constituted Leipzig\r\nMunicipal Guard. This body at length ousted my adored students from the\r\nguard-rooms of the town gates, and we no longer had the right of\r\nstopping travellers and inspecting their passes. On the other hand, I\r\nflattered myself that I might regard my new position as a boy citizen\r\nas equivalent to that of the French National Guard, and my\r\nbrother-in-law, Brockhaus, as a Saxon Lafayette, which, at all events,\r\nsucceeded in furnishing my soaring excitement with a healthy stimulant.\r\nI now began to read the papers and cultivate politics enthusiastically;\r\nhowever, the social intercourse of the civic world did not attract me\r\nsufficiently to make me false to my beloved academic associates. I\r\nfollowed them faithfully from the guard-rooms to the ordinary bars,\r\nwhere their splendour as men of the literary world now sought\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\nMy chief ambition was to become one of them as soon as possible. This,\r\nhowever, could only be accomplished by being again entered at a grammar\r\nschool. St. Thomas’s, whose headmaster was a feeble old man, was the\r\nplace where my wishes could be most speedily attained.\r\n\r\nI joined the school in the autumn of 1830 simply with the intention of\r\nqualifying myself for the Leaving Examination by merely nominal\r\nattendance there. The chief thing in connection with it was that I and\r\nfriends of the same bent succeeded in establishing a sham students’\r\nassociation called the Freshman’s Club. It was formed with all possible\r\npedantry, the institution of the ‘Comment’ was introduced,\r\nfencing-practice and sword-bouts were held, and an inaugural meeting to\r\nwhich several prominent students were invited, and at which I presided\r\nas ‘Vice’ in white buckskin trousers and great jack-boots, gave me a\r\nforetaste of the delights awaiting me as a full-blown son of the Muses.\r\n\r\nThe masters of St. Thomas’s, however, were not quite so ready to fall\r\nin with my aspirations to studentship; at the end of the half-year they\r\nwere of the opinion that I had not given a thought to their\r\ninstitution, and nothing could persuade them that I had earned a title\r\nto academic citizenship by any acquisition of knowledge. Some sort of\r\ndecision was necessary, so I accordingly informed my family that I had\r\nmade up my mind not to study for a profession at the University, but to\r\nbecome a musician. There was nothing to prevent me matriculating as\r\n‘Studiosus Musicae,’ and, without therefore troubling myself about the\r\npedantries of the authorities at St. Thomas’s, I defiantly quitted that\r\nseat of learning from which I had derived small profit, and presented\r\nmyself forthwith to the rector of the University, whose acquaintance I\r\nhad made on the evening of the riot, to be enrolled as a student of\r\nmusic. This was accordingly done without further ado, on the payment of\r\nthe usual fees.\r\n\r\nI was in a great hurry about it, for in a week the Easter vacation\r\nwould begin, and the ‘men’ would go down from Leipzig, when it would be\r\nimpossible to be elected member of a club until the vacation was over,\r\nand to stay all those weeks at home in Leipzig without having the right\r\nto wear the coveted colours seemed to me unendurable torture. Straight\r\nfrom the rector’s presence I ran like a wounded animal to the fencing\r\nschool, to present myself for admission to the Saxon Club, showing my\r\ncard of matriculation. I attained my object, I could wear the colours\r\nof the Saxonia, which was in the fashion at that time, and in great\r\nrequest because it numbered so many delightful members in its ranks.\r\n\r\nThe strangest fate was to befall me in this Easter vacation, during\r\nwhich I was really the only remaining representative of the Saxon Club\r\nin Leipzig. In the beginning this club consisted chiefly of men of good\r\nfamily as well as the better class elements of the student world; all\r\nof them were members of highly placed and well-to-do families in Saxony\r\nin general, and in particular from the capital, Dresden, and spent\r\ntheir vacation at their respective homes. There remained in Leipzig\r\nduring the vacations only those wandering students who had no homes,\r\nand for whom in reality it was always or never holiday time. Among\r\nthose a separate club had arisen of daring and desperate young\r\nreprobates who had found a last refuge, as I said, at Leipzig in the\r\nglorious period I have recorded. I had already made the personal\r\nacquaintance of these swashbucklers, who pleased my fancy greatly, when\r\nthey were guarding the Brockhaus grounds. Although the regular duration\r\nof a university course did not exceed three years, most of these men\r\nhad never left their universities for six or seven years.\r\n\r\nI was particularly fascinated by a man called Gebhardt, who was endowed\r\nwith extraordinary physical beauty and strength, and whose slim heroic\r\nfigure towered head and shoulders above all his companions. When he\r\nwalked down the street arm-in-arm with two of the strongest of his\r\ncomrades, he used suddenly to take it into his head, by an easy\r\nmovement of his arm, to lift his friends high in the air and flutter\r\nalong in this way as though he had a pair of human wings. When a cab\r\nwas going along the streets at a sharp trot, he would seize a spoke of\r\nthe wheel with one hand and force it to pull up. Nobody ever told him\r\nthat he was stupid because they were afraid of his strength, hence his\r\nlimitations were scarcely noticed. His redoubtable strength, combined\r\nwith a temperate disposition, lent him a majestic dignity which placed\r\nhim above the level of an ordinary mortal. He had come to Leipzig from\r\nMecklenburg in the company of a certain Degelow, who was as powerful\r\nand adroit, though by no means of such gigantic proportions, as his\r\nfriend, and whose chief attraction lay in his great vivacity and\r\nanimated features, he had led a wild and dissipated life in which play,\r\ndrink, passionate love affairs, and constant and prompt duelling had\r\nrung the changes. Ceremonious politeness, an ironic and pedantic\r\ncoldness, which testified to bold self-confidence, combined with a very\r\nhot temper, formed the chief characteristics of this personage and\r\nnatures akin to his. Degelow’s wildness and passion were lent a curious\r\ndiabolical charm by the possession of a malicious humour which he often\r\nturned against himself, whereas towards others he exercised a certain\r\nchivalrous tenderness.\r\n\r\nThese two extraordinary men were joined by others who possessed all the\r\nqualities essential to a reckless life, together with real and\r\nheadstrong valour. One of them, named Stelzer, a regular Berserker out\r\nof the Nibelungenlied, who was nick-named Lope, was in his twentieth\r\nterm. While these men openly and consciously belonged to a world doomed\r\nto destruction, and all their actions and escapades could only be\r\nexplained by the hypothesis that they all believed that inevitable ruin\r\nwas imminent, I made in their company the acquaintance of a certain\r\nSchroter, who particularly attracted me by his cordial disposition,\r\npleasant Hanoverian accent, and refined wit. He was not one of the\r\nregular young dare-devils, towards whom he adopted a calm observant\r\nattitude, while they were all fond of him and glad to see him. I made a\r\nreal friend of this Schroter, although he was much older than I was.\r\nThrough him I became acquainted with the works and poems of H. Heine,\r\nand from him I acquired a certain neat and saucy wit, and I was quite\r\nready to surrender myself to his agreeable influence in the hope of\r\nimproving my outward bearing. It was his company in particular that I\r\nsought every day; in the afternoon I generally met him in the Rosenthal\r\nor Kintschy’s Chalet, though always in the presence of those wonderful\r\nGoths who excited at once my alarm and admiration.\r\n\r\nThey all belonged to university clubs which were on hostile terms with\r\nthe one of which I was a member. What this hostility between the\r\nvarious clubs meant only those can judge who are familiar with the tone\r\nprevalent among them in those days. The mere sight of hostile colours\r\nsufficed to infuriate these men, who otherwise were kind and gentle,\r\nprovided they had taken the slightest drop too much. At all events, as\r\nlong as the old stagers were sober they would look with good-natured\r\ncomplacency at a slight young fellow like me in the hostile colours\r\nmoving among them so amicably. Those colours I wore in my own peculiar\r\nfashion. I had made use of the brief week during which my club was\r\nstill in Leipzig to become the possessor of a splendid ‘Saxon’ cap,\r\nrichly embroidered with silver, and worn by a man called Muller, who\r\nwas afterwards a prominent constable at Dresden. I had been seized with\r\nsuch a violent craving for this cap that I managed to buy it from him,\r\nas he wanted money to go home. In spite of this remarkable cap I was,\r\nas I have said, welcome in the den of this band of rowdies: my friend\r\nSchroter saw to that. It was only when the grog, which was the\r\nprincipal beverage of these wild spirits, began to work that I used to\r\nnotice curious glances and overhear doubtful speeches, the significance\r\nof which was for some time hidden from me by the dizziness in which my\r\nown senses were plunged by this baneful drink.\r\n\r\nAs I was inevitably bound on this account to be mixed up in quarrels\r\nfor some time to come, it afforded me a great satisfaction that my\r\nfirst fight, as a matter of fact, arose from an incident more\r\ncreditable to me than those provocations which I had left half\r\nunnoticed. One day Degelow came up to Schroter and me in a wine-bar\r\nthat we often frequented, and in quite a friendly manner confessed to\r\nus confidentially his liking for a young and very pretty actress whose\r\ntalent Schroter disputed. Degelow rejoined that this was as it might\r\nbe, but that, for his part, he regarded the young lady as the most\r\nrespectable woman in the theatre. I at once asked him if he considered\r\nmy sister’s reputation was not as good. According to students’ notions\r\nit was impossible for Degelow, who doubtless had not the remotest\r\nintention of being insulting, to give me any assurance further than to\r\nsay that he certainly did not think my sister had an inferior\r\nreputation, but that, nevertheless, he meant to abide by his assertion\r\nconcerning the young lady he had mentioned. Hereupon followed without\r\ndelay the usual challenge, opening with the words, ‘You’re an ass,’\r\nwhich sounded almost ridiculous to my own ears when I said them to this\r\nseasoned swashbuckler.\r\n\r\nI remember that Degelow too gasped with astonishment, and lightning\r\nseemed to flash from his eyes; but he controlled himself in the\r\npresence of my friend, and proceeded to observe the usual formalities\r\nof a challenge, and chose broadswords (krumme Sabel) as the weapons for\r\nthe fight. The event made a great stir among our companions, but I saw\r\nless reason than before to abstain from my usual intercourse with them.\r\nOnly I became more strict about the behaviour of the swashbucklers, and\r\nfor several days no evening passed without producing a challenge\r\nbetween me and some formidable bully, until at last Count Solms, the\r\nonly member of my club who had returned to Leipzig as yet, visited me\r\nas though he were an intimate friend and inquired into what had\r\noccurred. He applauded my conduct, but advised me not to wear my\r\ncolours until the return of our comrades from the vacation, and to keep\r\naway from the bad company into which I had ventured. Fortunately I had\r\nnot long to wait; university life soon began again, and the fencing\r\nground was filled. The unenviable position, in which, in student\r\nphrase, I was suspended with a half-dozen of the most terrible\r\nswordsmen, earned me a glorious reputation among the ‘freshmen’ and\r\n‘juniors,’ and even among the older ‘champions’ of the Saxonia.\r\n\r\nMy seconds were duly arranged, the dates for the various duels on hand\r\nsettled, and by the care of my seniors the needful time was secured for\r\nme to acquire some sort of skill in fencing. The light heart with which\r\nI awaited the fate which threatened me in at least one of the impending\r\nencounters I myself could not understand at the time; on the other\r\nhand, the way in which that fate preserved me from the consequences of\r\nmy rashness seems truly miraculous in my eyes to this day, and, worthy\r\nof further description.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for a duel included obtaining some experience of these\r\nencounters by being present at several of them. We freshmen attained\r\nthis object by what is called ‘carrying duty,’ that is to say, we were\r\nentrusted with the rapiers of the corps (precious weapons of honour\r\nbelonging to the association), and had to take them first to the\r\ngrinder and thence to the scene of encounter, a proceeding which was\r\nattended with some danger, as it had to be done surreptitiously, since\r\nduelling was forbidden by law; in return we acquired the right of\r\nassisting as spectators at the impending engagements.\r\n\r\nWhen I had earned this honour, the meeting-place chosen for the duel I\r\nwas to watch was the billiard-room of an inn in the Burgstrasse; the\r\ntable had been moved to one side, and on it the authorised spectators\r\ntook their places. Among them I stood up with a beating heart to watch\r\nthe dangerous encounters between those doughty champions. I was told on\r\nthis occasion of the story of one of my friends (a Jew named Levy, but\r\nknown as Lippert), who on this very floor had given so much ground\r\nbefore his antagonist that the door had to be opened for him, and he\r\nfell back through it down the steps into the street, still believing he\r\nwas engaged in the duel. When several bouts had been finished, two men\r\ncame on to the ‘pitch,’ Tempel, the president of the Markomanen, and a\r\ncertain Wohlfart, an old stager, already in his fourteenth half-year of\r\nstudy, with whom I also was booked for an encounter later on. When this\r\nwas the case, a man was not allowed to watch, in order that the weak\r\npoints of the duellist might not be betrayed to his future opponent.\r\nWohlfart was accordingly asked by my chiefs whether he wanted me\r\nremoved; whereupon he replied with calm contempt, ‘Let them leave the\r\nlittle freshman there, in God’s name!’ Thus I became an eye-witness of\r\nthe disablement of a swordsman who nevertheless showed himself so\r\nexperienced and skilful on the occasion that I might well have become\r\nalarmed for the issue of my future encounter with him. His gigantic\r\nopponent cut the artery of his right arm, which at once ended the\r\nfight; the surgeon declared that Wohlfart would not be able to hold a\r\nsword again for years, under which circumstances my proposed meeting\r\nwith him was at once cancelled. I do not deny that this incident\r\ncheered my soul.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the first general reunion of our club was held at\r\nthe Green Tap. These gatherings are regular hot-beds for the production\r\nof duels. Here I brought upon myself a new encounter with one Tischer,\r\nbut learned at the same time that I had been relieved of two of my most\r\nformidable previous engagements of the kind by the disappearance of my\r\nopponents, both of whom had escaped on account of debt and left no\r\ntrace behind them. The only one of whom I could hear anything was the\r\nterrible Stelzer, surnamed Lope. This fellow had taken advantage of the\r\npassing of Polish refugees, who had at that time already been driven\r\nover the frontier and were making their way through Germany to France,\r\nto disguise himself as an ill-starred champion of freedom, and he\r\nsubsequently found his way to the Foreign Legion in Algeria. On the way\r\nhome from the gathering, Degelow, whom I was to meet in a few weeks,\r\nproposed a ‘truce.’ This was a device which, if it was accepted, as it\r\nwas in this case, enabled the future combatants to entertain and talk\r\nto one another, which was otherwise most strictly forbidden. We\r\nwandered back to the town arm-in-arm; with chivalrous tenderness my\r\ninteresting and formidable opponent declared that he was delighted at\r\nthe prospect of crossing swords with me in a few weeks’ time; that he\r\nregarded it as an honour and a pleasure, as he was fond of me and\r\nrespected me for my valorous conduct. Seldom has any personal success\r\nflattered me more. We embraced, and amid protestations which, owing to\r\na certain dignity about them, acquired a significance I can never\r\nforget, we parted. He informed me that he must first pay a visit to\r\nJena, where he had an appointment to fight a duel. A week later the\r\nnews of his death reached Leipzig; he had been mortally wounded in the\r\nduel at Jena.\r\n\r\nI felt as if I were living in a dream, out of which I was aroused by\r\nthe announcement of my encounter with Tischer. Though he was a\r\nfirst-rate and vigorous fighter, he had been chosen by our chiefs for\r\nmy first passage of arms because he was fairly short. In spite of being\r\nunable to feel any great confidence in my hastily acquired and little\r\npractised skill in fencing, I looked forward to this my first duel with\r\na light heart. Although it was against the rules, I never dreamed of\r\ntelling the authorities that I was suffering from a slight rash which I\r\nhad caught at that time, and which I was informed made wounds so\r\ndangerous that if it were reported it would postpone the meeting, in\r\nspite of the fact that I was modest enough to be prepared for wounds. I\r\nwas sent for at ten in the morning, and left home smiling to think what\r\nmy mother and sisters would say if in a few hours I were brought back\r\nin the alarming state I anticipated. My chief, Herr v. Schonfeld, was a\r\npleasant, quiet sort of man, who lived on the marsh. When I reached his\r\nhouse, he leant out of the window with his pipe in his mouth, and\r\ngreeted me with the words: ‘You can go home, my lad, it is all off;\r\nTischer is in hospital.’ When I got upstairs I found several ‘leading\r\nmen’ assembled, from whom I learned that Tischer had got very drunk the\r\nnight before, and had in consequence laid himself open to the most\r\noutrageous treatment by the inhabitants of a house of ill-fame. He was\r\nterribly hurt, and had been taken by the police in the first instance\r\nto the hospital. This inevitably meant rustication, and, above all,\r\nexpulsion from the academic association to which he belonged.\r\n\r\nI cannot clearly recall the incidents that removed from Leipzig the few\r\nremaining fire-eaters to whom I had pledged myself since that fatal\r\nvacation-time; I only know that this aide of my fame as a student\r\nyielded to another. We celebrated the ‘freshmen’s gathering,’ to which\r\nall those who could manage it drove a four-in-hand in a long procession\r\nthrough the town. After the president of the club had profoundly moved\r\nme with his sudden and yet prolonged solemnity, I conceived the desire\r\nto be among the very last to return home from the outing. Accordingly I\r\nstayed away three days and three nights, and spent the time chiefly in\r\ngambling, a pastime which from the first night of our festivity cast\r\nits devilish snares around me. Some half-dozen of the smartest club\r\nmembers chanced to be together at early dawn in the Jolly Peasant, and\r\nforthwith formed the nucleus of a gambling club, which was reinforced\r\nduring the day by recruits coming back from the town. Members came to\r\nsee whether we were still at it, members also went away, but I with the\r\noriginal six held out for days and nights without faltering.\r\n\r\nThe desire that first prompted me to take part in the play was the wish\r\nto win enough for my score (two thalers): this I succeeded in doing,\r\nand thereupon I was inspired with the hope of being able to settle all\r\nthe debts I had made at that time by my winnings at play. Just as I had\r\nhoped to learn composition most quickly by Logier’s method, but had\r\nfound myself hampered in my object for a long period by unexpected\r\ndifficulties, so my plan for speedily improving my financial position\r\nwas likewise doomed to disappointment. To win was not such an easy\r\nmatter, and for some three months I was such a victim to the rage for\r\ngambling that no other passion was able to exercise the slightest\r\ninfluence over my mind.\r\n\r\nNeither the Fechtboden (where the students’ fights were practised), nor\r\nthe beer-house, nor the actual scene of the fights, ever saw my face\r\nagain. In my lamentable position I racked my brains all day to devise\r\nways and means of getting the money wherewith to gamble at night. In\r\nvain did my poor mother try everything in her power to induce me not to\r\ncome home so late at night, although she had no idea of the real nature\r\nof my debauches: after I had left the house in the afternoon I never\r\nreturned till dawn the next day, and I reached my room (which was at\r\nsome distance from the others) by climbing over the gate, for my mother\r\nhad refused to give me a latch-key.\r\n\r\nIn despair over my ill-luck, my passion for gambling grew into a\r\nveritable mania, and I no longer felt any inclination for those things\r\nwhich at one time had lured me to student life. I became absolutely\r\nindifferent to the opinion of my former companions and avoided them\r\nentirely; I now lost myself in the smaller gambling dens of Leipzig,\r\nwhere only the very scum of the students congregated. Insensible to any\r\nfeeling of self-respect, I bore even the contempt of my sister Rosalie;\r\nboth she and my mother hardly ever deigning to cast a glance at the\r\nyoung libertine whom they only saw at rare intervals, looking deadly\r\npale and worn out: my ever-growing despair made me at last resort to\r\nfoolhardiness as the only means of forcing hostile fate to my side. It\r\nsuddenly struck me that only by dint of big stakes could I make big\r\nprofits. To this end I decided to make use of my mother’s pension, of\r\nwhich I was trustee of a fairly large sum. That night I lost everything\r\nI had with me except one thaler: the excitement with which I staked\r\nthat last coin on a card was an experience hitherto quite strange to my\r\nyoung life. As I had had nothing to eat, I was obliged repeatedly to\r\nleave the gambling table owing to sickness. With this last thaler I\r\nstaked my life, for my return to my home was, of course, out of the\r\nquestion. Already I saw myself in the grey dawn, a prodigal son,\r\nfleeing from all I held dear, through forest and field towards the\r\nunknown. My mood of despair had gained so strong a hold upon me that,\r\nwhen my card won, I immediately placed all the money on a fresh stake,\r\nand repeated this experiment until I had won quite a considerable\r\namount. From that moment my luck grew continuously. I gained such\r\nconfidence that I risked the most hazardous stakes: for suddenly it\r\ndawned upon me that this was destined to be my last day with the cards.\r\nMy good fortune now became so obvious that the bank thought it wise to\r\nclose. Not only had I won back all the money I had lost, but I had won\r\nenough to pay off all my debts as well. My sensations during the whole\r\nof this process were of the most sacred nature: I felt as if God and\r\nHis angels were standing by my side and were whispering words of\r\nwarning and of consolation into my ears.\r\n\r\nOnce more I climbed over the gate of my home in the early hours of the\r\nmorning, this time to sleep peacefully and soundly and to awake very\r\nlate, strengthened and as though born again.\r\n\r\nNo sense of shame deterred me from telling my mother, to whom I\r\npresented her money, the whole truth about this decisive night. I\r\nvoluntarily confessed my sin in having utilised her pension, sparing no\r\ndetail. She folded her hands and thanked God for His mercy, and\r\nforthwith regarded me as saved, believing it impossible for me ever to\r\ncommit such a crime again.\r\n\r\nAnd, truth to tell, gambling had lost all fascination for me from that\r\nmoment. The world, in which I had moved like one demented, suddenly\r\nseemed stripped of all interest or attraction. My rage for gambling had\r\nalready made me quite indifferent to the usual student’s vanities, and\r\nwhen I was freed from this passion also, I suddenly found myself face\r\nto face with an entirely new world.\r\n\r\nTo this world I belonged henceforth: it was the world of real and\r\nserious musical study, to which I now devoted myself heart and soul.\r\n\r\nEven during this wild period of my life, my musical development had not\r\nbeen entirely at a standstill; on the contrary, it daily became plainer\r\nthat music was the only direction towards which my mental tendencies\r\nhad a marked bent. Only I had got quite out of the habit of musical\r\nstudy. Even now it seems incredible that I managed to find time in\r\nthose days to finish quite a substantial amount of composition. I have\r\nbut the faintest recollection of an Overture in C major (6/8 time), and\r\nof a Sonata in B flat major arranged as a duet; the latter pleased my\r\nsister Ottilie, who played it with me, so much that I arranged it for\r\norchestra. But another work of this period, an Overture in B flat\r\nmajor, left an indelible impression on my mind on account of an\r\nincident connected with it. This composition, in fact, was the outcome\r\nof my study of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony in about the same degree as\r\nLeubald und Adelaïde was the result of my study of Shakespeare. I had\r\nmade a special point of bringing out the mystic meaning in the\r\norchestra, which I divided into three distinctly different and opposite\r\nelements. I wanted to make the characteristic nature of these elements\r\nclear to the score reader the moment he looked at it by a striking\r\ndisplay of colour, and only the fact that I could not get any green ink\r\nmade this picturesque idea impossible. I employed black ink for the\r\nbrass instruments alone, the strings were to have red and the wind\r\ngreen ink. This extraordinary score I gave for perusal to Heinrich\r\nDorn, who was at that time musical director of the Leipzig theatre. He\r\nwas very young, and impressed me as being a very clever musician and a\r\nwitty man of the world, whom the Leipzig public made much of.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I have never been able to understand how he could have\r\ngranted my request to produce this overture.\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards I was rather inclined to believe with others, who\r\nknew how much he enjoyed a good joke, that he intended to treat himself\r\nto a little fun. At the time, however, he vowed that he thought the\r\nwork interesting, and maintained that if it were only brought out as a\r\nhitherto unknown work by Beethoven, the public would receive it with\r\nrespect, though without understanding.\r\n\r\nIt was the Christmas of the fateful year 1830; as usual, there would be\r\nno performance at the theatre on Christmas Eve, but instead a concert\r\nfor the poor had been organised, which received but scant support. The\r\nfirst item on the programme was called by the exciting title ‘New\r\nOverture’—nothing more! I had surreptitiously listened to the rehearsal\r\nwith some misgiving. I was very much impressed by the coolness with\r\nwhich Dorn fenced with the apparent confusion which the members of the\r\norchestra showed with regard to this mysterious composition. The\r\nprincipal theme of the Allegro was contained in four bars; after every\r\nfourth bar, however, a fifth bar had been inserted, which had nothing\r\nto do with the melody, and which was announced by a loud bang on the\r\nkettle-drum on the second beat. As this drum-beat stood out alone, the\r\ndrummer, who continually thought he was making a mistake, got confused,\r\nand did not give the right sharpness to the accent as prescribed by the\r\nscore. Listening from my hidden corner, and frightened at my original\r\nintention, this accidentally different rendering did not displease me.\r\nTo my genuine annoyance, however, Dorn called the drummer to the front\r\nand insisted on his playing the accents with the prescribed sharpness.\r\nWhen, after the rehearsal, I told the musical director of my misgivings\r\nabout this important fact, I could not get him to promise a milder\r\ninterpretation of the fatal drum-beat; he stuck to it that the thing\r\nwould sound very well as it was. In spite of this assurance my\r\nrestlessness grew, and I had not the courage to introduce myself to my\r\nfriends in advance as the author of the ‘New Overture.’\r\n\r\nMy sister Ottilie, who had already been forced to survive the secret\r\nreadings of Leubald und Adelaïde, was the only person willing to come\r\nwith me to hear my work. It was Christmas Eve, and there was to be the\r\nusual Christmas tree, presents, etc., at my brother-in-law’s, Friedrich\r\nBrockhaus, and both of us naturally wanted to be there. My sister, in\r\nparticular, who lived there, had a good deal to do with the\r\narrangements, and could only get away for a short while, and that with\r\ngreat difficulty; our amiable relation accordingly had the carriage\r\nready for her so that she might get back more quickly. I made use of\r\nthis opportunity to inaugurate, as it were, my entree into the musical\r\nworld in a festive manner. The carriage drew up in front of the\r\ntheatre. Ottilie went into my brother-in-law’s box, which forced me to\r\ntry and find a seat in the pit. I had forgotten to buy a ticket, and\r\nwas refused admission by the man at the door. Suddenly the tuning up of\r\nthe orchestra grew louder and louder, and I thought I should have to\r\nmiss the beginning of my work. In my anxiety I revealed myself to the\r\nman at the door as the composer of the ‘New Overture,’ and in this way\r\nsucceeded in passing without a ticket. I pushed my way through to one\r\nof the first rows of the pit, and sat down in terrible anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe Overture began: after the theme of the ‘black’ brass instruments\r\nhad made itself heard with great emphasis, the ‘red’ Allegro theme\r\nstarted, in which, as I have already mentioned, every fifth bar was\r\ninterrupted by the drum-beat from the ‘black’ world. What kind of\r\neffect the ‘green’ theme of the wind instruments, which joined in\r\nafterwards, produced upon the listeners, and what they must have\r\nthought when ‘black,’ ‘red,’ and ‘green’ themes became intermingled,\r\nhas always remained a mystery to me, for the fatal drum-beat, brutally\r\nhammered out, entirely deprived me of my senses, especially as this\r\nprolonged and continually recurring effect now began to rouse, not only\r\nthe attention, but the merriment of the audience. I heard my neighbours\r\ncalculating the return of this effect; knowing the absolute correctness\r\nof their calculation, I suffered ten thousand torments, and became\r\nalmost unconscious. At last I awoke from my nightmare when the\r\nOverture, to which I had disdained to give what I considered a trite\r\nending, came to a standstill most unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nNo phantoms like those in Hoffmann’s Tales could have succeeded in\r\nproducing the extraordinary state in which I came to my senses on\r\nnoticing the astonishment of the audience at the end of the\r\nperformance. I heard no exclamations of disapproval, no hissing, no\r\nremarks, not even laughter; all I saw was intense astonishment at such\r\na strange occurrence, which impressed them, as it did me, like a\r\nhorrible nightmare. The worst moment, however, came when I had to leave\r\nthe pit and take my sister home. To get up and pass through the people\r\nin the pit was horrible indeed. Nothing, however, equalled the pain of\r\ncoming face to face with the man at the door; the strange look he gave\r\nme haunted me ever afterwards, and for a considerable time I avoided\r\nthe pit of the Leipzig theatre.\r\n\r\nMy next step was to find my sister, who had gone through the whole sad\r\nexperience with infinite pity; in silence we drove home to be present\r\nat a brilliant family festivity, which contrasted with grim irony with\r\nthe gloom of my bewilderment.\r\n\r\nIn spite of it all I tried to believe in myself, and thought I could\r\nfind comfort in my overture to the Braut von Messina, which I believed\r\nto be a better work than the fatal one I had just heard. A\r\nreinstatement, however, was out of the question, for the directors of\r\nthe Leipzig theatre regarded me for a long time as a very doubtful\r\nperson, in spite of Dorn’s friendship. It is true that I still tried my\r\nhand at sketching out compositions to Goethe’s Faust, some of which\r\nhave been preserved to this day: but soon my wild student’s life\r\nresumed its sway and drowned the last remnant of serious musical study\r\nin me.\r\n\r\nI now began to imagine that because I had become a student I ought to\r\nattend the University lectures. From Traugott Krug, who was well known\r\nto me on account of his having suppressed the student’s revolt, I tried\r\nto learn the first principles of philosophy; a single lesson sufficed\r\nto make me give this up. Two or three times, however, I attended the\r\nlectures on aesthetics given by one of the younger professors, a man\r\ncalled Weiss. This perseverance was due to the interest which Weiss\r\nimmediately aroused in me. When I made his acquaintance at my uncle\r\nAdolph’s house, Weiss had just translated the metaphysics of Aristotle,\r\nand, if I am not mistaken, dedicated them in a controversial spirit to\r\nHegel.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion I had listened to the conversation of these two men on\r\nphilosophy and philosophers, which made a tremendous impression on me.\r\nI remember that Weiss was an absent-minded man, with a hasty and abrupt\r\nmanner of speaking; he had an interesting and pensive expression which\r\nimpressed me immensely. I recollect how, on being accused of a want of\r\nclearness in his writing and style, he justified himself by saying that\r\nthe deep problems of the human mind could not in any case be solved by\r\nthe mob. This maxim, which struck me as being very plausible, I at once\r\naccepted as the principle for all my future writing. I remember that my\r\neldest brother Albert, to whom I once had to write for my mother, grew\r\nso disgusted with my letter and style that he said he thought I must be\r\ngoing mad.\r\n\r\nIn spite of my hopes that Weiss’s lectures would do me much good, I was\r\nnot capable of continuing to attend them, as my desires in those days\r\ndrove me to anything but the study of aesthetics. Nevertheless, my\r\nmother’s anxiety at this time on my behalf made me try to take up music\r\nagain. As Muller, the teacher under whom I had studied till that time,\r\nhad not been able to inspire me with a permanent love of study, it was\r\nnecessary to discover whether another teacher might not be better able\r\nto induce me to do serious work.\r\n\r\nTheodor Weinlich, who was choirmaster and musical director at St.\r\nThomas’s Church, held at that time this important and ancient post\r\nwhich was afterwards occupied by Schicht, and before him by no less a\r\nperson than Sebastian Bach. By education he belonged to the old Italian\r\nschool of music, and had studied in Bologna under Pater Martini. He had\r\nmade a name for himself in this art by his vocal compositions, in which\r\nhis fine manner of treating the parts was much praised. He himself told\r\nme one day that a Leipzig publisher had offered him a very substantial\r\nfee if he would write for his firm another book of vocal exercises\r\nsimilar to the one which had proved so profitable to his first\r\npublisher. Weinlich told him that he had not got any exercises of the\r\nkind ready at the moment, but offered him instead a new Mass, which the\r\npublisher refused with the words: ‘Let him who got the meat gnaw the\r\nbones.’ The modesty with which Weinlich told me this little story\r\nshowed how excellent a man he was. As he was in a very bad and weak\r\nstate of health when my mother introduced me to him, he at first\r\nrefused to take me as a pupil. But, after having resisted all\r\npersuasions, he at last took pity on my musical education, which, as he\r\nsoon discovered from a fugue which I had brought with me, was\r\nexceedingly faulty. He accordingly promised to teach me, on condition\r\nthat I should give up all attempts at composing for six months, and\r\nfollow his instructions implicitly. To the first part of my promise I\r\nremained faithful, thanks to the vast vortex of dissipation into which\r\nmy life as a student had drawn me.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, I had to occupy myself for any length of time with\r\nnothing but four-part harmony exercises in strictly rigorous style, it\r\nwas not only the student in me, but also the composer of so many\r\novertures and sonatas, that was thoroughly disgusted. Weinlich, too,\r\nhad his grievances against me, and decided to give me up.\r\n\r\nDuring this period I came to the crisis of my life, which led to the\r\ncatastrophe of that terrible evening at the gambling den. But an even\r\ngreater blow than this fearful experience awaited me when Weinlich\r\ndecided not to have anything more to do with me. Deeply humiliated and\r\nmiserable, I besought the gentle old man, whom I loved dearly, to\r\nforgive me, and I promised him from that moment to work with unflagging\r\nenergy. One morning at seven o’clock Weinlich sent for me to begin the\r\nrough sketch for a fugue; he devoted the whole morning to me, following\r\nmy work bar by bar with the greatest attention, and giving me his\r\nvaluable advice. At twelve o’clock he dismissed me with the instruction\r\nto perfect and finish the sketch by filling in the remaining parts at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nWhen I brought him the fugue finished, he handed me his own treatment\r\nof the same theme for comparison. This common task of fugue writing\r\nestablished between me and my good-natured teacher the tenderest of\r\nties, for, from that moment, we both enjoyed the lessons. I was\r\nastonished how quickly the time flew. In eight weeks I had not only\r\ngone through a number of the most intricate fugues, but had also waded\r\nthrough all kinds of difficult evolutions in counterpoint, when one\r\nday, on bringing him an extremely elaborate double fugue, he took my\r\nbreath away by telling me that after this there was nothing left for\r\nhim to teach me.\r\n\r\nAs I was not aware of any great effort on my part, I often wondered\r\nwhether I had really become a well-equipped musician. Weinlich himself\r\ndid not seem to attach much importance to what he had taught me: he\r\nsaid, ‘Probably you will never write fugues or canons; but what you\r\nhave mastered is Independence: you can now stand alone and rely upon\r\nhaving a fine technique at your fingers’ ends if you should want it.’\r\n\r\nThe principal result of his influence over me was certainly the growing\r\nlove of clearness and fluency to which he had trained me. I had already\r\nhad to write the above-mentioned fugue for ordinary voices; my feeling\r\nfor the melodious and vocal had in this way been awakened. In order to\r\nkeep me strictly under his calming and friendly influence, he had at\r\nthe same time given me a sonata to write which, as a proof of my\r\nfriendship for him, I had to build up on strictly harmonic and thematic\r\nlines, for which he recommended me a very early and childlike sonata by\r\nPleyel as a model.\r\n\r\nThose who had only recently heard my Overture must, indeed, have\r\nwondered how I ever wrote this sonata, which has been published through\r\nthe indiscretion of Messrs. Breitkopf and Hartel (to reward me for my\r\nabstemiousness, Weinlich induced them to publish this poor\r\ncomposition). From that moment he gave me a free hand. To begin with I\r\nwas allowed to compose a Fantasia for the pianoforte (in F sharp minor)\r\nwhich I wrote in a quite informal style by treating the melody in\r\nrecitative form; this gave me intense satisfaction because it won me\r\npraise from Weinlich.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards I wrote three overtures which all met with his entire\r\napproval. In the following winter (1831-1832) I succeeded in getting\r\nthe first of them, in D minor, performed at one of the Gewandhaus\r\nconcerts.\r\n\r\nAt that time a very simple and homely tone reigned supreme in this\r\ninstitution. The instrumental works were not conducted by what we call\r\n‘a conductor of the orchestra,’ but were simply played to the audience\r\nby the leader of the orchestra. As soon as the singing began, Pohlenz\r\ntook his place at the conductor’s desk; he belonged to the type of fat\r\nand pleasant musical directors, and was a great favourite with the\r\nLeipzig public. He used to come on the platform with a very\r\nimportant-looking blue baton in his hand.\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest events which occurred at that time was the yearly\r\nproduction of the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven; after the first three\r\nmovements had been played straight through like a Haydn symphony, as\r\nwell as the orchestra could manage it, Pohlenz, instead of having to\r\nconduct a vocal quartette, a cantata, or an Italian aria, took his\r\nplace at the desk to undertake this highly complicated instrumental\r\nwork, with its particularly enigmatical and incoherent opening, one of\r\nthe most difficult tasks that could possibly be found for a musical\r\nconductor. I shall never forget the impression produced upon me at the\r\nfirst rehearsal by the anxiously and carefully played 3/4 time, and the\r\nway in which the wild shrieks of the trumpet (with which this movement\r\nbegins) resulted in the most extraordinary confusion of sound.\r\n\r\nHe had evidently chosen this tempo in order, in some way, to manage the\r\nrecitative of the double basses; but it was utterly hopeless. Pohlenz\r\nwas in a bath of perspiration, the recitative did not come off, and I\r\nreally began to think that Beethoven must have written nonsense; the\r\ndouble bass player, Temmler, a faithful veteran of the orchestra,\r\nprevailed upon Pohlenz at last, in rather coarse and energetic\r\nlanguage, to put down the baton, and in this way the recitative really\r\nproceeded properly. All the same, I felt at this time that I had come\r\nto the humble conclusion, in a way I can hardly explain, that this\r\nextraordinary work was still beyond my comprehension. For a long time I\r\ngave up brooding over this composition, and I turned my thoughts with\r\nsimple longing towards a clearer and calmer musical form.\r\n\r\nMy study of counterpoint had taught me to appreciate, above all,\r\nMozart’s light and flowing treatment of the most difficult technical\r\nproblems, and the last movement of his great Symphony in C major in\r\nparticular served me as example for my own work. My D minor Overture,\r\nwhich clearly showed the influence of Beethoven’s Coriolanus Overture,\r\nhad been favourably received by the public; my mother began to have\r\nfaith in me again, and I started at once on a second overture (in C\r\nmajor), which really ended with a ‘Fugato’ that did more credit to my\r\nnew model than I had ever hoped to accomplish.\r\n\r\nThis overture, also, was soon afterwards performed at a recital given\r\nby the favourite singer, Mlle. Palazzesi (of the Dresden Italian\r\nOpera). Before this I had already introduced it at a concert given by a\r\nprivate musical society called ‘Euterpe’, when I had conducted it\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nI remember the strange impression I received from a remark that my\r\nmother made on that occasion; as a matter of fact this work, which was\r\nwritten in a counterpoint style, without any real passion or emotion,\r\nhad produced a strange effect upon her. She gave vent to her\r\nastonishment by warmly praising the Egmont Overture, which was played\r\nat the same concert, maintaining that ‘this kind of music was after all\r\nmore fascinating than any stupid fugue.’\r\n\r\nAt this time I also wrote (as my third opus) an overture to Raupach’s\r\ndrama, Konig Enzio, in which again Beethoven’s influence made itself\r\neven more strongly felt. My sister Rosalie succeeded in getting it\r\nperformed at the theatre before the play; for the sake of prudence they\r\ndid not announce it on the programme the first time. Dorn conducted it,\r\nand as the performance went off all right, and the public showed no\r\ndissatisfaction, my overture was played with my full name on the\r\nprogramme several times during the run of the above-mentioned drama.\r\n\r\nAfter this I tried my hand at a big Symphony (in C major); in this work\r\nI showed what I had learnt by using the influence of my study of\r\nBeethoven and Mozart towards the achievement of a really pleasant and\r\nintelligible work, in which the fugue was again present at the end,\r\nwhile the themes of the various movements were so constructed that they\r\ncould be played consecutively.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the passionate and bold element of the Sinfonia Eroica\r\nwas distinctly discernible, especially in the first movement. The slow\r\nmovement, on the contrary, contained reminiscences of my former musical\r\nmysticism. A kind of repeated interrogative exclamation of the minor\r\nthird merging into the fifth connected in my mind this work (which I\r\nhad finished with the utmost effort at clearness) with my very earliest\r\nperiod of boyish sentimentality.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the following year, I called on Friedrich Rochlitz, at that\r\ntime the ‘Nestor’ of the musical aesthetes in Leipzig, and president of\r\nthe Gewandhaus, I prevailed upon him to promise me a performance of my\r\nwork. As he had been given my score for perusal before seeing me, he\r\nwas quite astonished to find that I was a very young man, for the\r\ncharacter of my music had prepared him to see a much older and more\r\nexperienced musician. Before this performance took place many things\r\nhappened which I must first mention, as they were of great importance\r\nto my life.\r\n\r\nMy short and stormy career as a student had drowned in me not only all\r\nlonging for further development, but also all interest in intellectual\r\nand spiritual pursuits. Although, as I have pointed out, I had never\r\nalienated myself entirely from music, my revived interest in politics\r\naroused my first real disgust for my senseless student’s life, which\r\nsoon left no deeper traces on my mind than the remembrance of a\r\nterrible nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe Polish War of Independence against Russian supremacy filled me with\r\ngrowing enthusiasm. The victories which the Poles obtained for a short\r\nperiod during May, 1831, aroused my enthusiastic admiration: it seemed\r\nto me as though the world had, by some miracle, been created anew. As a\r\ncontrast to this, the news of the battle of Ostrolenka made it appear\r\nas if the end of the world had come. To my astonishment, my boon\r\ncompanions scoffed at me when I commented upon some of these events;\r\nthe terrible lack of all fellow-feeling and comradeship amongst the\r\nstudents struck me very forcibly. Any kind of enthusiasm had to be\r\nsmothered or turned into pedantic bravado, which showed itself in the\r\nform of affectation and indifference. To get drunk with deliberate\r\ncold-bloodedness, without even a glimpse of humour, was reckoned almost\r\nas brave a feat as duelling. Not until much later did I understand the\r\nfar nobler spirit which animated the lower classes in Germany in\r\ncomparison with the sadly degenerate state of the University students.\r\nIn those days I felt terribly indignant at the insulting remarks which\r\nI brought upon myself when I deplored the battle of Ostrolenka.\r\n\r\nTo my honour be it said, that these and similar impressions helped to\r\nmake me give up my low associates. During my studies with Weinlich the\r\nonly little dissipation I allowed myself was my daily evening visit to\r\nKintschy, the confectioner in the Klostergasse, where I passionately\r\ndevoured the latest newspapers. Here I found many men who held the same\r\npolitical views as myself, and I specially loved to listen to the eager\r\npolitical discussions of some of the old men who frequented the place.\r\nThe literary journals, too, began to interest me; I read a great deal,\r\nbut was not very particular in my choice. Nevertheless, I now began to\r\nappreciate intelligence and wit, whereas before only the grotesque and\r\nthe fantastic had had any attraction for me.\r\n\r\nMy interest in the issue of the Polish war, however, remained\r\nparamount. I felt the siege and capture of Warsaw as a personal\r\ncalamity. My excitement when the remains of the Polish army began to\r\npass through Leipzig on their way to France was indescribable, and I\r\nshall never forget the impression produced upon me by the first batch\r\nof these unfortunate soldiers on the occasion of their being quartered\r\nat the Green Shield, a public-house in the Meat Market. Much as this\r\ndepressed me, I was soon roused to a high pitch of enthusiasm, for in\r\nthe lounge of the Leipzig Gewandhaus, where that night Beethoven’s C\r\nminor Symphony was being played, a group of heroic figures, the\r\nprincipal leaders of the Polish revolution, excited my admiration. I\r\nfelt more particularly attracted by Count Vincenz Tyszkiewitcz, a man\r\nof exceptionally powerful physique and noble appearance, who impressed\r\nme by his dignified and aristocratic manner and his quiet\r\nself-reliance—qualities with which I had not met before. When I saw a\r\nman of such kingly bearing in a tight-fitting coat and red velvet cap,\r\nI at once realised my foolishness in ever having worshipped the\r\nludicrously dressed up little heroes of our students’ world. I was\r\ndelighted to meet this gentleman again at the house of my\r\nbrother-in-law, Friedrich Brockhaus, where I saw him frequently.\r\n\r\nMy brother-in-law had the greatest pity and sympathy for the Polish\r\nrebels, and was the president of a committee whose task it was to look\r\nafter their interests, and for a long time he made many personal\r\nsacrifices for their cause.\r\n\r\nThe Brockhaus establishment now became tremendously attractive to me.\r\nAround Count Vincenz Tyszkiewitcz, who remained the lodestar of this\r\nsmall Polish world, gathered a great many other wealthy exiles, amongst\r\nwhom I chiefly remember a cavalry captain of the name of Bansemer, a\r\nman of unlimited kindness, but of a rather frivolous nature; he\r\npossessed a marvellous team of four horses which he drove at such\r\nbreakneck speed as to cause great annoyance to the people of Leipzig.\r\nAnother man of importance with whom I remember dining was General Bem,\r\nwhose artillery had made such a gallant stand at Ostrolenka.\r\n\r\nMany other exiles passed through this hospitable house, some of whom\r\nimpressed us by their melancholy, warlike bearing, others by their\r\nrefined behaviour. Vincenz Tyszkiewitcz, however, remained my ideal of\r\na true man, and I loved him with a profound adoration. He, too, began\r\nto be interested in me; I used to call upon him nearly every day, and\r\nwas sometimes present at a sort of martial feast, from which he often\r\nwithdrew in order to be able to open his heart to me about the\r\nanxieties which oppressed him. He had, in fact, received absolutely no\r\nnews of the whereabouts of his wife and little son since they separated\r\nat Volhynien. Besides this, he was under the shadow of a great sorrow\r\nwhich drew all sympathetic natures to him. To my sister Louise he had\r\nconfided the terrible calamity that had once befallen him. He had been\r\nmarried before, and while staying with his wife in one of his lonely\r\ncastles, in the dead of night he had seen a ghostly apparition at the\r\nwindow of his bedroom. Hearing his name called several times, he had\r\ntaken up a revolver to protect himself from possible danger, and had\r\nshot his own wife, who had had the eccentric idea of teasing him by\r\npretending to be a ghost. I had the pleasure of sharing his joy on\r\nhearing that his family was safe. His wife joined him in Leipzig with\r\ntheir beautiful boy, Janusz. I felt sorry not to be able to feel the\r\nsame sympathy for this lady as I did for her husband; perhaps one of\r\nthe reasons of my antipathy was the obvious and conspicuous way in\r\nwhich she made herself up, by means of which the poor woman probably\r\ntried to hide how much her beauty had suffered through the terrible\r\nstrain of the past events. She soon went back to Galicia to try and\r\nsave what she could of their property, and also to provide her husband\r\nwith a pass from the Austrian Government, by means of which he could\r\nfollow her.\r\n\r\nThen came the third of May. Eighteen of the Poles who were still in\r\nLeipzig met together at a festive dinner in a hotel outside the town;\r\non this day was to be celebrated the first anniversary of the third of\r\nMay, so dear to the memory of the Poles. Only the chiefs of the Leipzig\r\nPolish Committee received invitations, and as a special favour I also\r\nwas asked. I shall never forget that occasion. The dinner became an\r\norgy; throughout the evening a brass band from the town played Polish\r\nfolksongs, and these were sung by the whole company, led by a\r\nLithuanian called Zan, in a manner now triumphant and now mournful. The\r\nbeautiful ‘Third of May’ song more particularly drew forth a positive\r\nuproar of enthusiasm. Tears and shouts of joy grew into a terrible\r\ntumult; the excited men grouped themselves on the grass swearing\r\neternal friendship in the most extravagant terms, for which the word\r\n‘Oiczisna’ (Fatherland) provided the principal theme, until at last\r\nnight threw her veil over this wild debauch.\r\n\r\nThat evening afterwards served me as the theme for an orchestral\r\ncomposition (in the form of an overture) named Polonia; I shall recount\r\nthe fate of this work later on. My friend Tyszkiewitcz’s passport now\r\narrived, and he made up his mind to go back to Galicia via Brunn,\r\nalthough his friends considered it was very rash of him to do so. I\r\nvery much wanted to see something of the world, and Tyszkiewitcz’s\r\noffer to take me with him, induced my mother to consent to my going to\r\nVienna, a place that I had long wished to visit. I took with me the\r\nscores of my three overtures which had already been performed, and also\r\nthat of my great symphony as yet unproduced, and had a grand time with\r\nmy Polish patron, who took me in his luxurious travelling-coach as far\r\nas the capital of Moravia. During a short stop at Dresden the exiles of\r\nall classes gave our beloved Count a friendly farewell dinner in Pirna,\r\nat which the champagne flowed freely, while the health was drunk of the\r\nfuture ‘Dictator of Poland.’\r\n\r\nAt last we separated at Brunn, from which place I continued my journey\r\nto Vienna by coach. During the afternoon and night, which I was obliged\r\nto spend in Brunn by myself, I went through terrible agonies from fear\r\nof the cholera which, as I unexpectedly heard, had broken out in this\r\nplace. There I was all alone in a strange place, my faithful friend\r\njust departed, and on hearing of the epidemic I felt as if a malicious\r\ndemon had caught me in his snare in order to annihilate me. I did not\r\nbetray my terror to the people in the hotel, but when I was shown into\r\na very lonely wing of the house and left by myself in this wilderness,\r\nI hid myself in bed with my clothes on, and lived once again through\r\nall the horrors of ghost stories as I had done in my boyhood. The\r\ncholera stood before me like a living thing; I could see and touch it;\r\nit lay in my bed and embraced me. My limbs turned to ice, I felt frozen\r\nto the very marrow. Whether I was awake or asleep I never knew; I only\r\nremember how astonished I was when, on awakening, I felt thoroughly\r\nwell and healthy.\r\n\r\nAt last I arrived in Vienna, where I escaped the epidemic which had\r\npenetrated as far as that town. It was midsummer of the year 1832.\r\nOwing to the introductions I had with me, I found myself very much at\r\nhome in this lively city, in which I made a pleasant stay of six weeks.\r\nAs my sojourn, however, had no really practical purpose, my mother\r\nlooked upon the cost of this holiday, short as it seemed, as an\r\nunnecessary extravagance on my part. I visited the theatres, heard\r\nStrauss, made excursions, and altogether had a very good time. I am\r\nafraid I contracted a few debts as well, which I paid off later on when\r\nI was conductor of the Dresden orchestra. I had received very pleasant\r\nimpressions of musical and theatrical life, and for a long time Vienna\r\nlived in my memory as the acme of that extraordinarily productive\r\nspirit peculiar to its people. I enjoyed most of all the performances\r\nat the Theater an der Wien, at which they were acting a grotesque fairy\r\nplay called Die Abenteuer Fortunat’s zu Wasser und zu Land, in which a\r\ncab was called on the shores of the Black Sea and which made a\r\ntremendous impression on me. About the music I was more doubtful. A\r\nyoung friend of mine took me with immense pride to a performance of\r\nGluck’s Iphigenia in Tauris, which was made doubly attractive by a\r\nfirst-rate cast including Wild, Staudigl and Binder: I must confess\r\nthat on the whole I was bored by this work, but I did not dare say so.\r\nMy ideas of Gluck had attained gigantic proportions from my reading of\r\nHoffmann’s well-known Phantasies; my anticipation of this work\r\ntherefore, which I had not studied yet, had led me to expect a\r\ntreatment full of overpowering dramatic force. It is possible that\r\nSchroder-Devrient’s acting in Fidelio had taught me to judge everything\r\nby her exalted standard.\r\n\r\nWith the greatest trouble I worked myself up to some kind of enthusiasm\r\nfor the great scene between Orestes and the Furies. I hoped against\r\nhope that I should be able to admire the remainder of the opera. I\r\nbegan to understand the Viennese taste, however, when I saw how great a\r\nfavourite the opera Zampa became with the public, both at the Karnthner\r\nThor and at the Josephstadt. Both theatres competed vigorously in the\r\nproduction of this popular work, and although the public had seemed mad\r\nabout Iphigenia, nothing equalled their enthusiasm for Zampa. No sooner\r\nhad they left the Josephstadt Theatre in the greatest ecstasies about\r\nZampa than they proceeded to the public-house called the Strausslein.\r\nHere they were immediately greeted by the strains of selections from\r\nZampa which drove the audience to feverish excitement. I shall never\r\nforget the extraordinary playing of Johann Strauss, who put equal\r\nenthusiasm into everything he played, and very often made the audience\r\nalmost frantic with delight.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of a new waltz this demon of the Viennese musical\r\nspirit shook like a Pythian priestess on the tripod, and veritable\r\ngroans of ecstasy (which, without doubt, were more due to his music\r\nthan to the drinks in which the audience had indulged) raised their\r\nworship for the magic violinist to almost bewildering heights of\r\nfrenzy.\r\n\r\nThe hot summer air of Vienna was absolutely impregnated with Zampa and\r\nStrauss. A very poor students’ rehearsal at the Conservatoire, at which\r\nthey performed a Mass by Cherubini, seemed to me like an alms paid\r\nbegrudgingly to the study of classical music. At the same rehearsal one\r\nof the professors, to whom I was introduced, tried to make the students\r\nplay my Overture in D minor (the one already performed in Leipzig). I\r\ndo not know what his opinion was, nor that of the students, with regard\r\nto this attempt; I only know they soon gave it up.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I had wandered into doubtful musical bypaths; and I now\r\nwithdrew from this first educational visit to a great European art\r\ncentre in order to start on a cheap, but long and monotonous return\r\njourney to Bohemia, by stage-coach. My next move was a visit to the\r\nhouse of Count Pachta, of whom I had pleasant recollections from my\r\nboyhood days. His estate, Pravonin, was about eight miles from Prague.\r\nReceived in the kindest possible way by the old gentleman and his\r\nbeautiful daughters, I enjoyed his delightful hospitality until late\r\ninto the autumn. A youth of nineteen, as I then was, with a\r\nfast-growing beard (for which my sisters had already prepared the young\r\nladies by letter), the continual and close intimacy with such kind and\r\npretty girls could hardly fail to make a strong impression on my\r\nimagination. Jenny, the elder of the two, was slim, with black hair,\r\nblue eyes, and wonderfully noble features; the younger one, Auguste,\r\nwas a little smaller, and stouter, with a magnificent complexion, fair\r\nhair, and brown eyes. The natural and sisterly manner with which both\r\ngirls treated me and conversed with me did not blind me to the fact\r\nthat I was expected to fall in love with one or the other of them. It\r\namused them to see how embarrassed I got in my efforts to choose\r\nbetween them, and consequently they teased me tremendously.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I did not act judiciously with regard to the daughters\r\nof my host: in spite of their homely education, they belonged to a very\r\naristocratic house, and consequently hesitated between the hope of\r\nmarrying men of eminent position in their own sphere, and the necessity\r\nof choosing husbands amongst the higher middle classes, who could\r\nafford to keep them in comfort. The shockingly poor, almost mediaeval,\r\neducation of the Austrian so-called cavalier, made me rather despise\r\nthe latter; the girls, too, had suffered from the same lack of proper\r\ntraining. I soon noticed with disgust how little they knew about things\r\nartistic, and how much value they attached to superficial things.\r\nHowever much I might try to interest them in those higher pursuits\r\nwhich had become necessary to me, they were incapable of appreciating\r\nthem. I advocated a complete change from the bad library novels, which\r\nrepresented their only reading, from the Italian operatic arias, sung\r\nby Auguste, and, last but not least, from the horsy, insipid cavaliers,\r\nwho paid their court to both Jenny and her sister in the most coarse\r\nand offensive manner. My zeal in this latter respect soon gave rise to\r\ngreat unpleasantness. I became hard and insulting, harangued them about\r\nthe French Revolution, and begged them with fatherly admonitions ‘for\r\nthe love of heaven’ to be content with well-educated middle-class men,\r\nand give up those impertinent suitors who could only harm their\r\nreputation. The indignation provoked by my friendly advice I often had\r\nto ward off with the harshest retorts. I never apologised, but tried by\r\ndint of real or feigned jealousy to get our friendship back on the old\r\nfooting. In this way, undecided, half in love and half angry, one cold\r\nNovember day I said good-bye to these pretty children. I soon met the\r\nwhole family again at Prague, where I made a long sojourn, without,\r\nhowever, staying at the Count’s residence.\r\n\r\nMy stay at Prague was to be of great musical importance to me. I knew\r\nthe director of the Conservatoire, Dionys Weber, who promised to bring\r\nmy symphony before the public; I also spent much of my time with an\r\nactor called Moritz, to whom, as an old friend of our family, I had\r\nbeen recommended, and there I made the acquaintance of the young\r\nmusician Kittl.\r\n\r\nMoritz, who noticed that not a day passed but what I went to the\r\nmuch-feared chief of the Conservatoire upon some pressing musical\r\nbusiness, once despatched me with an improvised parody on Schiller’s\r\nBurgschaft:—\r\n\r\nZu Dionys dem Direktor schlich\r\nWagner, die Partitur im Gewande;\r\nIhn schlugen die Schuler im Bande:\r\n‘Was wolltest du mit den Noten sprich?’\r\nEntgegnet ihm finster der Wutherich:\r\n‘Die Stadt vom schlechten Geschmacke befreien!\r\nDas sollst du in den Rezensionen bereuen.’[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] To Dionys, the Director,\r\ncrept Wagner, the score in his pocket;\r\nThe students arrested him forthwith:\r\n‘What do’st thou with that music, say?’\r\nThus asked him the angry tyrant:\r\n‘To free the town from taste too vile!\r\nFor this the critics will make thee suffer.’\r\n\r\n\r\nTruly I had to deal with a kind of ‘Dionysius the Tyrant.’ A man who\r\ndid not acknowledge Beethoven’s genius beyond his Second Symphony, a\r\nman who looked upon the Eroica as the acme of bad taste on the master’s\r\npart; who praised Mozart alone, and next to him tolerated only\r\nLindpaintner: such a man was not easy to approach, and I had to learn\r\nthe art of making use of tyrants for one’s own purposes. I\r\ndissimulated; I pretended to be struck by the novelty of his ideas,\r\nnever contradicted him, and, to point out the similarity of our\r\nstandpoints, I referred him to the end fugue in my Overture and in my\r\nSymphony (both in C major), which I had only succeeded in making what\r\nthey were through having studied Mozart. My reward soon followed:\r\nDionys set to work to study my orchestral creations with almost\r\nyouthful energy.\r\n\r\nThe students of the Conservatoire were compelled to practise with the\r\ngreatest exactitude my new symphony under his dry and terribly noisy\r\nbaton. In the presence of several of my friends, amongst whom was also\r\nthe dear old Count Pachta in his capacity of President of the\r\nConservatoire Committee, we actually held a first performance of the\r\ngreatest work that I had written up to that date.\r\n\r\nDuring these musical successes I went on with my love-making in the\r\nattractive house of Count Pachta, under the most curious circumstances.\r\nA confectioner of the name of Hascha was my rival. He was a tall, lanky\r\nyoung man who, like most Bohemians, had taken up music as a hobby; he\r\nplayed the accompaniments to Auguste’s songs, and naturally fell in\r\nlove with her. Like myself, he hated the frequent visits of the\r\ncavaliers, which seemed to be quite the custom in this city; but while\r\nmy displeasure expressed itself in humour, his showed itself in gloomy\r\nmelancholy. This mood made him behave boorishly in public: for\r\ninstance, one evening, when the chandelier was to be lighted for the\r\nreception of one of these gentlemen, he ran his head purposely against\r\nthis ornament and broke it. The festive illumination was thus rendered\r\nimpossible; the Countess was furious, and Hascha had to leave the house\r\nnever to return.\r\n\r\nI well remember that the first time I was conscious of any feelings of\r\nlove, these manifested themselves as pangs of jealousy, which had,\r\nhowever, nothing to do with real love: this happened one evening when I\r\ncalled at the house. The Countess kept me by her side in an ante-room,\r\nwhile the girls, beautifully dressed and gay, flirted in the\r\nreception-room with those hateful young noblemen. All I had ever read\r\nin Hoffmann’s Tales of certain demoniacal intrigues, which until that\r\nmoment had been obscure to me, now became really tangible facts, and I\r\nleft Prague with an obviously unjust and exaggerated opinion of those\r\nthings and those people, through whom I had suddenly been dragged into\r\nan unknown world of elementary passions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I had gained by my stay at Pravonin: I had written\r\npoetry as well as musical compositions. My musical work was a setting\r\nof Glockentone, a poem by the friend of my youth, Theodor Apel. I had\r\nalready written an aria for soprano which had been performed the winter\r\nbefore at one of the theatre concerts. But my new work was decidedly\r\nthe first vocal piece I had written with real inspiration; generally\r\nspeaking, I suppose it owed its’ characteristics to the influence of\r\nBeethoven’s Liederkreis: all the same, the impression that it has left\r\non my mind is that it was absolutely part of myself, and pervaded by a\r\ndelicate sentimentality which was brought into relief by the dreaminess\r\nof the accompaniment. My poetical efforts lay in the direction of a\r\nsketch of a tragi-operatic subject, which I finished in its entirety in\r\nPrague under the title of Die Hochzeit (‘The Wedding’). I wrote it\r\nwithout anybody’s knowledge, and this was no easy matter, seeing that I\r\ncould not write in my chilly little hotel-room, and had therefore to go\r\nto the house of Moritz, where I generally spent my mornings. I remember\r\nhow I used quickly to hide my manuscript behind the sofa as soon as I\r\nheard my host’s footsteps.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary episode was connected with the plot of this work.\r\n\r\nAlready years ago I had come across a tragic story, whilst perusing\r\nBusching’s book on chivalry, the like of which I have never since read.\r\nA lady of noble birth had been assaulted one night by a man who\r\nsecretly cherished a passionate love for her, and in the struggle to\r\ndefend her honour superhuman strength was given her to fling him into\r\nthe courtyard below. The mystery of his death remained unexplained\r\nuntil the day of his solemn obsequies, when the lady herself, who\r\nattended them and was kneeling in solemn prayer, suddenly fell forward\r\nand expired. The mysterious strength of this profound and passionate\r\nstory made an indelible impression upon my mind. Fascinated, moreover,\r\nby the peculiar treatment of similar phenomena in Hoffmann’s Tales, I\r\nsketched a novel in which musical mysticism, which I still loved so\r\ndeeply, played an important part. The action was supposed to take place\r\non the estate of a rich patron of the fine arts: a young couple was\r\ngoing to be married, and had invited the friend of the bride-groom, an\r\ninteresting but melancholy and mysterious young man, to their wedding.\r\nIntimately connected with the whole affair was a strange old organist.\r\nThe mystic relations which gradually developed between the old\r\nmusician, the melancholy young man and the bride, were to grow out of\r\nthe unravelment of certain intricate events, in a somewhat similar\r\nmanner to that of the mediaeval story above related. Here was the same\r\nidea: the young man mysteriously killed, the equally strange sudden\r\ndeath of his friend’s bride, and the old organist found dead on his\r\nbench after the playing of an impressive requiem, the last chord of\r\nwhich was inordinately prolonged as if it never would end.\r\n\r\nI never finished this novel: but as I wanted to write the libretto for\r\nan opera, I took up the theme again in its original shape, and built on\r\nthis (as far as the principal features went) the following dramatic\r\nplot:—\r\n\r\nTwo great houses had lived in enmity, and had at last decided to end\r\nthe family feud. The aged head of one of these houses invited the son\r\nof his former enemy to the wedding of his daughter with one of his\r\nfaithful partisans. The wedding feast is thus used as an opportunity\r\nfor reconciling the two families. Whilst the guests are full of the\r\nsuspicion and fear of treachery, their young leader falls violently in\r\nlove with the bride of his newly found ally. His tragic glance deeply\r\naffects her; the festive escort accompanies her to the bridal chamber,\r\nwhere she is to await her beloved; leaning against her tower-window she\r\nsees the same passionate eyes fixed on her, and realises that she is\r\nface to face with a tragedy.\r\n\r\nWhen he penetrates into her chamber, and embraces her with frantic\r\npassion, she pushes him backwards towards the balcony, and throws him\r\nover the parapet into the abyss, from whence his mutilated remains are\r\ndragged by his companions. They at once arm themselves against the\r\npresumed treachery, and call for vengeance; tumult and confusion fill\r\nthe courtyard: the interrupted wedding feast threatens to end in a\r\nnight of slaughter. The venerable head of the house at last succeeds in\r\naverting the catastrophe. Messengers are sent to bear the tidings of\r\nthe mysterious calamity to the relatives of the victim: the corpse\r\nitself shall be the medium of reconciliation, for, in the presence of\r\nthe different generations of the suspected family, Providence itself\r\nshall decide which of its members has been guilty of treason. During\r\nthe preparations for the obsequies the bride shows signs of approaching\r\nmadness; she flies from her bridegroom, refuses to be united to him,\r\nand locks herself up in her tower-chamber. Only when, at night, the\r\ngloomy though gorgeous ceremony commences, does she appear at the head\r\nof her women to be present at the burial service, the gruesome\r\nsolemnity of which is interrupted by the news of the approach of\r\nhostile forces and then by the armed attack of the kinsmen of the\r\nmurdered man. When the avengers of the presumed treachery penetrate\r\ninto the chapel and call upon the murderer to declare himself, the\r\nhorrified lord of the manor points towards his daughter who, turning\r\naway from her bridegroom, falls lifeless by the coffin of her victim.\r\nThis nocturnal drama, through which ran reminiscences of Leubald und\r\nAdelaïde (the work of my far-off boyhood), I wrote in the darkest vein,\r\nbut in a more polished and more noble style, disdaining all\r\nlight-effects, and especially all operatic embellishments. Tender\r\npassages occurred here and there all the same, and Weinlich, to whom I\r\nhad already shown the beginning of my work on my return to Leipzig,\r\npraised me for the clearness and good vocal quality of the introduction\r\nI had composed to the first act; this was an Adagio for a vocal\r\nseptette, in which I had tried to express the reconciliation of the\r\nhostile families, together with the emotions of the wedded couple and\r\nthe sinister passion of the secret lover. My principal object was, all\r\nthe same, to win my sister Rosalie’s approval. My poem, however, did\r\nnot find favour in her eyes: she missed all that which I had purposely\r\navoided, insisted on the ornamentation and development of the simple\r\nsituation, and desired more brightness generally. I made up my mind in\r\nan instant: I took the manuscript, and without a suggestion of\r\nill-temper, destroyed it there and then. This action had nothing\r\nwhatever to do with wounded vanity. It was prompted merely by my desire\r\nhonestly to prove to my sister how little I thought of my own work and\r\nhow much I cared for her opinion. She was held in great and loving\r\nesteem by my mother and by the rest of our family, for she was their\r\nprincipal breadwinner: the important salary she earned as an actress\r\nconstituted nearly the whole income out of which my mother had to\r\ndefray the household expenses. For the sake of her profession she\r\nenjoyed many advantages at home. Her part of the house had been\r\nspecially arranged so that she should have all the necessary comfort\r\nand peace for her studies; on marketing days, when the others had to\r\nput up with the simplest fare, she had to have the same dainty food as\r\nusual. But more than any of these things did her charming gravity and\r\nher refined way of speaking place her above the younger children. She\r\nwas thoughtful and gentle and never joined us in our rather loud\r\nconversation. Of course, I had been the one member of the family who\r\nhad caused the greatest anxieties both to my mother and to my motherly\r\nsister, and during my life as a student the strained relations between\r\nus had made a terrible impression on me. When therefore they tried to\r\nbelieve in me again, and once more showed some interest in my work, I\r\nwas full of gratitude and happiness. The thought of getting this sister\r\nto look kindly upon my aspirations, and even to expect great things of\r\nme, had become a special stimulus to my ambition. Under these\r\ncircumstances a tender and almost sentimental relationship grew up\r\nbetween Rosalie and myself, which in its purity and sincerity could vie\r\nwith the noblest form of friendship between man and woman. This was\r\nprincipally due to her exceptional individuality. She had not any real\r\ntalent, at least not for acting, which had often been considered stagey\r\nand unnatural. Nevertheless she was much appreciated owing to her\r\ncharming appearance as well as to her pure and dignified womanliness,\r\nand I remember many tokens of esteem which she received in those days.\r\nAll the same, none of these advances ever seemed to lead to the\r\nprospect of a marriage, and year by year went by without bringing her\r\nhopes of a suitable match—a fact which to me appeared quite\r\nunaccountable. From time to time I thought I noticed that Rosalie\r\nsuffered from this state of affairs. I remember one evening when,\r\nbelieving herself to be alone, I heard her sobbing and moaning; I stole\r\naway unnoticed, but her grief made such an impression upon me that from\r\nthat moment I vowed to bring some joy into her life, principally by\r\nmaking a name for myself. Not without reason had our stepfather Geyer\r\ngiven my gentle sister the nickname of ‘Geistchen’ (little spirit), for\r\nif her talent as an actress was not great, her imagination and her love\r\nof art and of all high and noble things were perhaps, on that account\r\nalone, all the greater. From her lips I had first heard expressions of\r\nadmiration and delight concerning those subjects which became dear to\r\nme later on, and she moved amongst a circle of serious and interesting\r\npeople who loved the higher things of life without this attitude ever\r\ndegenerating into affectation.\r\n\r\nOn my return from my long journey I was introduced to Heinrich Laube,\r\nwhom my sister had added to her list of intimate friends. It was at the\r\ntime when the after-effects of the July revolution were beginning to\r\nmake themselves felt amongst the younger men of intellect in Germany,\r\nand of these Laube was one of the most conspicuous. As a young man he\r\ncame from Silesia to Leipzig, his principal object being to try and\r\nform connections in this publishing centre which might be of use to him\r\nin Paris, whither he was going, and from which place Borne also made a\r\nsensation amongst us by his letters. On this occasion Laube was present\r\nat a representation of a play by Ludwig Robert, Die Macht der\r\nVerhallnisse (‘The Power of Circumstances’). This induced him to write\r\na criticism for the Leipzig Tageblatt, which made such a sensation\r\nthrough its terse and lively style that he was at once offered, in\r\naddition to other literary work, the post of editor of Die elegante\r\nWelt. In our house he was looked upon as a genius; his curt and often\r\nbiting manner of speaking, which seemed to exclude all attempt at\r\npoetic expression, made him appear both original and daring: his sense\r\nof justice, his sincerity and fearless bluntness made one respect his\r\ncharacter, hardened as it had been in youth by great adversity. On me\r\nhe had a very inspiring effect, and I was very much astonished to find\r\nthat he thought so much of me as to write a flattering notice about my\r\ntalent in his paper after hearing the first performance of my symphony.\r\n\r\nThis performance took place in the beginning of the year 1833 at the\r\nLeipzig Schneider-Herberge. It was, by the bye, in this dignified old\r\nhall that the society ‘Euterpe’ held its concerts! The place was dirty,\r\nnarrow, and poorly lighted, and it was here that my work was introduced\r\nto the Leipzig public for the first time, and by means of an orchestra\r\nthat interpreted it simply disgracefully. I can only think of that\r\nevening as a gruesome nightmare; and my astonishment was therefore all\r\nthe greater at seeing the important notice which Laube wrote about the\r\nperformance. Full of hope, I therefore looked forward to a performance\r\nof the same work at the Gewandhaus concert, which followed soon after,\r\nand which came off brilliantly in every way. It was well received and\r\nwell spoken of in all the papers; of real malice there was not a\r\ntrace—on the contrary, several notices wore encouraging, and Laube, who\r\nhad quickly become celebrated, confided to me that he was going to\r\noffer me a libretto for an opera, which he had first written for\r\nMeyerbeer. This staggered me somewhat, for I was not in the least\r\nprepared to pose as a poet, and my only idea was to write a real plot\r\nfor an opera. As to the precise manner, however, in which such a book\r\nhad to be written, I already had a very definite and instinctive\r\nnotion, and I was strengthened in the certainty of my own feelings in\r\nthe matter when Laube now explained the nature of his plot to me. He\r\ntold me that he wanted to arrange nothing less than Kosziusko into a\r\nlibretto for grand opera! Once again I had qualms, for I felt at once\r\nthat Laube had a mistaken idea about the character of a dramatic\r\nsubject. When I inquired into the real action of the play, Laube was\r\nastonished that I should expect more than the story of the Polish hero,\r\nwhose life was crowded with incident; in any case, he thought there was\r\nquite sufficient action in it to describe the unhappy fate of a whole\r\nnation. Of course the usual heroine was not missing; she was a Polish\r\ngirl who had a love affair with a Russian; and in this way some\r\nsentimental situations were also to be found in the plot. Without a\r\nmoment’s delay I assured my sister Rosalie that I would not set this\r\nstory to music: she agreed with me, and begged me only to postpone my\r\nanswer to Laube. My journey to Wurzburg was of great help to me in this\r\nrespect, for it was easier to write my decision to Laube than to\r\nannounce it to him personally. He accepted the slight rebuff with good\r\ngrace, but he never forgave me, either then or afterwards, for writing\r\nmy own words!\r\n\r\nWhen he heard what subject I had preferred to his brilliant political\r\npoem, he made no effort to conceal his contempt for my choice. I had\r\nborrowed the plot from a dramatic fairy tale by Gozzi, La Donna\r\nSerpente, and called it Die Feen (‘The Fairies’). The names of my\r\nheroes I chose from different Ossian and similar poems: my prince was\r\ncalled Arindal; he was loved by a fairy called Ada, who held him under\r\nher spell and kept him in fairyland, away from his realm, until his\r\nfaithful friends at last found him and induced him to return, for his\r\ncountry was going to rack and ruin, and even its capital had fallen\r\ninto the enemy’s hands. The loving fairy herself sends the prince back\r\nto his country; for the oracle has decreed that she shall lay upon her\r\nlover the severest of tasks. Only by performing this task triumphantly\r\ncan he make it possible for her to leave the immortal world of fairies\r\nin order to share the fate of her earthly lover, as his wife. In a\r\nmoment of deepest despair about the state of his country, the fairy\r\nqueen appears to him and purposely destroys his faith in her by deeds\r\nof the most cruel and inexplicable nature. Driven mad by a thousand\r\nfears, Arindal begins to imagine that all the time he has been dealing\r\nwith a wicked sorceress, and tries to escape the fatal spell by\r\npronouncing a curse upon Ada. Wild with sorrow, the unhappy fairy sinks\r\ndown, and reveals their mutual fate to the lover, now lost to her for\r\never, and tells him that, as a punishment for having disobeyed the\r\ndecree of Fate, she is doomed to be turned into stone (in Gozzi’s\r\nversion she becomes a serpent). Immediately afterwards it appears that\r\nall the catastrophes which the fairy had prophesied were but\r\ndeceptions: victory over the enemy as well as the growing prosperity\r\nand welfare of the kingdom now follow in quick succession: Ada is taken\r\naway by the Fates, and Arindal, a raving madman, remains behind alone.\r\nThe terrible sufferings of his madness do not, however, satisfy the\r\nFates: to bring about his utter ruin they appear before the repentant\r\nman and invite him to follow them to the nether world, on the pretext\r\nof enabling him to free Ada from the spell. Through the treacherous\r\npromises of the wicked fairies Arindal’s madness grows into sublime\r\nexaltation; and one of his household magicians, a faithful friend,\r\nhaving in the meantime equipped him with magic weapons and charms, he\r\nnow follows the traitresses. The latter cannot get over their\r\nastonishment when they see how Arindal overcomes one after the other of\r\nthe monsters of the infernal regions: only when they arrive at the\r\nvault in which they show him the stone in human shape do they recover\r\ntheir hope of vanquishing the valiant prince, for, unless he can break\r\nthe charm which binds Ada, he must share her fate and be doomed to\r\nremain a stone for ever. Arindal, who until then has been using the\r\ndagger and the shield given him by the friendly magician, now makes use\r\nof an instrument—a lyre—which he has brought with him, and the meaning\r\nof which he had not yet understood. To the sounds of this instrument he\r\nnow expresses his plaintive moans, his remorse, and his overpowering\r\nlonging for his enchanted queen. The stone is moved by the magic of his\r\nlove: the beloved one is released. Fairyland with all its marvels opens\r\nits portals, and the mortal learns that, owing to his former\r\ninconstancy, Ada has lost the right to become his wife on earth, but\r\nthat her beloved, through his great and magic power, has earned the\r\nright to live for ever by her side in fairyland.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had written Die Hochzeit in the darkest vein, without\r\noperatic embellishments, I painted this subject with the utmost colour\r\nand variety. In contrast to the lovers out of fairyland I depicted a\r\nmore ordinary couple, and I even introduced a third pair that belonged\r\nto the coarser and more comical servant world. I purposely went to no\r\npains in the matter of the poetic diction and the verse. My idea was\r\nnot to encourage my former hopes of making a name as a poet; I was now\r\nreally a ‘musician’ and a ‘composer,’ and wished to write a decent\r\nopera libretto simply because I was sure that nobody else could write\r\none for me; the reason being that such a book is something quite unique\r\nand cannot be written either by a poet or by a mere man of letters.\r\nWith the intention of setting this libretto to music, I left Leipzig in\r\nJanuary, 1833, to stay in Wurzburg with my eldest brother Albert, who\r\nat the time held an appointment at the theatre. It now seemed necessary\r\nfor me to begin to apply my musical knowledge to a practical purpose,\r\nand to this end my brother had promised to help me in getting some kind\r\nof post at the small Wurzburg theatre. I travelled by post to Bamberg\r\nvia Hof, and in Bamberg I stayed a few days in the company of a young\r\nman called Schunke, who from a player on the horn had become an actor.\r\nWith the greatest interest I learned the story of Caspar Hauser, who at\r\nthat time was very well known, and who (if I am not mistaken) was\r\npointed out to me. In addition to this, I admired the peculiar costumes\r\nof the market-women, thought with much interest of Hoffmann’s stay at\r\nthis place, and of how it had led to the writing of his Tales, and\r\nresumed my journey (to Wurzburg) with a man called Hauderer, and\r\nsuffered miserably from the cold all the way.\r\n\r\nMy brother Albert, who was almost a new acquaintance to me, did his\r\nbest to make me feel at home in his not over luxurious establishment.\r\nHe was pleased to find me less mad than he had expected me to be from a\r\ncertain letter with which I had succeeded in frightening him some time\r\npreviously, and he really managed to procure me an exceptional\r\noccupation as choir-master at the theatre, for which I received the\r\nmonthly fee of ten guilders. The remainder of the winter was devoted to\r\nthe serious study of the duties required of a musical director: in a\r\nvery short time I had to tackle two new grand operas, namely,\r\nMarschner’s Vampir and Meyerbeer’s Robert der Teufel, in both of which\r\nthe chorus played a considerable part. At first I felt absolutely like\r\na beginner, and had to start on Camilla von Paer, the score of which\r\nwas utterly unknown to me. I still remember that I felt I was doing a\r\nthing which I had no right to undertake: I felt quite an amateur at the\r\nwork. Soon, however, Marschner’s score interested me sufficiently to\r\nmake the labour seem worth my while. The score of Robert was a great\r\ndisappointment to me: from the newspapers I had expected plenty of\r\noriginality and novelty; I could find no trace of either in this\r\ntransparent work, and an opera with a finale like that of the second\r\nact could not be named in the same breath with any of my favourite\r\nworks. The only thing that impressed me was the unearthly keyed trumpet\r\nwhich, in the last act, represented the voice of the mother’s ghost.\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable to observe the aesthetic demoralisation into which I\r\nnow fell through having daily to deal with such a work. I gradually\r\nlost my dislike for this shallow and exceedingly uninteresting\r\ncomposition (a dislike I shared with many German musicians) in the\r\ngrowing interest which I was compelled to take in its interpretation;\r\nand thus it happened that the insipidness and affectation of the\r\ncommonplace melodies ceased to concern me save from the standpoint of\r\ntheir capability of eliciting applause or the reverse. As, moreover, my\r\nfuture career as musical conductor was at stake, my brother, who was\r\nvery anxious on my behalf, looked favourably on this lack of classical\r\nobstinacy on my part, and thus the ground was gradually prepared for\r\nthat decline in my classical taste which was destined to last some\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\nAll the same, this did not occur before I had given some proof of my\r\ngreat inexperience in the lighter style of writing. My brother wanted\r\nto introduce a ‘Cavatine’ from the Piraten, by Bellini, into the same\r\ncomposer’s opera, Straniera; the score was not to be had, and he\r\nentrusted me with the instrumentation of this work. From the piano\r\nscore alone I could not possibly detect the heavy and noisy\r\ninstrumentation of the ritornelles and intermezzi which, musically,\r\nwere so very thin; the composer of a great C major Symphony with an end\r\nfugue could only help himself out of the difficulty by the use of a few\r\nflutes and clarinets playing in thirds. At the rehearsal the ‘Cavatine’\r\nsounded so frightfully thin and shallow that my brother made me serious\r\nreproaches about the waste of copying expenses. But I had my revenge:\r\nto the tenor aria of ‘Aubry’ in Marschner’s Vampir I added an Allegro,\r\nfor which I also wrote the words.\r\n\r\nMy work succeeded splendidly, and earned the praise of both the public\r\nand my brother. In a similar German style I wrote the music to my Feen\r\nin the course of the year 1833. My brother and his wife left Wurzburg\r\nafter Easter in order to avail themselves of several invitations at\r\nfriends’ houses; I stayed behind with the children—three little girls\r\nof tender years—which placed me in the extraordinary position of a\r\nresponsible guardian, a post for which I was not in the least suited at\r\nthat time of my life. My time was divided between my work and pleasure,\r\nand in consequence I neglected my charges. Amongst the friends I made\r\nthere, Alexander Muller had much influence over me; he was a good\r\nmusician and pianist, and I used to listen for hours to his\r\nimprovisations on given themes—an accomplishment in which he so greatly\r\nexcelled, that I could not fail to be impressed. With him and some\r\nother friends, amongst whom was also Valentin Hamm, I often made\r\nexcursions in the neighbourhood, on which occasions the Bavarian beer\r\nand the Frankish wine were wont to fly. Valentin Hamm was a grotesque\r\nindividual, who entertained us often with his excellent violin playing;\r\nhe had an enormous stretch on the piano, for he could reach an interval\r\nof a twelfth. Der Letzte Hieb, a public beer-garden situated on a\r\npleasant height, was a daily witness of my fits of wild and often\r\nenthusiastic boisterousness; never once during those mild summer nights\r\ndid I return to my charges without having waxed enthusiastic over art\r\nand the world in general. I also remember a wicked trick which has\r\nalways remained a blot in my memory. Amongst my friends was a fair and\r\nvery enthusiastic Swabian called Frohlich, with whom I had exchanged my\r\nscore of the C minor Symphony for his, which he had copied out with his\r\nown hand. This very gentle, but rather irritable young man had taken\r\nsuch a violent dislike to one Andre, whose malicious face I also\r\ndetested, that he declared that this person spoilt his evenings for\r\nhim, merely by being in the same room with him. The unfortunate object\r\nof his hatred tried all the same to meet us whenever he could: friction\r\nensued, but Andre would insist upon aggravating us. One evening\r\nFrohlich lost patience. After some insulting retort, he tried to chase\r\nhim from our table by striking him with a stick: the result was a fight\r\nin which Frolich’s friends felt they must take part, though they all\r\nseemed to do so with some reluctance. A mad longing to join the fray\r\nalso took possession of me. With the others I helped in knocking our\r\npoor victim about, and I even heard the sound of one terrible blow\r\nwhich I struck Andre on the head, whilst he fixed his eyes on me in\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\nI relate this incident to atone for a sin which has weighed very\r\nheavily on my conscience ever since. I can compare this sad experience\r\nonly with one out of my earliest boyhood days, namely the drowning of\r\nsome puppies in a shallow pool behind my uncle’s house in Eisleben.\r\nEven to this day I cannot think of the slow death of these poor little\r\ncreatures without horror. I have never quite forgotten some of my\r\nthoughtless and reckless actions; for the sorrows of others, and in\r\nparticular those of animals, have always affected me deeply to the\r\nextent of filling me with a disgust of life.\r\n\r\nMy first love affair stands out in strong contrast against these\r\nrecollections. It was only natural that one of the young chorus ladies\r\nwith whom I had to practise daily should know how to attract my\r\nattentions. Therese Ringelmann, the daughter of a grave-digger, thanks\r\nto her beautiful soprano voice, led me to believe that I could make a\r\ngreat singer of her. After I told her of this ambitious scheme, she\r\npaid much attention to her appearance, and dressed elegantly for the\r\nrehearsals, and a row of white pearls which she wound through her hair\r\nspecially fascinated me. During the summer holidays I gave Therese\r\nregular lessons in singing, according to a method which has always\r\nremained a mystery to me ever since. I also called on her very often at\r\nher house, where, fortunately, I never met her unpleasant father, but\r\nalways her mother and her sisters. We also met in the public gardens,\r\nbut false vanity always kept me from telling my friends of our\r\nrelations. I do not know whether the fault lay with her lowly birth,\r\nher lack of education, or my own doubt about the sincerity of my\r\naffections; but in any case when, in addition to the fact that I had my\r\nreasons for being jealous, they also tried to urge me to a formal\r\nengagement, this love affair came quietly to an end.\r\n\r\nAn infinitely more genuine affair was my love for Friederike Galvani,\r\nthe daughter of a mechanic, who was undoubtedly of Italian origin. She\r\nwas very musical, and had a lovely voice; my brother had patronised her\r\nand helped her to a debut at his theatre, which test she stood\r\nbrilliantly. She was rather small, but had large dark eyes and a sweet\r\ndisposition. The first oboist of the orchestra, a good fellow as well\r\nas a clever musician, was thoroughly devoted to her. He was looked upon\r\nas her fiance, but, owing to some incident in his past, he was not\r\nallowed to visit at her parents’ house, and the marriage was not to\r\ntake place for a long time yet. When the autumn of my year in Wurzburg\r\ndrew near, I received an invitation from friends to be present at a\r\ncountry wedding at a little distance from Wurzburg; the oboist and his\r\nfiancee had also been invited. It was a jolly, though primitive affair;\r\nwe drank and danced, and I even tried my hand at violin playing, but I\r\nmust have forgotten it badly, for even with the second violin I could\r\nnot manage to satisfy the other musicians. But my success with\r\nFriederike was all the greater; we danced like mad through the many\r\ncouples of peasants until at one moment we got so excited that, losing\r\nall self-control, we embraced each other while her real lover was\r\nplaying the dance music. For the first time in my life I began to feel\r\na flattering sensation of self-respect when Friederike’s fiance, on\r\nseeing how we two flirted, accepted the situation with good grace, if\r\nnot without some sadness. I had never had the chance of thinking that I\r\ncould make a favourable impression on any young girl. I never imagined\r\nmyself good-looking, neither had I ever thought it possible that I\r\ncould attract the attention of pretty girls.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I had gradually acquired a certain self-reliance in\r\nmixing with men of my own age. Owing to the exceptional vivacity and\r\ninnate susceptibility of my nature—qualities which were brought home to\r\nme in my relations with members of my circle—I gradually became\r\nconscious of a certain power of transporting or bewildering my more\r\nindolent companions.\r\n\r\nFrom my poor oboist’s silent self-control on becoming aware of the\r\nardent advances of his betrothed towards me, I acquired, as I have\r\nsaid, the first suggestion of the fact that I might count for\r\nsomething, not only among men, but also among women. The Frankish wine\r\nhelped to bring about a state of ever greater confusion, and under the\r\ncover of its influence I at length declared myself, quite openly, to be\r\nFriederike’s lover. Ever so far into the night, in fact, when day was\r\nalready breaking, we set off home together to Wurzburg in an open\r\nwagon. This was the crowning triumph of my delightful adventure; for\r\nwhile all the others, including, in the end, the jealous oboist, slept\r\noff their debauch in the face of the dawning day, I, with my cheek\r\nagainst Friederike’s, and listening to the warbling of the larks,\r\nwatched the coming of the rising sun.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we had scarcely any idea of what had happened. A\r\ncertain sense of shame, which was not unbecoming, held us aloof from\r\none another: and yet I easily won access to Friederike’s family, and\r\nfrom that time forward was daily a welcome guest, when for some hours I\r\nwould linger in unconcealed intimate intercourse with the same domestic\r\ncircle from which the unhappy betrothed remained excluded. No word was\r\never mentioned of this last connection; never once did it even dawn\r\nupon Friederike to effect any change in the state of affairs, and it\r\nseemed to strike no one that I ought, so to speak, to take the fiance’s\r\nplace. The confiding manner in which I was received by all, and\r\nespecially by the girl herself, was exactly similar to one of Nature’s\r\ngreat processes, as, for instance, when spring steps in and winter\r\npasses silently away. Not one of them ever considered the material\r\nconsequences of the change, and this is precisely the most charming and\r\nflattering feature of this first youthful love affair, which was never\r\nto degenerate into an attitude which might give rise to suspicion or\r\nconcern. These relations ended only with my departure from Wurzburg,\r\nwhich was marked by the most touching and most tearful leavetaking.\r\n\r\nFor some time, although I kept up no correspondence, the memory of this\r\nepisode remained firmly imprinted on my mind. Two years later, while\r\nmaking a rapid journey through the old district, I once more visited\r\nFriederike: the poor child approached me utterly shamefaced. Her oboist\r\nwas still her lover, and though his position rendered marriage\r\nimpossible, the unfortunate young woman had become a mother. I have\r\nheard nothing more of her since.\r\n\r\nAmid all this traffic of love I worked hard at my opera, and, thanks to\r\nthe loving sympathy of my sister Rosalie, I was able to find the\r\nnecessary good spirits for the task. When at the commencement of the\r\nsummer my earnings as a conductor came to an end, this same sister\r\nagain made it her business loyally to provide me with ample\r\npocket-money, so that I might devote myself solely to the completion of\r\nmy work, without troubling about anything or being a burden to any one.\r\nAt a much later date I came across a letter of mine written to Rosalie\r\nin those days, which were full of a tender, almost adoring love for\r\nthat noble creature.\r\n\r\nWhen the winter was at hand my brother returned, and the theatre\r\nreopened. Truth to tell, I did not again become connected with it, but\r\nacquired a position, which was even more prominent, in the concerts of\r\nthe Musical Society in which I produced my great overture in C major,\r\nmy symphony, and eventually portions of my new opera as well. An\r\namateur with a splendid voice, Mademoiselle Friedel, sang the great\r\naria from Ada. In addition to this, a trio was given which, in one of\r\nits passages, had such a moving effect upon my brother, who took part\r\nin it, that, to his astonishment, as he himself admitted, he completely\r\nlost his cue on account of it.\r\n\r\nBy Christmas my work had come to an end, my score was written out\r\ncomplete with the most laudable neatness, and now I was to return to\r\nLeipzig for the New Year, in order to get my opera accepted by the\r\ntheatre there. On the way home I visited Nuremberg, where I stayed a\r\nweek with my sister Clara and with her husband, who were engaged at the\r\ntheatre there. I well remember how happy and comfortable I felt during\r\nthis pleasant visit to the very same relatives who a few years\r\npreviously, when I had stayed with them at Magdeburg, had been upset by\r\nmy resolve to adopt music as a calling. Now I had become a real\r\nmusician, had written a grand opera, and had already brought out many\r\nthings without coming to grief. The sense of all this was a great joy\r\nto me, while it was no less flattering to my relatives, who could not\r\nfail to see that the supposed misfortune had in the end proved to my\r\nadvantage. I was in a jolly mood and quite unrestrained—a state of mind\r\nwhich was very largely the result not only of my brother-in-law’s\r\ncheerful and sociable household, but also of the pleasant tavern life\r\nof the place. In a much more confident and elated spirit I returned to\r\nLeipzig, where I was able to lay the three huge volumes of my score\r\nbefore my highly delighted mother and sister.\r\n\r\nJust then my family was the richer for the return of my brother Julius\r\nfrom his long wanderings. He had worked a good while in Paris as a\r\ngoldsmith, and had now set up for himself in that capacity in Leipzig.\r\nHe too, like the rest, was eager to hear something out of my opera,\r\nwhich, to be sure, was not so easy, as I entirely lacked the gift of\r\nplaying anything of the sort in an easy and intelligible way. Only when\r\nI was able to work myself into a state of absolute ecstasy was it\r\npossible for me to render something with any effect. Rosalie knew that\r\nI meant it to draw a sort of declaration of love from her; but I have\r\nnever felt certain whether the embrace and the sisterly kiss which were\r\nawarded me after I had sung my great aria from Ada, were bestowed on me\r\nfrom real emotion or rather out of affectionate regard. On the other\r\nhand, the zeal with which she urged my opera on the director of the\r\ntheatre, Ringelhardt, the conductor and the manager was unmistakable,\r\nand she did it so effectually that she obtained their consent for its\r\nperformance, and that very speedily. I was particularly interested to\r\nlearn that the management immediately showed themselves eager to try to\r\nsettle the matter of the costumes for my drama: but I was astonished to\r\nhear that the choice was in favour of oriental attire, whereas I had\r\nintended, by the names I had selected, to suggest a northern character\r\nfor the setting. But it was precisely these names which they found\r\nunsuitable, as fairy personages are not seen in the North, but only in\r\nthe East; while apart from this, the original by Gozzi, which formed\r\nthe basis of the work, undoubtedly bore an oriental character. It was\r\nwith the utmost indignation that I opposed the insufferable turban and\r\ncaftan style of dress, and vehemently advocated the knightly garb worn\r\nin the early years of the Middle Ages. I then had to come to a thorough\r\nunderstanding with the conductor, Stegmayer, on the subject of my\r\nscore. He was a remarkable, short, fat man, with fair curly hair, and\r\nan exceptionally jovial disposition; he was, however, very hard to\r\nbring to a point. When over our wine we always arrived at an\r\nunderstanding very quickly, but as soon as we sat at the piano, I had\r\nto listen to the most extraordinary objections concerning the trend of\r\nwhich I was for some time extremely puzzled. As the matter was much\r\ndelayed by this vacillation, I put myself into closer communication\r\nwith the stage manager of the opera, Hauser, who at that time was much\r\nappreciated as a singer and patron of art by the people of Leipzig.\r\n\r\nWith this man, too, I had the strangest experiences: he who had\r\ncaptivated the audiences of Leipzig, more especially with his\r\nimpersonation of the barber and the Englishman in Fra Diavolo, suddenly\r\nrevealed himself in his own house as the most fanatical adherent of the\r\nmost old-fashioned music. I listened with astonishment to the scarcely\r\nveiled contempt with which he treated even Mozart, and the only thing\r\nhe seemed to regret was that we had no operas by Sebastian Bach. After\r\nhe had explained to me that dramatic music had not actually been\r\nwritten yet, and that properly speaking Gluck alone had shown any\r\nability for it, he proceeded to what seemed an exhaustive examination\r\nof my own opera, concerning which all I had wished to hear from him was\r\nwhether it was fit to be performed. Instead of this, however, his\r\nobject seemed to be to point out the failure of my purpose in every\r\nnumber. I sweated blood under the unparalleled torture of going through\r\nmy work with this man; and I told my mother and sister of my grave\r\ndepression. All these delays had already succeeded in making it\r\nimpossible to perform my opera at the date originally fixed, and now it\r\nwas postponed until August of the current year (1834).\r\n\r\nAn incident which I shall never forget inspired me with fresh courage.\r\nOld Bierey, an experienced and excellent musician, and in his day a\r\nsuccessful composer, who, thanks more particularly to his long practice\r\nas a conductor at the Breslau theatre, had acquired a perfectly\r\npractical knowledge of such things, was then living at Leipzig, and was\r\na good friend of my people. My mother and sister begged him to give his\r\nopinion about the fitness of my opera for the stage, and I duly\r\nsubmitted the score to him. I cannot say how deeply affected and\r\nimpressed I was to see this old gentleman appear one day among my\r\nrelatives, and to hear him declare with genuine enthusiasm that he\r\nsimply could not understand how so young a man could have composed such\r\na score. His remarks concerning the greatness which he had recognised\r\nin my talent were really irresistible, and positively amazed me. When\r\nasked whether he considered the work presentable and calculated to\r\nproduce an effect, he declared his only regret was that he was no\r\nlonger at the head of a theatre, because, had he been, he would have\r\nthought himself extremely lucky to secure such a man as myself\r\npermanently for his enterprise. At this announcement my family was\r\novercome with joy, and their feelings were all the more justified\r\nseeing that, as they all knew, Bierey was by no means an amiable\r\nromancer, but a practical musician well seasoned by a life full of\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe delay was now borne with better spirits, and for a long time I was\r\nable to wait hopefully for what the future might bring. Among other\r\nthings, I now began to enjoy the company of a new friend in the person\r\nof Laube, who at that time, although I had not set his Kosziusko to\r\nmusic, was at the zenith of his fame. The first portion of his novel,\r\nYoung Europe, the form of which was epistolary, had appeared, and had a\r\nmost stimulating effect on me, more particularly in conjunction with\r\nall the youthful hopefulness which at that time pulsated in my veins.\r\nThough his teaching was essentially only a repetition of that in\r\nHeinse’s Ardinghello, the forces that then surged in young breasts were\r\ngiven full and eloquent expression. The guiding spirit of this tendency\r\nwas followed in literary criticism, which was aimed mainly at the\r\nsupposed or actual incapacity of the semi-classical occupants of our\r\nvarious literary thrones. Without the slightest mercy the pedants,[6] \r\namong whom Tieck for one was numbered, were treated as sheer\r\nencumbrances and hindrances to the rise of a new literature. That which\r\nled to a remarkable revulsion of my feelings with regard to those\r\nGerman composers who hitherto had been admired and respected, was\r\npartly the influence of these critical skirmishes, and the luring\r\nsprightliness of their tone; but mainly the impression made by a fresh\r\nvisit of Schroder-Devrient to Leipzig, when her rendering of Borneo in\r\nBellini’s Romeo and Juliet carried every one by storm. The effect of it\r\nwas not to be compared with anything that had been witnessed\r\ntheretofore. To see the daring, romantic figure of the youthful lover\r\nagainst a background of such obviously shallow and empty music prompted\r\none, at all events, to meditate doubtfully upon the cause of the great\r\nlack of effect in solid German music as it had been applied hitherto to\r\nthe drama. Without for the moment plunging too deeply into this\r\nmeditation, I allowed myself to be borne along with the current of my\r\nyouthful feelings, then roused to ardour, and turned involuntarily to\r\nthe task of working off all that brooding seriousness which in my\r\nearlier years had driven me to such pathetic mysticism.\r\n\r\n [6] _Zöpfe_ in the German text.—TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Pohlenz had not done by his conducting of the Ninth Symphony, what\r\nthe Vienna Conservatoire, Dionys Weber, and many other clumsy\r\nperformances (which had led me to regard classical music as absolutely\r\ncolourless) had not fully accomplished, was achieved by the\r\ninconceivable charm of the most unclassical Italian music, thanks to\r\nthe wonderful, thrilling, and entrancing impersonation of Romeo by\r\nSchroder-Devrient. What effect such powerful, and as regards their\r\ncauses, incomprehensible, effects had upon my opinion was shown in the\r\nfrivolous way in which I was able to contrive a short criticism of\r\nWeber’s Euryanthe for the Elegante Zeitung. This opera had been\r\nperformed by the Leipzig company shortly before the appearance of\r\nSchroder-Devrient: cold and colourless performers, among whom the\r\nsinger in the title-role, appearing in the wilderness with the full\r\nsleeves which were then the pink of fashion, is still a disagreeable\r\nmemory. Very laboriously, and without verve, but simply with the object\r\nof satisfying the demands of classical rules, this company did its\r\nutmost to dispel even the enthusiastic impressions of Weber’s music\r\nwhich I had formed in my youth. I did not know what answer to make to a\r\nbrother critic of Laube’s, when he pointed out to me the laboured\r\ncharacter of this operatic performance, as soon as he was able to\r\ncontrast it with the entrancing effect of that Romeo evening. Here I\r\nfound myself confronted with a problem, the solving of which I was just\r\nat that time disposed to take as easily as possible, and displayed my\r\ncourage by discarding all prejudice, and that daringly, in the short\r\ncriticism just mentioned in which I simply scoffed at Euryanthe. Just\r\nas I had had my season of wild oat sowing as a student, so now I boldly\r\nrushed into the same courses in the development of my artistic taste.\r\n\r\nIt was May, and beautiful spring weather, and a pleasure trip that I\r\nnow undertook with a friend into the promised land of my youthful\r\nromance, Bohemia, was destined to bring the unrestrained\r\n‘Young-European’ mood in me to full maturity. This friend was Theodor\r\nApel. I had known him a long while, and had always felt particularly\r\nflattered by the fact that I had won his hearty affection; for, as the\r\nson of the gifted master of metre and imitator of Greek forms of\r\npoetry, August Apel, I felt that admiring deference for him which I had\r\nnever yet been able to bestow upon the descendant of a famous man.\r\nBeing well-to-do and of a good family, his friendship gave me such\r\nopportunities of coming into touch with the easy circumstances of the\r\nupper classes as were not of frequent occurrence in my station of life.\r\nWhile my mother, for instance, regarded my association with this highly\r\nrespectable family with great satisfaction, I for my part was extremely\r\ngratified at the thought of the cordiality with which I was received in\r\nsuch circles.\r\n\r\nApel’s earnest wish was to become a poet, and I took it for granted\r\nthat he had all that was needed for such a calling; above all, what\r\nseemed to me so important, the complete freedom that his considerable\r\nfortune assured him by liberating him from all need of earning his\r\nliving or of adopting a profession for a livelihood. Strange to say,\r\nhis mother, who on the death of his distinguished father had married a\r\nLeipzig lawyer, was very anxious about the vocation he should choose,\r\nand wished her son to make a fine career in the law, as she was not at\r\nall disposed to favour his poetical gifts. And it was to her attempts\r\nto convert me to her view, in order that by my influence I might avert\r\nthe calamity of a second poet in the family, in the person of the son,\r\nthat I owed the specially friendly relations that obtained between\r\nherself and me. All her suggestions succeeded in doing, however, was to\r\nstimulate me, even more than my own favourable opinion of his talent\r\ncould, to confirm my friend in his desire to be a poet, and thus to\r\nsupport him in his rebellious attitude towards his family.\r\n\r\nHe was not displeased at this. As he was also studying music and\r\ncomposed quite nicely, I succeeded in being on terms of the greatest\r\nintimacy with him. The fact that he had spent the very year in which I\r\nhad sunk into the lowest depths of undergraduate madness, studying at\r\nHeidelberg and not at Leipzig, had kept him unsullied by any share in\r\nmy strange excesses, and when we now met again at Leipzig, in the\r\nspring of 1834, the only thing that we still had in common was the\r\naesthetic aspiration of our lives, which we now strove by way of\r\nexperiment to divert into the direction of the enjoyment of life.\r\nGladly would we have flung ourselves into lively adventures if only the\r\nconditions of our environment and of the whole middle-class world in\r\nwhich we lived had in any way admitted of such things. Despite all the\r\npromptings of our instincts, however, we got no further than planning\r\nthis excursion to Bohemia. At all events, it was something that we made\r\nthe journey not by the post, but in our own carriage, and our genuine\r\npleasure continued to lie in the fact that at Teplitz, for instance, we\r\ndaily took long drives in a fine carriage. When in the evening we had\r\nsupped off trout at the Wilhelmsburg, drunk good Czernosek wine with\r\nBilin water, and duly excited ourselves over Hoffmann, Beethoven,\r\nShakespeare, Heinse’s Ardinghello, and other matters, and then, with\r\nour limbs comfortably outstretched in our elegant carriage, drove back\r\nin the summer twilight to the ‘King of Prussia,’ where we occupied the\r\nlarge balcony-room on the first floor, we felt that we had spent the\r\nday like young gods, and for sheer exuberance could think of nothing\r\nbetter to do than to indulge in the most frightful quarrels which,\r\nespecially when the windows were open, would collect numbers of alarmed\r\nlisteners in the square before the inn.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning I stole away from my friend in order to take my\r\nbreakfast alone at the ‘Schlackenburg,’ and also to seize an\r\nopportunity of jotting down the plan of a new operatic composition in\r\nmy note-book. With this end in view, I had mastered the subject of\r\nShakespeare’s Measure for Measure, which, in accordance with my present\r\nmood, I soon transformed pretty freely into a libretto entitled\r\nLiebesverbot. Young Europe and Ardinghello, and the strange frame of\r\nmind into which I had fallen with regard to classical operatic music,\r\nfurnished me with the keynote of my conception, which was directed more\r\nparticularly against puritanical hypocrisy, and which thus tended\r\nboldly to exalt ‘unrestrained sensuality.’ I took care to understand\r\nthe grave Shakespearean theme only in this sense. I could see only the\r\ngloomy strait-laced viceroy, his heart aflame with the most passionate\r\nlove for the beautiful novice, who, while she beseeches him to pardon\r\nher brother condemned to death for illicit love, at the same time\r\nkindles the most dangerous fire in the stubborn Puritan’s breast by\r\ninfecting him with the lovely warmth of her human emotion.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these powerful features are so richly developed in\r\nShakespeare’s creation only in order that, in the end, they may be\r\nweighed all the more gravely in the scales of justice, was no concern\r\nof mine: all I cared about was to expose the sinfulness of hypocrisy\r\nand the unnaturalness of such cruel moral censure. Thus I completely\r\ndropped Measure for Measure, and made the hypocrite be brought to\r\njustice only by the avenging power of love. I transferred the theme\r\nfrom the fabulous city of Vienna to the capital of sunny Sicily, in\r\nwhich a German viceroy, indignant at the inconceivably loose morals of\r\nthe people, attempts to introduce a puritanical reform, and comes\r\nmiserably to grief over it. Die Stumme von Portici probably contributed\r\nto some extent to this theme, as did also certain memories of Die\r\nSizilianische Vesper. When I remember that at last even the gentle\r\nSicilian Bellini constituted a factor in this composition, I cannot, to\r\nbe sure, help smiling at the strange medley in which the most\r\nextraordinary misunderstandings here took shape.\r\n\r\nThis remained for the present a mere draft. Studies from life destined\r\nfor my work were first to be carried out on this delightful excursion\r\nto Bohemia. I led my friend in triumph to Prague, in the hope of\r\nsecuring the same impressions for him which had stirred me so\r\nprofoundly when I was there. We met my fair friends in the city itself;\r\nfor, owing to the death of old Count Pachta, material changes had taken\r\nplace in the family, and the surviving daughters no longer went to\r\nPravonin. My behaviour was full of arrogance, and by means of it I\r\ndoubtless wished to vent a certain capricious lust of revenge for the\r\nfeelings of bitterness with which I had taken leave of this circle some\r\nyears previously. My friend was well received. The changed family\r\ncircumstances forced the charming girls ever more and more imperatively\r\nto come to some decision as to their future, and a wealthy bourgeois,\r\nthough not exactly in trade himself, but in possession of ample means,\r\nseemed to the anxious mother, at all events, a good adviser. Without\r\neither showing or feeling any malice in the matter, I expressed my\r\npleasure at the sight of the strange confusion caused by Theodor’s\r\nintroduction into the family by the merriest and wildest jests: for my\r\nonly intercourse with the ladies consisted purely of jokes and friendly\r\nchaff. They could not understand how it was that I had altered so\r\nstrangely. There was no longer any of that love of wrangling, that rage\r\nfor instructing, and that zeal in converting in me which formerly they\r\nhad found so irritating. But at the same time not a sensible word could\r\nI be made to utter, and they who were now wanting to talk over many\r\nthings seriously could get nothing out of me save the wildest\r\ntomfoolery. As on this occasion, in my character of an uncaged bird, I\r\nboldly allowed myself many a liberty against which they felt themselves\r\npowerless, my exuberant spirits were excited all the more when my\r\nfriend, who was led away by my example, tried to imitate me—a thing\r\nthey took in very bad part from him.\r\n\r\nOnly once was there any attempt at seriousness between us: I was\r\nsitting at the piano, and was listening to my companion, who was\r\ntelling the ladies that in a conversation at the hotel I had found\r\noccasion to express myself most warmly to some one who appeared to be\r\nsurprised on hearing of the domestic and industrious qualities of my\r\nlady friends. I was deeply moved when, as the outcome of my companion’s\r\nremarks, I gathered what unpleasant experiences the poor things had\r\nalready been through: for what seemed to me a very natural action on my\r\npart, appeared to fill them with unexpected pleasure. Jenny, for\r\ninstance, came up to me and hugged me with great warmth. By general\r\nconsent I was now granted the right of behaving with almost studied\r\nrudeness, and I replied even to Jenny’s warm outburst only with my\r\nusual banter.\r\n\r\nIn our hotel, the ‘Black Horse,’ which was so famous in those days, I\r\nfound the playground in which I was able to carry the mischievous\r\nspirit not exhausted at the Pachta’s house to the point of\r\nrecklessness. Out of the most accidental material in table and\r\ntravelling guests we succeeded in gathering a company around us which\r\nallowed us, until far into the night, to lead it into the most\r\ninconceivable follies. To all this I was incited more particularly by\r\nthe personality of a very timid and undersized business man from\r\nFrankfort on the Oder, who longed to seem of a daring disposition; and\r\nhis presence stimulated me, if only owing to the remarkable chance it\r\ngave me of coming into contact with some one who was at home in\r\nFrankfort ‘on the Oder.’ Any one who knows how things then stood in\r\nAustria can form some idea of my recklessness when I say that I once\r\nwent so far as to cause our symposium in the public room to bellow the\r\nMarseillaise out loud into the night. Therefore, when after this heroic\r\nexploit was over, and while I was undressing, I clambered on the outer\r\nledges of the windows from one room to the other on the second floor, I\r\nnaturally horrified those who did not know of the love of acrobatic\r\nfeats which I had cultivated in my earliest boyhood.\r\n\r\nEven if I had exposed myself without fear to such dangers, I was soon\r\nsobered down next morning by a summons from the police. When, in\r\naddition to this, I recalled the singing of the Marseillaise, I was\r\nfilled with the gravest fears. After having been detained at the\r\nstation a long time, owing to a strange misunderstanding, the upshot of\r\nit was that the inspector who was told off to examine me found that\r\nthere was not sufficient time left for a serious hearing, and, to my\r\ngreat relief, I was allowed to go after replying to a few harmless\r\nquestions concerning the intended length of my stay. Nevertheless, we\r\nthought it advisable not to yield to the temptation of playing any more\r\npranks beneath the spread wings of the double eagle.\r\n\r\nBy means of a circuitous route into which we were led by our insatiable\r\nlonging for adventures—adventures which, as a matter of fact, occurred\r\nonly in our imagination, and which to all intents and purposes were but\r\nmodest diversions on the road—we at length got back to Leipzig. And\r\nwith this return home the really cheerful period of my life as a youth\r\ndefinitely closed. If, up to that time, I had not been free from\r\nserious errors and moments of passion, it was only now that care cast\r\nits first shadow across my path.\r\n\r\nMy family had anxiously awaited my return in order to inform me that\r\nthe post of conductor had been offered to me by the Magdeburg Theatre\r\nCompany. This company during the current summer month was performing at\r\na watering place called Lauchstadt. The manager could not get on with\r\nan incompetent conductor that had been sent to him, and in his\r\nextremity had applied to Leipzig in the hope of getting a substitute\r\nforthwith. Stegmayer, the conductor, who had no inclination to practise\r\nmy score Feen during the hot summer weather, as he had promised to do,\r\npromptly recommended me for the post, and in that way really managed to\r\nshake off a very troublesome tormentor. For although, on the one hand,\r\nI really desired to be able to abandon myself freely and without\r\nrestraint to the torrent of adventures that constitute the artist’s\r\nlife, yet a longing for independence, which could be won only by my\r\nearning my own living, had been greatly strengthened in me by the state\r\nof my affairs. Albeit, I had the feeling that a solid basis for the\r\ngratification of this desire was not to be laid in Lauchstadt; nor did\r\nI find it easy to assist the plot concocted against the production of\r\nmy Feen. I therefore determined to make a preliminary visit to the\r\nplace just to see how things stood.\r\n\r\nThis little watering-place had, in the days of Goethe and Schiller,\r\nacquired a very wide reputation, its wooden theatre had been built\r\naccording to the design of the former, and the first performance of the\r\nBraut von Messina had been given there. But although I repeated all\r\nthis to myself, the place made me feel rather doubtful. I asked for the\r\nhouse of the director of the theatre. He proved to be out, but a small\r\ndirty boy, his son, was told to take me to the theatre to find ‘Papa.’\r\nPapa, however, met us on the way. He was an elderly man; he wore a\r\ndressing-gown, and on his head a cap. His delight at greeting me was\r\ninterrupted by complaints about a serious indisposition, for which his\r\nson was to fetch him a cordial from a shop close by. Before despatching\r\nthe boy on this errand he pressed a real silver penny into his hand\r\nwith a certain ostentation which was obviously for my benefit. This\r\nperson was Heinrich Bethmann, surviving husband of the famous actress\r\nof that name, who, having lived in the heyday of the German stage, had\r\nwon the favour of the King of Prussia; and won it so lastingly, that\r\nlong after her death it had continued to be extended to her spouse. He\r\nalways drew a nice pension from the Prussian court, and permanently\r\nenjoyed its support without ever being able to forfeit its protection\r\nby his irregular and dissipated ways.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I am speaking he had sunk to his lowest, owing to\r\ncontinued theatre management. His speech and manners revealed the\r\nsugary refinement of a bygone day, while all that he did and everything\r\nabout him testified to the most shameful neglect. He took me back to\r\nhis house, where he presented me to his second wife, who, crippled in\r\none foot, lay on an extraordinary couch while an elderly bass,\r\nconcerning whose excessive devotion Bethmann had already complained to\r\nme quite openly, smoked his pipe beside her. From there the director\r\ntook me to his stage manager, who lived in the same house.\r\n\r\nWith the latter, who was just engaged in a consultation about the\r\nrepertory with the theatre attendant, a toothless old skeleton, he left\r\nme to settle the necessary arrangements. As soon as Bethmann had gone,\r\nSchmale, the stage manager, shrugged his shoulders and smiled, assuring\r\nme that that was just the way of the director, to put everything on his\r\nback and trouble himself about nothing. There he had been sitting for\r\nover an hour, discussing with Kroge what should be put on next Sunday:\r\nit was all very well his starting Don Juan, but how could he get a\r\nrehearsal carried out, when the Merseburg town bandsmen, who formed the\r\norchestra, would not come over on Saturday to rehearse?\r\n\r\nAll the time Schmale kept reaching out through the open window to a\r\ncherry tree from which he picked and persistently ate the fruit,\r\nejecting the stones with a disagreeable noise. Now it was this last\r\ncircumstance in particular which decided me; for, strange to say, I\r\nhave an innate aversion from fruit. I informed the stage manager that\r\nhe need not trouble at all about Don Juan for Sunday, since for my\r\npart, if they had reckoned on my making my first appearance at this\r\nperformance, I must anyhow disappoint the director, as I had no choice\r\nbut to return at once to Leipzig, where I had to put my affairs in\r\norder. This polite manner of tendering my absolute refusal to accept\r\nthe appointment—a conclusion I had quickly arrived at in my own\r\nmind—forced me to practise some dissimulation, and made it necessary\r\nfor me to appear as if I really had some other purpose in coming to\r\nLauchstadt. This pretence in itself was quite unnecessary, seeing that\r\nI was quite determined never to return there again.\r\n\r\nPeople offered to help me in finding a lodging, and a young actor whom\r\nI had chanced to know at Wurzburg undertook to be my guide in the\r\nmatter. While he was taking me to the best lodging he knew, he told me\r\nthat presently he would do me the kindness of making me the housemate\r\nof the prettiest and nicest girl to be found in the place at the time.\r\nShe was the junior lead of the company, Mademoiselle Minna Planer, of\r\nwhom doubtless I had already heard.\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, the promised damsel met us at the door of the\r\nhouse in question. Her appearance and bearing formed the most striking\r\ncontrast possible to all the unpleasant impressions of the theatre\r\nwhich it had been my lot to receive on this fateful morning. Looking\r\nvery charming and fresh, the young actress’s general manner and\r\nmovements were full of a certain majesty and grave assurance which lent\r\nan agreeable and captivating air of dignity to her otherwise pleasant\r\nexpression. Her scrupulously clean and tidy dress completed the\r\nstartling effect of the unexpected encounter. After I had been\r\nintroduced to her in the hall as the new conductor, and after she had\r\ndone regarding with astonishment the stranger who seemed so young for\r\nsuch a title, she recommended me kindly to the landlady of the house,\r\nand begged that I might be well looked after; whereupon she walked\r\nproudly and serenely across the street to her rehearsal.\r\n\r\nI engaged a room on the spot, agreed to Don Juan for Sunday, regretted\r\ngreatly that I had not brought my luggage with me from Leipzig, and\r\nhastened to return thither as quickly as possible in order to get back\r\nto Lauchstadt all the sooner. The die was cast. The serious side of\r\nlife at once confronted me in the form of significant experiences. At\r\nLeipzig I had to take a furtive leave of Laube. At the instance of\r\nPrussia he had been warned off Saxon soil, and he half guessed at the\r\nmeaning which was to be attached to this move. The time of undisguised\r\nreaction against the Liberal movement of the early ‘thirties had set\r\nin: the fact that Laube was concerned in no sort of political work, but\r\nhad devoted himself merely to literary activity, always aiming simply\r\nat aesthetic objects, made the action of the police quite\r\nincomprehensible to us for the time being. The disgusting ambiguity\r\nwith which the Leipzig authorities answered all his questions as to the\r\ncause of his expulsion soon gave him the strongest suspicions as to\r\nwhat their intentions towards him actually were.\r\n\r\nLeipzig, as the scene of his literary labours, being inestimably\r\nprecious, it mattered greatly to him to keep within reach of it. My\r\nfriend Apel owned a fine estate on Prussian soil, within but a few\r\nhours’ distance of Leipzig, and we conceived the wish of seeing Laube\r\nhospitably harboured there. My friend, who without infringing the legal\r\nstipulations was in a position to give the persecuted man a place of\r\nrefuge, immediately assented, and with great readiness, to our desire,\r\nbut confessed to us next day, after having communicated with his\r\nfamily, that he thought he might incur some unpleasantnesses if he\r\nentertained Laube. At this the latter smiled, and in a manner I shall\r\nnever forget, though I have noticed in the course of my life that the\r\nexpression which I then saw in his face was one which has often flitted\r\nover my own features. He took his leave, and in a short time we heard\r\nthat he had been arrested, owing to having undertaken fresh proceedings\r\nagainst former members of the Burschenschaft (Students’ League), and\r\nhad been lodged in the municipal prison at Berlin. I had thus had two\r\nexperiences which weighed me down like lead, so I packed my scanty\r\nportmanteau, took leave of my mother and sister, and, with a stout\r\nheart, started on my career as a conductor.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to look upon the little room under Minna’s lodging\r\nas my new home, I was forced also to make the best of Bethmann’s\r\ntheatrical enterprise. As a matter of fact, a performance of Don Juan\r\nwas given at once, for the director, who prided himself on being a\r\nconnoisseur of things artistic, suggested that opera to me as one with\r\nwhich it would be wise for an aspiring young artist, of a good family,\r\nto make his debut. Despite the fact that, apart from some of my own\r\ninstrumental compositions, I had never yet conducted, and least of all\r\nin opera, the rehearsal and the performance went off fairly well. Only\r\nonce or twice did discrepancies appear in the recitative of Donna Anna;\r\nyet this did not involve me in any kind of hostility, and when I took\r\nmy place unabashed and calm for the production of Lumpaci Vagabundus,\r\nwhich I had practised very thoroughly, the people generally seemed to\r\nhave gained full confidence in the theatre’s new acquisition.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I submitted without bitterness and even with some\r\ncheerfulness to this unworthy use of my musical talent, was due less to\r\nmy taste being at this period, as I called it, in its salad days, than\r\nto my intercourse with Minna Planer, who was employed in that magic\r\ntrifle as the Amorous Fairy. Indeed, in the midst of this dust-cloud of\r\nfrivolity and vulgarity, she always seemed very much like a fairy, the\r\nreasons of whose descent into this giddy whirl, which of a truth seemed\r\nneither to carry her away nor even to affect her, remained an absolute\r\nmystery. For while I could discover nothing in the opera singers save\r\nthe familiar stage caricatures and grimaces, this fair actress differed\r\nwholly from those about her in her unaffected soberness and dainty\r\nmodesty, as also in the absence of all theatrical pretence and\r\nstiltedness. There was only one young man whom I could place beside\r\nMinna on the ground of qualities like those I recognised in her. This\r\nfellow was Friedrich Schmitt, who had only just adopted the stage as a\r\ncareer in the hope of making a ‘hit’ in opera, to which, as the\r\npossessor of an excellent tenor voice, he felt himself called. He too\r\ndiffered from the rest of the company, especially in the earnestness\r\nwhich he brought to bear upon his studies and his work in general: the\r\nsoulful manly pitch of his chest voice, his clear, noble enunciation\r\nand intelligent rendering of his words, have always remained as\r\nstandards in my memory. Owing to the fact that he was wholly devoid of\r\ntheatrical talent, and acted clumsily and awkwardly, a check was soon\r\nput to his progress, but he always remained dear to me as a clever and\r\noriginal man of trustworthy and upright character—my only associate.\r\n\r\nBut my dealings with my kind housemate soon became a cherished habit,\r\nwhile she returned the ingenuously impetuous advances of the conductor\r\nof one-and-twenty with a certain tolerant astonishment which, remote as\r\nit was from all coquetry and ulterior motives, soon made familiar and\r\nfriendly intercourse possible with her. When, one evening, I returned\r\nlate to my ground-floor room, by climbing through the window, for I had\r\nno latch-key, the noise of my entry brought Minna to her window just\r\nover mine. Standing on my window ledge I begged her to allow me to bid\r\nher good-night once more. She had not the slightest objection to this,\r\nbut declared it must be done from the window, as she always had her\r\ndoor locked by the people of the house, and nobody could get in that\r\nway. She kindly facilitated the handshake by leaning far out of her\r\nwindow, so that I could take her hand as I stood on my ledge. When\r\nlater on I had an attack of erysipelas, from which I often suffered,\r\nand with my face all swollen and frightfully distorted concealed myself\r\nfrom the world in my gloomy room, Minna visited me repeatedly, nursed\r\nme, and assured me that my distorted features did not matter in the\r\nleast. On recovering, I paid her a visit and complained of a rash that\r\nhad remained round my mouth, and which seemed so unpleasant that I\r\napologised for showing it to her. This also she made light of. Then I\r\ninferred she would not give me a kiss, whereupon she at once gave me\r\npractical proof that she did not shrink from that either.\r\n\r\nThis was all done with a friendly serenity and composure that had\r\nsomething almost motherly about it, and it was free from all suggestion\r\nof frivolity or of heartlessness. In a few weeks the company had to\r\nleave Lauchstadt to proceed to Rudolstadt and fulfil a special\r\nengagement there. I was particularly anxious to make this journey,\r\nwhich in those days was an arduous undertaking, in Minna’s company, and\r\nif only I had succeeded in getting my well-earned salary duly paid by\r\nBethmann, nothing would have hindered the fulfilment of my wish. But in\r\nthis matter I encountered exceptional difficulties, which in the course\r\nof eventful years grew in chronic fashion into the strangest of\r\nailments. Even at Lauchstadt I had discovered that there was only one\r\nman who drew his salary in full, namely the bass Kneisel, whom I had\r\nseen smoking his pipe beside the couch of the director’s lame wife. I\r\nwas assured that if I cared greatly about getting some of my wages from\r\ntime to time, I could obtain this favour only by paying court to Mme.\r\nBethmann. This time I preferred once more to appeal to my family for\r\nhelp, and therefore travelled to Rudolstadt through Leipzig, where, to\r\nthe sad astonishment of my mother, I had to replenish my coffer with\r\nthe necessary supplies. On the way to Leipzig I had travelled with Apel\r\nthrough his estate, he having fetched me from Lauchstadt for the\r\npurpose. His arrival was fixed in my memory by a noisy banquet which my\r\nwealthy friend gave at the hotel in my honour. It was on this occasion\r\nthat I and one of the other guests succeeded in completely destroying a\r\nhuge, massively built Dutch-tile stove, such as we had in our room at\r\nthe inn. Next morning none of us could understand how it had happened.\r\n\r\nIt was on this journey to Rudolstadt that I first passed through\r\nWeimar, where on a rainy day I strolled with curiosity, but without\r\nemotion, towards Goethe’s house. I had pictured something rather\r\ndifferent, and thought I should experience livelier impressions from\r\nthe active theatre life of Rudolstadt, to which I felt strongly\r\nattracted. In spite of the fact that I was not to be conductor myself,\r\nthis post having been entrusted to the leader of the royal orchestra,\r\nwho had been specially engaged for our performances, yet I was so fully\r\noccupied with rehearsals for the many operas and musical comedies\r\nrequired to regale the frivolous public of the principality that I\r\nfound no leisure for excursions into the charming regions of this\r\nlittle land. In addition to these severe and ill-paid labours, two\r\npassions held me chained during the six weeks of my stay in Rudolstadt.\r\nThese were, first, a longing to write the libretto of Liebesverbot; and\r\nsecondly, my growing attachment to Minna. It is true, I sketched out a\r\nmusical composition about this time, a symphony in E major, whose first\r\nmovement (3/4 time) I completed as a separate piece. As regards style\r\nand design, this work was suggested by Beethoven’s Seventh and Eighth\r\nSymphonies, and, so far as I can remember, I should have had no need to\r\nbe ashamed of it, had I been able to complete it, or keep the part I\r\nhad actually finished. But I had already begun at this time to form the\r\nopinion that, to produce anything fresh and truly noteworthy in the\r\nrealm of symphony, and according to Beethoven’s methods, was an\r\nimpossibility. Whereas opera, to which I felt inwardly drawn, though I\r\nhad no real example I wished to copy, presented itself to my mind in\r\nvaried and alluring shapes as a most fascinating form of art. Thus,\r\namid manifold and passionate agitations, and in the few leisure hours\r\nwhich were left to me, I completed the greater part of my operatic\r\npoem, taking infinitely more pains, both as regards words and\r\nversification, than with the text of my earlier Feen. Moreover, I found\r\nmyself possessed of incomparably greater assurance in the arrangement\r\nand partial invention of situations than when writing that earlier\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I now began for the first time to experience the\r\ncares and worries of a lover’s jealousy. A change, to me inexplicable,\r\nmanifested itself in Minna’s hitherto unaffected and gentle manner\r\ntowards me. It appears that my artless solicitations for her favour, by\r\nwhich at that time I meant nothing serious, and in which a man of the\r\nworld would merely have seen the exuberance of a youthful and easily\r\nsatisfied infatuation, had given rise to certain remarks and comments\r\nupon the popular actress. I was astonished to learn, first from her\r\nreserved manner, and later from her own lips, that she felt compelled\r\nto inquire into the seriousness of my intentions, and to consider their\r\nconsequences. She was at that time, as I had already discovered, on\r\nvery intimate terms with a young nobleman, whose acquaintance I first\r\nmade in Lauchstadt, where he used to visit her. I had already realised\r\non that occasion that he was unfeignedly and cordially attached to her;\r\nin fact, in the circle of her friends she was regarded as engaged to\r\nHerr von O., although it was obvious that marriage was out of the\r\nquestion, as the young lover was quite without means, and owing to the\r\nhigh standing of his family it was essential that he should sacrifice\r\nhimself to a marriage of convenience, both on account of his social\r\nposition and of the career which he would have to adopt. During this\r\nstay at Rudolstadt Minna appears to have gathered certain information\r\non this point which troubled and depressed her, thus rendering her more\r\ninclined to treat my impetuous attempts at courtship with cool reserve.\r\n\r\nAfter mature deliberation I recognised that, in any case, Young Europe,\r\nArdinghello, and Liebesverbot could not be produced at Rudolstadt; but\r\nit was a very different matter for the Fee Amorosa, with its merry\r\ntheatrical mood, and an Ehrlicher Burger Kind to seek a decent\r\nlivelihood. Therefore, greatly discouraged, I proceeded to accentuate\r\nthe more extravagant situations of my Liebesverbot by rioting with a\r\nfew comrades in the sausage-scented atmosphere of the Rudolstadt\r\nVogelwiese. At this time my troubles again brought me more or less into\r\ncontact with the vice of gambling, although on this occasion it only\r\ncast temporary fetters about me in the very harmless form of the dice\r\nand roulette-tables out on the open market-place.\r\n\r\nWe were looking forward to the time when we should leave Rudolstadt for\r\nthe half-yearly winter season at the capital, Magdeburg, mainly because\r\nI should there resume my place at the head of the orchestra, and might\r\nin any case count on a better reward for my musical efforts. But before\r\nreturning to Magdeburg I had to endure a trying interval at Bernburg,\r\nwhere Bethmann, the director, in addition to his other undertakings,\r\nhad also promised sundry theatrical performances. During our brief stay\r\nin the town I had to arrange for the presentation, with a mere fraction\r\nof the company, of several operas, which were again to be conducted by\r\nthe royal conductor of the place. But in addition to these professional\r\nlabours, I had to endure such a meagre, ill-provided and grievously\r\nfarcical existence as was enough to disgust me, if not for ever, at any\r\nrate for the time being, with the wretched profession of a theatrical\r\nconductor. Yet I survived even this, and Magdeburg was destined to lead\r\nme eventually to the real glory of my adopted profession.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of sitting in command at the very conductor’s desk from\r\nwhich, not many years before, the great master Kuhnlein had so moved\r\nthe perplexed young enthusiast by the weighty wisdom of his musical\r\ndirectorship, was not without its charm for me, and, indeed, I very\r\nquickly succeeded in obtaining perfect confidence in conducting an\r\norchestra. I was soon a persona grata with the excellent musicians of\r\nthe orchestra. Their splendid combination in spirited overtures, which,\r\nespecially towards the finale, I generally took at an unheard-of speed,\r\noften earned for us all the intoxicating applause of the public. The\r\nachievements of my fiery and often exuberant zeal won me recognition\r\nfrom the singers, and were greeted by the audience with rapturous\r\nappreciation. As in Magdeburg, at least in those days, the art of\r\ntheatrical criticism was but slightly developed, this universal\r\nsatisfaction was a great encouragement, and at the end of the first\r\nthree months of my Magdeburg conductorship I felt sustained by the\r\nflattering and comforting assurance that I was one of the bigwigs of\r\nopera. Under these circumstances, Schmale, the stage manager, who has\r\nbeen my good friend ever since, proposed a special gala performance for\r\nNew Year’s Day, which he felt sure would be a triumph. I was to compose\r\nthe necessary music. This was very speedily done; a rousing overture,\r\nseveral melodramas and choruses were all greeted with enthusiasm, and\r\nbrought us such ample applause that we repeated the performance with\r\ngreat success, although such repetitions after the actual gala day were\r\nquite contrary to usage.\r\n\r\nWith the new year (1835) there came a decisive turning-point in my\r\nlife. After the rupture between Minna and myself at Rudolstadt, we had\r\nbeen to some extent lost to one another; but our friendship was resumed\r\non our meeting again in Magdeburg; this time, however, it remained cool\r\nand purposely indifferent. When she first appeared in the town, a year\r\nbefore, her beauty had attracted considerable notice, and I now learned\r\nthat she was the object of great attention from several young noblemen,\r\nand had shown herself not unmoved by the compliment implied by their\r\nvisits. Although her reputation, thanks to her absolute discretion and\r\nself-respect, remained beyond reproach, my objection to her receiving\r\nsuch attentions grew very strong, owing possibly, in some degree, to\r\nthe memory of the sorrows I had endured in Pachta’s house in Prague.\r\nAlthough Minna assured me that the conduct of these gentlemen was much\r\nmore discreet and decent than that of theatre-goers of the bourgeois\r\nclass, and especially than that of certain young musical conductors,\r\nshe never succeeded in soothing the bitterness and insistence with\r\nwhich I protested against her acceptance of such attentions. So we\r\nspent three unhappy months in ever-increasing estrangement, and at the\r\nsame time, in half-frantic despair, I pretended to be fond of the most\r\nundesirable associates, and acted in every way with such blatant levity\r\nthat Minna, as she told me afterwards, was filled with the deepest\r\nanxiety and solicitude concerning me. Moreover, as the ladies of the\r\nopera company were not slow to pay court to their youthful conductor,\r\nand especially as one young woman, whose reputation was not spotless,\r\nopenly set her cap at me, this anxiety of Minna’s seems at last to have\r\nculminated in a definite decision. I hit upon the idea of treating the\r\nelite of our opera company to oysters and punch in my own room on New\r\nYear’s Eve. The married couples were invited, and then came the\r\nquestion whether Fraulein Planer would consent to take part in such a\r\nfestivity. She accepted quite ingenuously, and presented herself, as\r\nneatly and becomingly dressed as ever, in my bachelor apartments, where\r\nthings soon grew pretty lively. I had already warned my landlord that\r\nwe were not likely to be very quiet, and reassured him as to any\r\npossible damage to his furniture. What the champagne failed to\r\naccomplish, the punch eventually succeeded in doing; all the restraints\r\nof petty conventionality, which the company usually endeavoured to\r\nobserve, were cast aside, giving place to an unreserved demeanour all\r\nround, to which no one objected. And then it was that Minna’s queenly\r\ndignity distinguished her from all her companions. She never lost her\r\nself-respect; and whilst no one ventured to take the slightest liberty\r\nwith her, every one very clearly recognised the simple candour with\r\nwhich she responded to my kindly and solicitous attentions. They could\r\nnot fail to see that the link existing between us was not to be\r\ncompared to any ordinary liaison, and we had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthe flighty young lady who had so openly angled for me fall into a fit\r\nover the discovery.\r\n\r\nFrom that time onward I remained permanently on the best of terms with\r\nMinna. I do not believe that she ever felt any sort of passion or\r\ngenuine love for me, or, indeed, that she was capable of such a thing,\r\nand I can therefore only describe her feeling for me as one of\r\nheartfelt goodwill, and the sincerest desire for my success and\r\nprosperity, inspired as she was with the kindest sympathy, and genuine\r\ndelight at, and admiration for, my talents. All this at last became\r\npart of her nature. She obviously had a very favourable opinion of my\r\nabilities, though she was surprised at the rapidity of my success. My\r\neccentric nature, which she knew so well how to humour pleasantly by\r\nher gentleness, stimulated her to the continual exercise of the power,\r\nso flattering to her own vanity, and without ever betraying any desire\r\nor ardour herself, she never met my impetuous advances with coldness.\r\n\r\nAt the Magdeburg theatre I had already made the acquaintance of a very\r\ninteresting woman called Mme. Haas. She was an actress, no longer in\r\nher first youth, and played so-called ‘chaperone’s parts.’ This lady\r\nwon my sympathy by telling me she had been friendly ever since her\r\nyouth with Laube, in whose destiny she continued to take a heartfelt\r\nand cordial interest. She was clever, but far from happy, and an\r\nunprepossessing exterior, which with the lapse of years grew more\r\nuninviting, did not tend to make her any happier. She lived in meagre\r\ncircumstances, with one child, and appeared to remember her better days\r\nwith a bitter grief. My first visit to her was paid merely to inquire\r\nafter Laube’s fate, but I soon became a frequent and familiar caller.\r\nAs she and Minna speedily became fast friends, we three often spent\r\npleasant evenings talking together. But when, later on, a certain\r\njealousy manifested itself on the part of the elder woman towards the\r\nyounger, our confidential relations were more or less disturbed, for it\r\nparticularly grieved me to hear Minna’s talents and mental gifts\r\ncriticised by the other. One evening I had promised Minna to have tea\r\nwith her and Mme. Haas, but I had thoughtlessly promised to go to a\r\nwhist party first. This engagement I purposely prolonged, much as it\r\nwearied me, in the deliberate hope that her companion—who had already\r\ngrown irksome to me—might have left before my arrival. The only way in\r\nwhich I could do this was by drinking hard, so that I had the very\r\nunusual experience of rising from a sober whist party in a completely\r\nfuddled condition, into which I had imperceptibly fallen, and in which\r\nI refused to believe. This incredulity deluded me into keeping my\r\nengagement for tea, although it was so late. To my intense disgust the\r\nelder woman was still there when I arrived, and her presence at once\r\nhad the effect of rousing my tipsiness to a violent outbreak; for she\r\nseemed astonished at my rowdy and unseemly behaviour, and made several\r\nremarks upon it intended for jokes, whereupon I scoffed at her in the\r\ncoarsest manner, so that she immediately left the house in high\r\ndudgeon. I had still sense enough to be conscious of Minna’s astonished\r\nlaughter at my outrageous conduct. As soon as she realised, however,\r\nthat my condition was such as to render my removal impossible without\r\ngreat commotion, she rapidly formed a resolution which must indeed have\r\ncost her an effort, though it was carried out with the utmost calmness\r\nand good-humour. She did all she could for me, and procured me the\r\nnecessary relief, and when I sank into a heavy slumber, unhesitatingly\r\nresigned her own bed to my use. There I slept until awakened by the\r\nwonderful grey of dawn. On recognising where I was, I at once realised\r\nand grew ever more convinced of the fact that this morning’s sunrise\r\nmarked the starting-point of an infinitely momentous period of my life.\r\nThe demon of care had at last entered into my existence.\r\n\r\nWithout any light-hearted jests, without gaiety or joking of any\r\ndescription, we breakfasted quietly and decorously together, and at an\r\nhour when, in view of the compromising circumstances of the previous\r\nevening, we could set out without attracting undue notice, I set off\r\nwith Minna for a long walk beyond the city gates. Then we parted, and\r\nfrom that day forward freely and openly gratified our desires as an\r\nacknowledged pair of lovers.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar direction which my musical activities had gradually taken\r\ncontinued to receive ever fresh impetus, not only from the successes,\r\nbut also from the disasters which about this time befell my efforts. I\r\nproduced the overture to my Feen with very satisfactory results at a\r\nconcert given by the Logengesellschaft, and thereby earned considerable\r\napplause. On the other hand, news came from Leipzig confirming the\r\nshabby action of the directors of the theatre in that place with regard\r\nto the promised presentation of this opera. But, happily for me, I had\r\nbegun the music for my Liebesverbot, an occupation which so absorbed my\r\nthoughts that I lost all interest in the earlier work, and abstained\r\nwith proud indifference from all further effort to secure its\r\nperformance in Leipzig. The success of its overture alone amply repaid\r\nme for the composition of my first opera.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in spite of numerous other distractions, I found time,\r\nduring the brief six months of this theatrical season in Magdeburg, to\r\ncomplete a large portion of my new opera, besides doing other work. I\r\nventured to introduce two duets from it at a concert given in the\r\ntheatre, and their reception encouraged me to proceed hopefully with\r\nthe rest of the opera.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of this season my friend Apel came to sun\r\nhimself enthusiastically in the splendour of my musical directorship.\r\nHe had written a drama, Columbus, which I recommended to our management\r\nfor production. This was a peculiarly easy favour to win, as Apel\r\nvolunteered to have a new scene, representing the Alhambra, painted at\r\nhis own expense. Besides this, he proposed to effect many welcome\r\nimprovements in the condition of the actors taking part in his play;\r\nfor, owing to the continued preference displayed by the directress for\r\nKneisel, the bass, they had all suffered very much from uncertainty\r\nabout their wages. The piece itself appeared to me to contain much that\r\nwas good. It described the difficulties and struggles of the great\r\nnavigator before he set sail on his first voyage of discovery. The\r\ndrama ended with the momentous departure of his ships from the harbour\r\nof Palos, an episode whose results are known to all the world. At my\r\ndesire Apel submitted his play to my uncle Adolph, and even in his\r\ncritical opinion it was remarkable for its lively and characteristic\r\npopular scenes. On the other hand, a love romance, which he had woven\r\ninto the plot, struck me as unnecessary and dull. In addition to a\r\nbrief chorus for some Moors who were expelled from Granada, to be sung\r\non their departure from the familiar home country, and a short\r\norchestral piece by way of conclusion, I also dashed off an overture\r\nfor my friend’s play. I sketched out the complete draft of this one\r\nevening at Minna’s house, while Apel was left free to talk to her as\r\nmuch and as loudly as he liked. The effect this composition was\r\ncalculated to produce rested on a fundamental idea which was quite\r\nsimple, yet startling in its development. Unfortunately I worked it out\r\nrather hurriedly. In not very carefully chosen phrasing the orchestra\r\nwas to represent the ocean, and, as far as might be, the ship upon it.\r\nA forcible, pathetically yearning and aspiring theme was the only\r\ncomprehensible idea amid the swirl of enveloping sound. When the whole\r\nhad been repeated, there was a sudden jump to a different theme in\r\nextreme pianissimo, accompanied by the swelling vibrations of the first\r\nviolins, which was intended to represent a Fata Morgana. I had secured\r\nthree pairs of trumpets in different keys, in order to produce this\r\nexquisite, gradually dawning and seductive theme with the utmost\r\nniceties of shade and variety of modulation. This was intended to\r\nrepresent the land of desire towards which the hero’s eyes are turned,\r\nand whose shores seem continually to rise before him only to sink\r\nelusively beneath the waves, until at last they soar in very deed above\r\nthe western horizon, the crown of all his toil and search, and stand\r\nclearly and unmistakably revealed to all the sailors, a vast continent\r\nof the future. My six trumpets were now to combine in one key, in order\r\nthat the theme assigned to them might re-echo in glorious jubilation.\r\nFamiliar as I was with the excellence of the Prussian regimental\r\ntrumpeters, I could rely upon a startling effect, especially in this\r\nconcluding passage. My overture astonished every one, and was\r\ntumultuously applauded. The play itself, however, was acted without\r\ndignity. A conceited comedian, named Ludwig Meyer, completely ruined\r\nthe title part, for which he excused himself on the ground that, having\r\nto act as stage manager also, he had been unable to commit his lines to\r\nmemory. Nevertheless, he managed to enrich his wardrobe with several\r\nsplendid costumes at Apel’s expense, wearing them, as Columbus, one\r\nafter the other. At all events, Apel had lived to see a play of his own\r\nactually performed, and although this was never repeated, yet it\r\nafforded me an opportunity of increasing my personal popularity with\r\nthe people of Magdeburg, as the overture was several times repeated at\r\nconcerts by special request.\r\n\r\nBut the chief event of this theatrical season occurred towards its\r\nclose. I induced Mme. Schroder-Devrient, who was staying in Leipzig, to\r\ncome to us for a few special performances, when, on two occasions, I\r\nhad the great satisfaction and stimulating experience of myself\r\nconducting the operas in which she sang, and thus entering into\r\nimmediate artistic collaboration with her. She appeared as Desdemona\r\nand Romeo. In the latter role particularly she surpassed herself, and\r\nkindled a fresh flame in my breast. This visit brought us also into\r\ncloser personal contact. So kindly disposed and sympathetic did she\r\nshow herself towards me, that she even volunteered to lend me her\r\nservices at a concert which I proposed to give for my own benefit,\r\nalthough this would necessitate her returning after a brief absence.\r\nUnder circumstances so auspicious I could only expect the best possible\r\nresults from my concert, and in my situation at that time its proceeds\r\nwere a matter of vital importance to me. My scanty salary from the\r\nMagdeburg opera company had become altogether illusory, being paid only\r\nin small and irregular instalments, so that I could see but one way of\r\nmeeting my daily expenses. These included frequent entertainment of a\r\nlarge circle of friends, consisting of singers and players, and the\r\nsituation had become unpleasantly accentuated by no small number of\r\ndebts. True, I did not know their exact amount; but reckoned that I\r\ncould at least form an advantageous, if indefinite, estimate of the sum\r\nto be realized by my concert, whereby the two unknown quantities might\r\nbalance each other. I therefore consoled my creditors with the tale of\r\nthese fabulous receipts, which were to pay them all in full the day\r\nafter the concert. I even went so far as to invite them to come and be\r\npaid at the hotel to which I had moved at the close of the season.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, there was nothing unreasonable in my counting on the\r\nhighest imaginable receipts, when supported by so great and popular a\r\nsinger, who, moreover, was returning to Magdeburg on purpose for the\r\nevent. I consequently acted with reckless prodigality as regards cost,\r\nlaunching out into all manner of musical extravagance, such as engaging\r\nan excellent and much larger orchestra, and arranging many rehearsals.\r\nUnfortunately for me, however, nobody would believe that such a famous\r\nactress, whose time was so precious, would really return again to\r\nplease a little Magdeburg conductor. My pompous announcement of her\r\nappearance was almost universally regarded as a deceitful manœuvre, and\r\npeople took offence at the high prices charged for seats. The result\r\nwas that the hall was only very scantily filled, a fact which\r\nparticularly grieved me on account of my generous patroness. Her\r\npromise I had never doubted. Punctually on the day appointed she\r\nreappeared to support me, and now had the painful and unaccustomed\r\nexperience of performing before a small audience. Fortunately, she\r\ntreated the matter with great good-humour (which, I learned later, was\r\nprompted by other motives, not personally concerning me). Among several\r\npieces she sang Beethoven’s Adelaïde most exquisitely, wherein, to my\r\nown astonishment, I accompanied her on the piano. But, alas! another\r\nand more unexpected mishap befell my concert, through our unfortunate\r\nselection of pieces. Owing to the excessive reverberation of the saloon\r\nin the Hotel ‘The City of London,’ the noise was unbearable. My\r\nColumbus Overture, with its six trumpets, had early in the evening\r\nfilled the audience with terror; and now, at the end, came Beethoven’s\r\nSchlacht bei Vittoria, for which, in enthusiastic expectation of\r\nlimitless receipts, I had provided every imaginable orchestral luxury.\r\nThe firing of cannon and musketry was organised with the utmost\r\nelaboration, on both the French and English sides, by means of\r\nspecially constructed and costly apparatus; while trumpets and bugles\r\nhad been doubled and trebled. Then began a battle, such as has seldom\r\nbeen more cruelly fought in a concert-room. The orchestra flung itself,\r\nso to speak, upon the scanty audience with such an overwhelming\r\nsuperiority of numbers that the latter speedily gave up all thought of\r\nresistance and literally took to flight. Mme. Schroder-Devrient had\r\nkindly taken a front seat, that she might hear the concert to an end.\r\nMuch as she may have been inured to terrors of this kind, this was more\r\nthan she could stand, even out of friendship for me. When, therefore,\r\nthe English made a fresh desperate assault upon the French position,\r\nshe took to flight, almost wringing her hands. Her action became the\r\nsignal for a panic-stricken stampede. Every one rushed out; and\r\nWellington’s victory was finally celebrated in a confidential outburst\r\nbetween myself and the orchestra alone. Thus ended this wonderful\r\nmusical festival. Schroder-Devrient at once departed, deeply regretting\r\nthe ill-success of her well-meant effort, and kindly left me to my\r\nfate. After seeking comfort in the arms of my sorrowing sweetheart, and\r\nattempting to nerve myself for the morrow’s battle, which did not seem\r\nlikely to end in a victorious symphony, I returned next morning to the\r\nhotel. I found I could only reach my rooms by running the gauntlet\r\nbetween long rows of men and women in double file, who had all been\r\nspecially invited thither for the settlement of their respective\r\naffairs. Reserving the right to select individuals from among my\r\nvisitors for separate interview, I first of all led in the second\r\ntrumpeter of the orchestra, whose duty it had been to look after the\r\ncash and the music. From his account I learned that, owing to the high\r\nfees which, in my generous enthusiasm, I had promised to the orchestra,\r\na few more shillings and sixpences would still have to come out of my\r\nown pocket to meet these charges alone. When this was settled, the\r\nposition of affairs was plain. The next person I invited to come in was\r\nMme. Gottschalk, a trustworthy Jewess, with whom I wanted to come to\r\nsome arrangement respecting the present crisis. She perceived at once\r\nthat more than ordinary help was required in this case, but did not\r\ndoubt that I should be able to obtain it from my opulent connections in\r\nLeipzig. She undertook, therefore, to appease the other creditors with\r\ntranquillising assurances, and railed, or pretended to rail, against\r\ntheir indecent conduct with great vigour. Thus at last we succeeded,\r\nthough not without some difficulty, in making the corridor outside my\r\ndoor once more passable.\r\n\r\nThe theatrical season was now over, our company on the point of\r\ndissolution, and I myself free from my appointment. But meanwhile the\r\nunhappy director of our theatre had passed from a state of chronic to\r\none of acute bankruptcy. He paid with paper money, that is to say, with\r\nwhole sheets of box-tickets for performances which he guaranteed should\r\ntake place. By dint of great craft Minna managed to extract some profit\r\neven from these singular treasury-bonds. She was living at this time\r\nmost frugally and economically. Moreover, as the dramatic company still\r\ncontinued its efforts on behalf of its members—only the opera troupe\r\nhaving been dissolved—she remained at the theatre. Thus, when I started\r\nout on my compulsory return to Leipzig, she saw me off with hearty\r\ngood-wishes for our speedy reunion, promising to spend the next\r\nholidays in visiting her parents in Dresden, on which occasion she\r\nhoped also to look me up in Leipzig.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that early in May I once more went home to my own\r\nfolk, in order that after this abortive first attempt at civic\r\nindependence, I might finally lift the load of debt with which my\r\nefforts in Magdeburg had burdened me. An intelligent brown poodle\r\nfaithfully accompanied me, and was entrusted to my family for food and\r\nentertainment as the only visible property I had acquired.\r\nNevertheless, my mother and Rosalie succeeded in founding good hopes\r\nfor my future career upon the bare fact of my being able to conduct an\r\norchestra. To me, on the other hand, the thought of returning once more\r\nto my former life with my family was very discomfiting. My relation to\r\nMinna in particular spurred me on to resume my interrupted career as\r\nspeedily as possible. The great change which had come over me in this\r\nrespect was more apparent than ever when Minna spent a few days with me\r\nin Leipzig on her way home. Her familiar and genial presence proclaimed\r\nthat my days of parental dependence were past and gone. We discussed\r\nthe renewal of my Magdeburg engagement, and I promised her an early\r\nvisit in Dresden. I obtained permission from my mother and sister to\r\ninvite her one evening to tea, and in this way I introduced her to my\r\nfamily. Rosalie saw at once how matters stood with me, but made no\r\nfurther use of the discovery than to tease me about being in love. To\r\nher the affair did not appear dangerous; but to me things wore a very\r\ndifferent aspect, for this love-lorn attachment was entirely in keeping\r\nwith my independent spirit, and my ambition to win myself a place in\r\nthe world of art.\r\n\r\nMy distaste for Leipzig itself was furthermore strengthened by a change\r\nwhich occurred there at this time in the realm of music. At the very\r\ntime that I, in Magdeburg, was attempting to make my reputation as a\r\nmusical conductor by thoughtless submission to the frivolous taste of\r\nthe day, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy was conducting the Gewandhaus concerts,\r\nand inaugurating a momentous epoch for himself and the musical taste of\r\nLeipzig. His influence had put an end to the simple ingenuousness with\r\nwhich the Leipzig public had hitherto judged the productions of its\r\nsociable subscription concerts. Through the influence of my good old\r\nfriend Pohlenz, who was not yet altogether laid on the shelf, I managed\r\nto produce my Columbus Overture at a benefit concert given by the\r\nfavourite young singer, Livia Gerhart. But, to my amazement, I found\r\nthat the taste of the musical public in Leipzig had been given a\r\ndifferent bent, which not even my rapturously applauded overture, with\r\nits brilliant combination of six trumpets, could influence. This\r\nexperience deepened my dislike of everything approaching a classical\r\ntone, in which sentiment I found myself in complete accord with honest\r\nPohlenz, who sighed good-naturedly over the downfall of the good old\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nArrangements for a musical festival at Dessau, under Friedrich\r\nSchneider’s conductorship, offered me a welcome chance of quitting\r\nLeipzig. For this journey, which could be performed on foot in seven\r\nhours, I had to procure a passport for eight days. This document was\r\ndestined to play an important part in my life for many years to come;\r\nfor on several occasions and in various European countries it was the\r\nonly paper I possessed to prove my identity. In fact, owing to my\r\nevasion of military duty in Saxony, I never again succeeded in\r\nobtaining a regular pass until I was appointed musical conductor in\r\nDresden. I derived very little artistic pleasure or benefit of any kind\r\nfrom this occasion; on the contrary, it gave a fresh impetus to my\r\nhatred of the classical. I heard Beethoven’s Symphony in C minor\r\nconducted by a man whose physiognomy, resembling that of a drunken\r\nsatyr, filled me with unconquerable disgust. In spite of an\r\ninterminable row of contrabassi, with which a conductor usually\r\ncoquettes at musical festivals, his performance was so expressionless\r\nand inane that I turned away in disgust as from an alarming and\r\nrepulsive problem, and desisted from all attempts to explain the\r\nimpassable gulf which, as I again perceived, yawned between my own\r\nvivid and imaginative conception of this work and the only living\r\npresentations of it which I had ever heard. But for the present my\r\ntormented spirits were cheered and calmed by hearing the classical\r\nSchneider’s oratorio Absalom rendered as an absolute burlesque.\r\n\r\nIt was in Dessau that Minna had made her first debut on the stage, and\r\nwhile there I heard her spoken of by frivolous young men in the tone\r\nusual in such circles when discussing young and beautiful actresses. My\r\neagerness in contradicting this chatter and confounding the\r\nscandalmongers revealed to me more clearly than ever the strength of\r\nthe passion which drew me to her.\r\n\r\nI therefore returned to Leipzig without calling on my relatives, and\r\nthere procured means for an immediate journey to Dresden. On the way\r\n(the journey was still performed by express coach) I met Minna,\r\naccompanied by one of her sisters, already on the way back to\r\nMagdeburg. Promptly procuring a posting ticket for the return journey\r\nto Leipzig, I actually set off thither with my dear girl; but by the\r\ntime we reached the next station I had succeeded in persuading her to\r\nturn back with me to Dresden. By this time the mail-coach was far ahead\r\nof us, and we had to travel by special post-chaise. This lively\r\nbustling to and fro seemed to astonish the two girls, and put them into\r\nhigh spirits. The extravagance of my conduct had evidently roused them\r\nto the expectation of adventures, and it now behoved me to fulfil this\r\nexpectation. Procuring from a Dresden acquaintance the necessary cash,\r\nI conducted my two lady friends through the Saxon Alps, where we spent\r\nseveral right merry days of innocent and youthful gaiety. Only once was\r\nthis disturbed by a passing fit of jealousy on my part, for which,\r\nindeed, there was no occasion, but which fed itself in my heart on a\r\nnervous apprehension of the future, and upon the experience I had\r\nalready gained of womenkind. Yet, despite this blot, our excursion\r\nstill lingers in my memory as the sweetest and almost sole remembrance\r\nof unalloyed happiness in the whole of my life as a young man. One\r\nevening in particular stands out in bright relief, during which we sat\r\ntogether almost all night at the watering-place of Schandau in glorious\r\nsummer weather. Indeed, my subsequent long and anxious connection with\r\nMinna, interwoven as it was with the most painful and bitter\r\nvicissitudes, has often appeared to me as a persistently prolonged\r\nexpiation of the brief and harmless enjoyment of those few days.\r\n\r\nAfter accompanying Minna to Leipzig, whence she continued her journey\r\nto Magdeburg, I presented myself to my family, but told them nothing of\r\nmy Dresden excursion. I now braced my energies, as though under the\r\nstern compulsion of a strange and deep sense of duty, to the task of\r\nmaking such arrangements as would speedily restore me to my dear one’s\r\nside. To this end a fresh engagement had to be negotiated with Director\r\nBethmann for the coming winter season. Unable to await the conclusion\r\nof our contract in Leipzig, I availed myself of Laube’s presence at the\r\nbaths in Kosen, near Naumburg, to pay him a visit. Laube had only\r\nrecently been discharged from the Berlin municipal gaol, after a\r\ntormenting inquisition of nearly a year’s duration. On giving his\r\nparole not to leave the country until the verdict had been given, he\r\nhad been permitted to retire to Kosen, from which place he, one\r\nevening, paid us a secret visit in Leipzig. I can still call his\r\nwoebegone appearance to mind. He seemed hopelessly resigned, though he\r\nspoke cheerfully with regard to all his earlier dreams of better\r\nthings; and owing to my own worries at that time about the critical\r\nstate of my affairs, this impression still remains one of my saddest\r\nand most painful recollections. While at Kosen I showed him a good many\r\nof the verses for my Liebesverbot, and although he spoke coldly of my\r\npresumption in wishing to write my own libretto, I was slightly\r\nencouraged by his appreciation of my work.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I impatiently awaited letters from Magdeburg. Not that I had\r\nany doubt as to the renewal of my engagement; on the contrary, I had\r\nevery reason to regard myself as a good acquisition for Bethmann; but I\r\nfelt as though nothing which tended to bring me nearer to Minna could\r\nmove fast enough. As soon as I received the necessary tidings, I\r\nhurried away to make all needful arrangements on the spot for ensuring\r\na magnificent success in the coming Magdeburg operatic season.\r\n\r\nThrough the tireless munificence of the King of Prussia fresh and final\r\nassistance had been granted to our perennially bankrupt theatrical\r\ndirector. His Majesty had assigned a not inconsiderable sum to a\r\ncommittee consisting of substantial Magdeburg citizens, as a subsidy to\r\nbe expended on the theatre under Bethmann’s management. What this\r\nmeant, and the respect with which I thereupon regarded the artistic\r\nconditions of Magdeburg, may be best imagined if one remembers the\r\nneglected and forlorn surroundings amid which such provincial theatres\r\nusually drag out their lives. I offered at once to undertake a long\r\njourney in search of good operatic singers. I said I would find the\r\nmeans for this at my own risk, and the only guarantee I demanded from\r\nthe management for eventual reimbursement was that they should assign\r\nme the proceeds of a future benefit performance. This offer was gladly\r\naccepted, and in pompous tones the director furnished me with the\r\nnecessary powers, and moreover gave me his parting blessing. During\r\nthis brief interval I lived once more in intimate communion with\r\nMinna—who now had her mother with her—and then took fresh leave of her\r\nfor my venturesome enterprise.\r\n\r\nBut when I got to Leipzig I found it by no means easy to procure the\r\nfunds, so confidently counted on when in Magdeburg, for the expenses of\r\nmy projected journey. The glamour of the royal protection of Prussia\r\nfor our theatrical undertaking, which I portrayed in the liveliest\r\ncolours to my good brother-in-law Brockhaus, quite failed to dazzle\r\nhim, and it was at the cost of great pains and humiliation that I\r\nfinally got my ship of discovery under weigh.\r\n\r\nI was naturally drawn first of all to my old wonderland of Bohemia.\r\nThere I merely touched at Prague and, without visiting my lovely lady\r\nfriends, I hurried forward so that I might first sample the opera\r\ncompany then playing for the season at Karlsbad. Impatient to discover\r\nas many talents as I could as soon as possible, so as not to exhaust my\r\nfunds to no purpose, I attended a performance of La Dame Blanche,\r\nsincerely hoping to find the whole performance first class. But not\r\nuntil much later did I fully realise how wretched was the quality of\r\nall these singers. I selected one of them, a bass named Graf, who was\r\nsinging Gaveston. When in due course he made his debut at Magdeburg, he\r\nprovoked so much well-founded dissatisfaction, that I could not find a\r\nword to say in reply to the mockery which this acquisition brought upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\nBut the small success with which the real object of my tour was\r\nattended was counterbalanced by the pleasantness of the journey itself.\r\nThe trip through Eger, over the Fichtel mountains, and the entry into\r\nBayreuth, gloriously illuminated by the setting sun, have remained\r\nhappy memories to this day.\r\n\r\nMy next goal was Nuremberg, where my sister Clara and her husband were\r\nacting, and from whom I might reckon on sound information as to the\r\nobject of my search. It was particularly nice to be hospitably received\r\nin my sister’s house, where I hoped to revive my somewhat exhausted\r\nmeans of travel. In this hope I reckoned chiefly upon the sale of a\r\nsnuff-box presented to me by a friend, which I had secret reasons to\r\nsuppose was made of platinum. To this I could add a gold signet-ring,\r\ngiven me by my friend Apel for composing the overture to his Columbus.\r\nThe value of the snuff-box unfortunately proved to be entirely\r\nimaginary; but by pawning these two jewels, the only ones I had left, I\r\nhoped to provide myself with the bare necessaries for continuing my\r\njourney to Frankfort. It was to this place and the Rhine district that\r\nthe information I had gathered led me to direct my steps. Before\r\nleaving I persuaded my sister and brother-in-law to accept engagements\r\nin Magdeburg; but I still lacked a first tenor and a soprano, whom\r\nhitherto I had altogether failed to discover.\r\n\r\nMy stay in Nuremberg was most agreeably prolonged through a renewed\r\nmeeting with Schroder-Devrient, who just at that time was fulfilling a\r\nshort engagement in that town. Meeting her again was like seeing the\r\nclouds disperse, which, since our last meeting, had darkened my\r\nartistic horizon.\r\n\r\nThe Nuremberg operatic company had a very limited repertoire. Besides\r\nFidelio they could produce nothing save Die Schweizerfamilie, a fact\r\nabout which this great singer complained, as this was one of her first\r\nparts sung in early youth, for which she was hardly any longer suited,\r\nand which, in addition, she had played ad nauseam. I also looked\r\nforward to the performance of Die Schweizerfamilie with misgivings, and\r\neven with anxiety, for I feared lest this tame opera and the\r\nold-fashioned sentimental part of Emmeline would weaken the great\r\nimpression the public, as well as myself, had formed up to that moment\r\nof the work of this sublime artist. Imagine, therefore, how deeply\r\nmoved and astonished I was, on the evening of the performance, to find\r\nthat it was in this very part that I first realised the truly\r\ntranscendental genius of this extraordinary woman. That anything so\r\ngreat as her interpretation of the character of the Swiss maiden could\r\nnot be handed down to posterity as a monument for all time can only be\r\nlooked upon as one of the most sublime sacrifices demanded by dramatic\r\nart, and as one of its highest manifestations. When, therefore, such\r\nphenomena appear, we cannot hold them in too great reverence, nor look\r\nupon them as too sacred.\r\n\r\nApart from all these new experiences which were to become of so much\r\nvalue to my whole life and to my artistic development, the impressions\r\nI received at Nuremberg, though they were apparently trivial in their\r\norigin, left such indelible traces on my mind, that they revived within\r\nme later on, though in quite a different and novel form.\r\n\r\nMy brother-in-law, Wolfram, was a great favourite with the Nuremberg\r\ntheatrical world; he was witty and sociable, and as such made himself\r\nmuch liked in theatrical circles. On this occasion I received\r\nsingularly delightful proofs of the spirit of extravagant gaiety\r\nmanifested on these evenings at the inn, in which I also took part. A\r\nmaster carpenter, named Lauermann, a little thick-set man, no longer\r\nyoung, of comical appearance and gifted only with the roughest dialect,\r\nwas pointed out to me in one of the inns visited by our friends as one\r\nof those oddities who involuntarily contributed most to the amusement\r\nof the local wags. Lauermann, it seems, imagined himself an excellent\r\nsinger, and as a result of this presumption, evinced interest only in\r\nthose in whom he thought he recognised a like talent. In spite of the\r\nfact that, owing to this singular peculiarity, he became the butt of\r\nconstant jest and scornful mockery, he never failed to appear every\r\nevening among his laughter-loving persecutors. So often had he been\r\nlaughed at and hurt by their scorn, that it became very difficult to\r\npersuade him to give a display of his artistic skill, and this at last\r\ncould only be effected by artfully devised traps, so laid as to appeal\r\nto his vanity. My arrival as an unknown stranger was utilised for a\r\nmanœuvre of this kind. How poor was the opinion they held of the\r\nunfortunate mastersinger’s judgment was revealed when, to my great\r\namazement, my brother-in-law introduced me to him as the great Italian\r\nsinger, Lablache. To his credit I must confess that Lauermann surveyed\r\nme for a long time with incredulous distrust, and commented with\r\ncautious suspicion on my juvenile appearance, but especially on the\r\nevidently tenor character of my voice. But the whole art of these\r\ntavern associates and their principal enjoyment consisted in leading\r\nthis poor enthusiast to believe the incredible, a task on which they\r\nspared neither time nor pains.\r\n\r\nMy brother-in-law succeeded in making the carpenter believe that I,\r\nwhile receiving fabulous sums for my performances, wished by a singular\r\nact of dissimulation, and by visiting public inns, to withdraw from the\r\ngeneral public; and that, moreover, when it came to a meeting between\r\n‘Lauermann’ and ‘Lablache,’ the only real interest could be to hear\r\nLauermann and not Lablache, seeing that the former had nothing to learn\r\nfrom the latter, but only Lablache from him. So singular was the\r\nconflict between incredulity, on the one hand, and keenly excited\r\nvanity on the other, that finally the poor carpenter became really\r\nattractive to me. I began to play the role assigned me with all the\r\nskill I could command, and after a couple of hours, which were relieved\r\nby the strangest antics, we at last gained our end. The wondrous\r\nmortal, whose flashing eyes had long been fixed on me in the greatest\r\nexcitement, worked his muscles in the peculiarly fantastic fashion\r\nwhich we are accustomed to associate with a music-making automaton, the\r\nmechanism of which has been duly wound up: his lips quivered, his teeth\r\ngnashed, his eyes rolled convulsively, until finally there broke forth,\r\nin a hoarse oily voice, an uncommonly trivial street-ballad. Its\r\ndelivery, accompanied by a regular movement of his outstretched thumbs\r\nbehind the ears, and during which his fat face glowed the brightest\r\nred, was unhappily greeted with a wild burst of laughter from all\r\npresent, which excited the unlucky master to the most furious wrath.\r\nWith studied cruelty this wrath was greeted by those, who until then\r\nhad shamelessly flattered him, with the most extravagant mockery, until\r\nthe poor wretch at last absolutely foamed with rage.\r\n\r\nAs he was leaving the inn amid a hail of curses from his infamous\r\nfriends, an impulse of genuine pity prompted me to follow him, that I\r\nmight beg his forgiveness and seek in some way to pacify him, a task\r\nall the more difficult since he was especially bitter against me as the\r\nlatest of his enemies, and the one who had so deeply deceived his eager\r\nhope of hearing the genuine Lablache. Nevertheless, I succeeded in\r\nstopping him on the threshold; and now the riotous company silently\r\nentered into an extraordinary conspiracy to induce Lauermann to sing\r\nagain that very evening. How they managed this I can as little remember\r\nas I can call to mind the effect of the spirituous liquors I imbibed.\r\nIn any case, I suspect that drink must eventually have been the means\r\nof subduing Lauermann, just as it also rendered my own recollections of\r\nthe wonderful events of that prolonged evening at the inn extremely\r\nvague. After Lauermann had for the second time suffered the same\r\nmockery, the whole company felt itself bound to accompany the unhappy\r\nman to his home. They carried him thither in a wheelbarrow, which they\r\nfound outside the house, and in this he arrived, in triumph, at his own\r\ndoor, in one of those marvellous narrow alleys peculiar to the old\r\ncity. Frau Lauermann, who was aroused from slumber to receive her\r\nhusband, enabled us, by her torrent of curses, to form some idea of the\r\nnature of their marital and domestic relations. Mockery of her\r\nhusband’s vocal talents was with her also a familiar theme; but to this\r\nshe now added the most dreadful reproaches for the worthless scamps\r\nwho, by encouraging him in this delusion, kept him from profitably\r\nfollowing his trade, and even led him to such scenes as the present\r\none. Thereupon the pride of the suffering mastersinger reasserted\r\nitself; for while his wife painfully assisted him to mount the stairs,\r\nhe harshly denied her right to sit in judgment upon his vocal gifts,\r\nand sternly ordered her to be silent. But even now this wonderful\r\nnight-adventure was by no means over. The entire swarm moved once more\r\nin the direction of the inn. Before the house, however, we found a\r\nnumber of fellows congregated, among them several workmen, against\r\nwhom, owing to police regulations as to closing hours, the doors were\r\nshut. But the regular guests of the house, who were of our party, and\r\nwho were on terms of old friendship with the host, thought that it was\r\nnevertheless permissible and possible to demand entrance. The host was\r\ntroubled at having to bar his door against friends, whose voices he\r\nrecognised; yet it was necessary to prevent the new arrivals from\r\nforcing a way in with them. Out of this situation a mighty confusion\r\narose, which, what with shouting and clamour and an inexplicable growth\r\nin the number of the disputants, soon assumed a truly demoniacal\r\ncharacter. It seemed to me as though in a few moments the whole town\r\nwould break into a tumult, and I thought I should once more have to\r\nwitness a revolution, the real origin of which no man could comprehend.\r\nThen suddenly I heard some one fall, and, as though by magic, the whole\r\nmass scattered in every direction. One of the regular guests, who was\r\nfamiliar with an ancient Nuremberg boxing trick, desiring to put an end\r\nto the interminable riot and to cut his way home through the crowd,\r\ngave one of the noisiest shouters a blow with his fist between the\r\neyes, laying him senseless on the ground, though without seriously\r\ninjuring him. And this it was that so speedily broke up the whole\r\nthrong. Within little more than a minute of the most violent uproar of\r\nhundreds of human voices, my brother-in-law and I were able to stroll\r\narm-in-arm through the moonlit streets, quietly jesting and laughing,\r\non our way home; and then it was that, to my amazement and relief, he\r\ninformed me that he was accustomed to this sort of life every evening.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, it became necessary seriously to attend to the\r\npurpose of my journey. Only in passing did I touch at Wurzburg for a\r\nday. I remember nothing of the meeting with my relations and\r\nacquaintance beyond the melancholy visit to Friederike Galvani already\r\nmentioned. On reaching Frankfort I was obliged to seek at once the\r\nshelter of a decent hotel, in order to await there the result of my\r\nsolicitations for subsidies from the directorate of the Magdeburg\r\ntheatre. My hopes of securing the real stars of our operatic\r\nundertaking were formed with a view to a season at Wiesbaden, where, I\r\nwas told, a good operatic company was on the point of dissolution. I\r\nfound it extremely difficult to arrange the short journey thither; yet\r\nI managed to be present at a rehearsal of Robert der Teufel, in which\r\nthe tenor Freimuller distinguished himself. I interviewed him at once,\r\nand found him willing to entertain my proposals for Magdeburg. We\r\nconcluded the necessary agreement, and I then returned with all speed\r\nto my headquarters, the Weidenbusch Hotel in Frankfort. There I had to\r\nspend another anxious week, during which I waited in vain for the\r\nnecessary travelling expenses to arrive from Magdeburg. To kill time I\r\nhad recourse, among other things, to a large red pocket-book which I\r\ncarried about with me in my portmanteau, and in which I entered, with\r\nexact details of dates, etc., notes for my future biography—the\r\nselfsame book which now lies before me to freshen my memory, and which\r\nI have ever since added to at various periods of my life, without\r\nleaving any gaps. Through the neglect of the Magdeburg managers my\r\nsituation, which was already serious, became literally desperate, when\r\nI made an acquisition in Frankfort which gave me almost more pleasure\r\nthan I was able to bear. I had been present at a production of the\r\nZauberflote under the direction of Guhr, then wonderfully renowned as\r\n‘a conductor of genius,’ and was agreeably surprised at the truly\r\nexcellent quality of the company. It was, of course, useless to think\r\nof luring one of the leading stars into my net; on the other hand, I\r\nsaw clearly enough that the youthful Fraulein Limbach, who sang the\r\n‘first boy’s’ part, possessed a desirable talent. She accepted my offer\r\nof an engagement, and, indeed, seemed so anxious to be rid of her\r\nFrankfort engagement that she resolved to escape from it\r\nsurreptitiously. She revealed her plans to me, and begged me to assist\r\nher in carrying them out; for, inasmuch as the directors might get wind\r\nof the affair, there was no time to lose. At all events, the young lady\r\nassumed that I had abundant credit, supplied for my official business\r\njourney by the Magdeburg theatre committee, whose praises I had so\r\ndiligently sung. But already I had been compelled to pledge my scanty\r\ntravelling gear in order to provide for my own departure. To this point\r\nI had persuaded the host, but now found him by no means inclined to\r\nadvance me the additional funds needed for carrying off a young singer.\r\nTo cloak the bad behaviour of my directors I was compelled to invent\r\nsome tale of misfortune, and to leave the astonished and indignant\r\nyoung lady behind. Heartily ashamed of this adventure, I travelled\r\nthrough rain and storm via Leipzig, where I picked up my brown poodle,\r\nand reaching Magdeburg, there resumed my work as musical director on\r\nthe 1st of September.\r\n\r\nThe result of my business labours gave me but little joy. The director,\r\nit is true, proved triumphantly that he had sent five whole golden\r\nlouis to my address in Frankfort, and that my tenor and the youthful\r\nlady-singer had also been provided with proper contracts, but not with\r\nthe fares and advances demanded. Neither of them came; only the basso\r\nGraf arrived with pedantic punctuality from Karlsbad, and immediately\r\nprovoked the chaff of our theatrical wags. He sang at a rehearsal of\r\nthe Schweizerfamilie with such a schoolmasterly drone that I completely\r\nlost my composure. The arrival of my excellent brother-in-law Wolfram\r\nwith my sister Clara was of more advantage for musical comedy than for\r\ngrand opera, and caused me considerable trouble into the bargain; for,\r\nbeing honest folk and used to decent living, they speedily perceived\r\nthat, in spite of royal protection, the condition of the theatre was\r\nbut very insecure, as was natural under so unscrupulous a management as\r\nthat of Bethmann, and recognised with alarm that they had seriously\r\ncompromised their family position. My courage had already begun to sink\r\nwhen a happy chance brought us a young woman, Mme. Pollert (nee\r\nZeibig), who was passing through Magdeburg with her husband, an actor,\r\nin order to fulfil a special engagement in that town; she was gifted\r\nwith a beautiful voice, was a talented singer, and well suited for the\r\nchief roles. Necessity had at last driven the directors to action, and\r\nat the eleventh hour they sent for the tenor Freimuller. But I was\r\nparticularly gratified when the love which had arisen between him and\r\nyoung Limbach in Frankfort enabled the enterprising tenor to carry away\r\nthis singer, to whom I had behaved so miserably. Both arrived radiant\r\nwith joy. Along with them we engaged Mme. Pollert, who, in spite of her\r\npretentiousness, met with favour from the public. A well-trained and\r\nmusically competent baritone, Herr Krug, afterwards the conductor of a\r\nchoir in Karlsruhe, had also been discovered, so that all at once I\r\nstood at the head of a really good operatic company, among which the\r\nbasso Graf could be fitted in only with great difficulty, by being kept\r\nas much as possible in the background. We succeeded quickly with a\r\nseries of operatic performances which were by no means ordinary, and\r\nour repertory included everything of this nature that had ever been\r\nwritten for the theatre. I was particularly pleased with the\r\npresentation of Spohr’s Jessonda, which was truly not without\r\nsublimity, and raised us high in the esteem of all cultured lovers of\r\nmusic. I was untiring in my endeavours to discover some means of\r\nelevating our performances above the usual level of excellence\r\ncompatible with the meagre resources of provincial theatres. I\r\npersistently fell foul of the director Bethmann by strengthening my\r\norchestra, which he had to pay; but, on the other hand, I won his\r\ncomplete goodwill by strengthening the chorus and the theatre music,\r\nwhich cost him nothing, and which lent such splendour to our\r\npresentations that subscriptions and audiences increased enormously.\r\nFor instance, I secured the regimental band, and also the military\r\nsingers, who in the Prussian army are admirably organised, and who\r\nassisted in our performances in return for free passes to the gallery\r\ngranted to their relatives. Thus I managed to furnish with the utmost\r\ncompleteness the specially strong orchestral accompaniment demanded by\r\nthe score of Bellini’s Norma, and was able to dispose of a body of male\r\nvoices for the impressive unison portion of the male chorus in the\r\nintroduction of that work such as even the greatest theatres could\r\nrarely command. In later years I was able to assure Auber, whom I often\r\nmet over an ice in Tortoni’s cafe in Paris, that in his Lestocq I had\r\nbeen able to render the part of the mutinous soldiery, when seduced\r\ninto conspiracy, with an absolutely full number of voices, a fact for\r\nwhich he thanked me with astonishment and delight.\r\n\r\nAmid such circumstances of encouragement the composition of my\r\nLiebesverbot made rapid strides towards completion. I intended the\r\npresentation of this piece for the benefit performance which had been\r\npromised me as a means of defraying my expenses, and I worked hard in\r\nthe hope of improving my reputation, and at the same time of\r\naccomplishing something by no means less desirable, and that was the\r\nbetterment of my financial position. Even the few hours which I could\r\nsnatch from business to spend at Minna’s side were devoted with\r\nunexampled zeal to the completion of my score. My diligence moved even\r\nMinna’s mother, who looked with some uneasiness upon our love affair.\r\nShe had remained over the summer on a visit to her daughter, and\r\nmanaged the house for her. Owing to her interference a new and urgent\r\nanxiety had entered into our relations, which pressed for serious\r\nsettlement. It was natural that we should begin to think of what it was\r\nall going to lead to. I must confess that the idea of marriage,\r\nespecially in view of my youth, filled me with dismay, and without\r\nindeed reflecting on the matter, or seriously weighing its pros and\r\ncons, a naive and instinctive feeling prevented me even from\r\nconsidering the possibility of a step which would have such serious\r\nconsequences upon my whole life. Moreover, our modest circumstances\r\nwere in so alarming and uncertain a state that even Minna declared that\r\nshe was more anxious to see these improved than to get me to marry her.\r\nBut she was also driven to think of herself, and that promptly, for\r\ntrouble arose with regard to her own position in the Magdeburg theatre.\r\nThere she had met with a rival in her own speciality, and as this\r\nwoman’s husband became chief stage manager, and consequently had\r\nsupreme power, she grew to be a source of great danger. Seeing,\r\ntherefore, that at this very moment Minna received advantageous offers\r\nfrom the managers of the Konigstadt theatre in Berlin, then doing a\r\nsplendid business, she seized the opportunity to break off her\r\nconnection with the Magdeburg theatre, and thus plunged me, whom she\r\ndid not appear to consider in the matter, into the depths of despair. I\r\ncould not hinder Minna from going to Berlin to fulfil a special\r\nengagement there, although this was not in accordance with her\r\nagreement, and so she departed, leaving me behind, overcome with grief\r\nand doubt as to the meaning of her conduct. At last, mad with passion,\r\nI wrote to her urging her to return, and the better to move her and not\r\nto separate her fate from my own, I proposed to her in a strictly\r\nformal manner, and hinted at the hope of early marriage. About the same\r\ntime my brother-in-law, Wolfram, having quarrelled with the director\r\nBethmann and cancelled his contract with him, also went to the\r\nKonigstadt theatre to fulfil a special engagement. My good sister\r\nClara, who had remained behind for a while amid the somewhat unpleasant\r\nconditions of Magdeburg, soon perceived the anxious and troubled temper\r\nin which her otherwise cheerful brother was rapidly consuming himself.\r\nOne day she thought it advisable to show me a letter from her husband,\r\nwith news from Berlin, and especially concerning Minna, in which he\r\nearnestly deplored my passion for this girl, who was acting quite\r\nunworthily of me. As she lodged at his hotel, he was able to observe\r\nthat not only the company she kept, but also her own conduct, were\r\nperfectly scandalous. The extraordinary impression which this dreadful\r\ncommunication made upon me decided me to abandon the reserve I had\r\nhitherto shown towards my relatives with regard to my love affairs. I\r\nwrote to my brother-in-law in Berlin, telling him how matters stood\r\nwith me, and that my plans greatly depended on Minna, and further, how\r\nextremely important it was for me to learn from him the indubitable\r\ntruth concerning her of whom he had sent so evil an account. From my\r\nbrother-in-law, usually so dry and given to joking, I received a reply\r\nwhich filled my heart to overflowing again. He confessed that he had\r\naccused Minna too hastily, and regretted that he had allowed idle\r\nchatter to influence him in founding a charge, which, on investigation,\r\nhad proved to be altogether groundless and unjust; he declared,\r\nmoreover, that on nearer acquaintance and conversation with her he had\r\nbeen so fully convinced of the genuineness and uprightness of her\r\ncharacter, that he hoped with all his heart that I might see my way to\r\nmarry her. And now a storm raged in my heart. I implored Minna to\r\nreturn at once, and was glad to learn that, for her part, she was not\r\ninclined to renew her engagement at the Berlin theatre, as she had now\r\nacquired a more intimate knowledge of the life there, and found it too\r\nfrivolous. All that remained, then, was for me to facilitate the\r\nresumption of her Magdeburg engagement. To this end, therefore, at a\r\nmeeting of the theatre committee, I attacked the director and his\r\ndetested stage manager with such energy, and defended Minna against the\r\nwrong done her by them both with such passion and fervour, that the\r\nother members, astonished at the frank confession of my affection,\r\nyielded to my wishes without any further ado. And now I set off by\r\nextra post in the depth of night and in dreadful winter weather to meet\r\nmy returning sweetheart. I greeted her with tears of deepest joy, and\r\nled her back in triumph to her cosy Magdeburg home, already become so\r\ndear to me.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as our two lives, thus severed for a while, were being drawn\r\nmore and more closely together, I finished the score of my Liebesverbot\r\nabout New Year 1836. For the development of my future plans I depended\r\nnot a little upon the success of this work; and Minna herself seemed\r\nnot disinclined to yield to my hopes in this respect. We had reason to\r\nbe concerned as to how matters would pan out for us at the beginning of\r\nthe spring, for this season is always a bad one in which to start such\r\nprecarious theatrical enterprises. In spite of royal support and the\r\nparticipation of the theatre committee in the general management of the\r\ntheatre, our worthy director’s state of perennial bankruptcy suffered\r\nno alteration, and it seemed as if his theatrical undertaking could not\r\npossibly last much longer in any form. Nevertheless, with the help of\r\nthe really first-rate company of singers at my disposal, the production\r\nof my opera was to mark a complete change in my unsatisfactory\r\ncircumstances. With the view of recovering the travelling expenses I\r\nhad incurred during the previous summer, I was entitled to a benefit\r\nperformance. I naturally fixed this for the presentation of my own\r\nwork, and did my utmost so that this favour granted me by the directors\r\nshould prove as inexpensive to them as possible. As they would\r\nnevertheless be compelled to incur some expense in the production of\r\nthe new opera, I agreed that the proceeds of the first presentation\r\nshould be left to them, while I should claim only those of the second.\r\nI did not consider it altogether unsatisfactory that the time for the\r\nrehearsals was postponed until the very end of the season, for it was\r\nreasonable to suppose that our company, which was often greeted with\r\nunusual applause, would receive special attention and favour from the\r\npublic during its concluding performances. Unfortunately, however,\r\ncontrary to our expectations, we never reached the proper close of this\r\nseason, which had been fixed for the end of April; for already in\r\nMarch, owing to irregularity in the payment of salaries, the most\r\npopular members of the company, having found better employment\r\nelsewhere, tendered their resignations to the management, and the\r\ndirector, who was unable to raise the necessary cash, was compelled to\r\nbow to the inevitable. Now, indeed, my spirits sank, for it seemed more\r\nthan doubtful whether my Liebesverbot would ever be produced at all. I\r\nowed it entirely to the warm affection felt for me personally by all\r\nmembers of the opera company, that the singers consented not only to\r\nremain until the end of March, but also to undertake the toil of\r\nstudying and rehearsing my opera, a task which, considering the very\r\nlimited time, promised to be extremely arduous. In the event of our\r\nhaving to give two representations, the time at our disposal was so\r\nvery short that, for all the rehearsals, we had but ten days before us.\r\nAnd since we were concerned not with a light comedy or farce, but with\r\na grand opera, and one which, in spite of the trifling character of its\r\nmusic, contained numerous and powerful concerted passages, the\r\nundertaking might have been regarded almost as foolhardy. Nevertheless,\r\nI built my hopes upon the extraordinary exertions which the singers so\r\nwillingly made in order to please me; for they studied continuously,\r\nmorning, noon, and night. But seeing that, in spite of all this, it was\r\nquite impossible to attain to perfection, especially in the matter of\r\nwords, in the case of every one of these harassed performers, I\r\nreckoned further on my own acquired skill as conductor to achieve the\r\nfinal miracle of success. The peculiar ability I possessed of helping\r\nthe singers and of making them, in spite of much uncertainty, seem to\r\nflow smoothly onwards, was clearly demonstrated in our orchestral\r\nrehearsals, in which, by dint of constant prompting, loud singing with\r\nthe performers and vigorous directions as to necessary action, I got\r\nthe whole thing to run so easily that it seemed quite possible that the\r\nperformance might be a reasonable success after all. Unfortunately, we\r\ndid not consider that in front of the public all these drastic methods\r\nof moving the dramatic and musical machinery would be restricted to the\r\nmovements of my baton and to my facial expression. As a matter of fact\r\nthe singers, and especially the men, were so extraordinarily uncertain\r\nthat from beginning to end their embarrassment crippled the\r\neffectiveness of every one of their parts. Freimuller, the tenor, whose\r\nmemory was most defective, sought to patch up the lively and emotional\r\ncharacter of his badly learned rule of the madcap Luzio by means of\r\nroutine work learned in Fra Diavolo and Zampa, and especially by the\r\naid of an enormously thick, brightly coloured and fluttering plume of\r\nfeathers. Consequently, as the directors failed to have the book of\r\nwords printed in time, it was impossible to blame the public for being\r\nin doubt as to the main outlines of the story, seeing that they had\r\nonly the sung words to guide them. With the exception of a few portions\r\nplayed by the lady singers, which were favourably received, the whole\r\nperformance, which I had made to depend largely upon bold, energetic\r\naction and speech, remained but a musical shadow-play, to which the\r\norchestra contributed its own inexplicable effusions, sometimes with\r\nexaggerated noise. As characteristic of the treatment of my\r\ntone-colour, I may mention that the band-master of a Prussian military\r\nband, who, by the bye, had been well pleased with the performance, felt\r\nit incumbent upon him to give me some well-meant hints for my future\r\nguidance, as to the manipulation of the Turkish drum. Before I relate\r\nthe further history of this wonderful work of my youth, I will pause a\r\nmoment briefly to describe its character, and especially its poetical\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nShakespeare’s play, which I kept throughout in mind as the foundation\r\nof my story, was worked out in the following manner:—\r\n\r\nAn unnamed king of Sicily leaves his country, as I suggest, for a\r\njourney to Naples, and hands over to the Regent appointed—whom I simply\r\ncall Friedrich, with the view of making him appear as German as\r\npossible—full authority to exercise all the royal power in order to\r\neffect a complete reform in the social habits of his capital, which had\r\nprovoked the indignation of the Council. At the opening of the play we\r\nsee the servants of the public authority busily employed either in\r\nshutting up or in pulling down the houses of popular amusement in a\r\nsuburb of Palermo, and in carrying off the inmates, including hosts and\r\nservants, as prisoners. The populace oppose this first step, and much\r\nscuffling ensues. In the thickest of the throng the chief of the\r\nsbirri, Brighella (basso-buffo), after a preliminary roll of drums for\r\nsilence, reads out the Regent’s proclamation, according to which the\r\nacts just performed are declared to be directed towards establishing a\r\nhigher moral tone in the manners and customs of the people. A general\r\noutburst of scorn and a mocking chorus meets this announcement. Luzio,\r\na young nobleman and juvenile scape-grace (tenor), seems inclined to\r\nthrust himself forward as leader of the mob, and at once finds an\r\noccasion for playing a more active part in the cause of the oppressed\r\npeople on discovering his friend Claudio (also a tenor) being led away\r\nto prison. From him he learns that, in pursuance of some musty old law\r\nunearthed by Friedrich, he is to suffer the penalty of death for a\r\ncertain love escapade in which he is involved. His sweetheart, union\r\nwith whom had been prevented by the enmity of their parents, has borne\r\nhim a child. Friedrich’s puritanical zeal joins cause with the parents’\r\nhatred; he fears the worst, and sees no way of escape save through\r\nmercy, provided his sister Isabella may be able, by her entreaties, to\r\nmelt the Regent’s hard heart. Claudio implores his friend at once to\r\nseek out Isabella in the convent of the Sisters of St. Elizabeth, which\r\nshe has recently entered as novice. There, between the quiet walls of\r\nthe convent, we first meet this sister, in confidential intercourse\r\nwith her friend Marianne, also a novice. Marianne reveals to her\r\nfriend, from whom she has long been parted, the unhappy fate which has\r\nbrought her to the place. Under vows of eternal fidelity she had been\r\npersuaded to a secret liaison with a man of high rank. But finally,\r\nwhen in extreme need she found herself not only forsaken, but\r\nthreatened by her betrayer, she discovered him to be the mightiest man\r\nin the state, none other than the King’s Regent himself. Isabella’s\r\nindignation finds vent in impassioned words, and is only pacified by\r\nher determination to forsake a world in which so vile a crime can go\r\nunpunished.—When now Luzio brings her tidings of her own brother’s\r\nfate, her disgust at her brother’s misconduct is turned at once to\r\nscorn for the villainy of the hypocritical Regent, who presumes so\r\ncruelly to punish the comparatively venial offence of her brother,\r\nwhich, at least, was not stained by treachery. Her violent outburst\r\nimprudently reveals her to Luzio in a seductive aspect; smitten with\r\nsudden love, he urges her to quit the convent for ever and to accept\r\nhis hand. She contrives to check his boldness, but resolves at once to\r\navail herself of his escort to the Regent’s court of justice.—Here the\r\ntrial scene is prepared, and I introduce it by a burlesque hearing of\r\nseveral persons charged by the sbirro captain with offences against\r\nmorality. The earnestness of the situation becomes more marked when the\r\ngloomy form of Friedrich strides through the inrushing and unruly\r\ncrowd, commanding silence, and he himself undertakes the hearing of\r\nClaudio’s case in the sternest manner possible. The implacable judge is\r\nalready on the point of pronouncing sentence when Isabella enters, and\r\nrequests, before them all, a private interview with the Regent. In this\r\ninterview she behaves with noble moderation towards the dreaded, yet\r\ndespised man before her, and appeals at first only to his mildness and\r\nmercy. His interruptions merely serve to stimulate her ardour: she\r\nspeaks of her brother’s offence in melting accents, and implores\r\nforgiveness for so human and by no means unpardonable a crime. Seeing\r\nthe effect of her moving appeal, she continues with increasing ardour\r\nto plead with the judge’s hard and unresponsive heart, which can\r\ncertainly not have remained untouched by sentiments such as those which\r\nhad actuated her brother, and she calls upon his memory of these to\r\nsupport her desperate plea for pity. At last the ice of his heart is\r\nbroken. Friedrich, deeply stirred by Isabella’s beauty, can no longer\r\ncontain himself, and promises to grant her petition at the price of her\r\nown love. Scarcely has she become aware of the unexpected effect of her\r\nwords when, filled with indignation at such incredible villainy, she\r\ncries to the people through doors and windows to come in, that she may\r\nunmask the hypocrite before the world. The crowd is already rushing\r\ntumultuously into the hall of judgment, when, by a few significant\r\nhints, Friedrich, with frantic energy, succeeds in making Isabella\r\nrealise the impossibility of her plan. He would simply deny her charge,\r\nboldly pretend that his offer was merely made to test her, and would\r\ndoubtless be readily believed so soon as it became only a question of\r\nrebutting a charge of lightly making love to her. Isabella, ashamed and\r\nconfounded, recognises the madness of her first step, and gnashes her\r\nteeth in silent despair. While then Friedrich once more announces his\r\nstern resolve to the people, and pronounces sentence on the prisoner,\r\nit suddenly occurs to Isabella, spurred by the painful recollection of\r\nMarianne’s fate, that what she has failed to procure by open means she\r\nmight possibly obtain by craft. This thought suffices to dispel her\r\nsorrow, and to fill her with utmost gaiety. Turning to her sorrowing\r\nbrother, her agitated friends, and the perplexed crowd, she assures\r\nthem all that she is ready to provide them with the most amusing of\r\nadventures. She declares that the carnival festivities, which the\r\nRegent has just strictly forbidden, are to be celebrated this year with\r\nunusual licence; for this dreaded ruler only pretends to be so cruel,\r\nin order the more pleasantly to astonish them by himself taking a merry\r\npart in all that he has just forbidden. They all believe that she has\r\ngone mad, and Friedrich in particular reproves her incomprehensible\r\nfolly with passionate severity. But a few words on her part suffice to\r\ntransport the Regent himself with ecstasy; for in a whisper she\r\npromises to grant his desire, and that on the following night she will\r\nsend him such a message as shall ensure his happiness.—And so ends the\r\nfirst act in a whirl of excitement.\r\n\r\nWe learn the nature of the heroine’s hastily formed plan at the\r\nbeginning of the second act, in which she visits her brother in his\r\ncell, with the object of discovering whether he is worthy of rescue.\r\nShe reveals Friedrich’s shameful proposal to him, and asks if he would\r\nwish to save his life at the price of his sister’s dishonour. Then\r\nfollow Claudio’s fury and fervent declaration of his readiness to die;\r\nwhereupon, bidding farewell to his sister, at least for this life, he\r\nmakes her the bearer of the most tender messages to the dear girl whom\r\nhe leaves behind. After this, sinking into a softer mood, the unhappy\r\nman declines from a state of melancholy to one of weakness. Isabella,\r\nwho had already determined to inform him of his rescue, hesitates in\r\ndismay when she sees him fall in this way from the heights of noble\r\nenthusiasm to a muttered confession of a love of life still as strong\r\nas ever, and even to a stammering query as to whether the suggested\r\nprice of his salvation is altogether impossible. Disgusted, she springs\r\nto her feet, thrusts the unworthy man from her, and declares that to\r\nthe shame of his death he has further added her most hearty contempt.\r\nAfter having handed him over again to his gaoler, her mood once more\r\nchanges swiftly to one of wanton gaiety. True, she resolves to punish\r\nthe waverer by leaving him for a time in uncertainty as to his fate;\r\nbut stands firm by her resolve to rid the world of the abominable\r\nseducer who dared to dictate laws to his fellow-men. She tells Marianne\r\nthat she must take her place at the nocturnal rendezvous, at which\r\nFriedrich so treacherously expected to meet her (Isabella), and sends\r\nFriedrich an invitation to this meeting. In order to entangle the\r\nlatter even more deeply in ruin, she stipulates that he must come\r\ndisguised and masked, and fixes the rendezvous in one of those pleasure\r\nresorts which he has just suppressed. To the madcap Luzio, whom she\r\nalso desires to punish for his saucy suggestion to a novice, she\r\nrelates the story of Friedrich’s proposal, and her pretended intention\r\nof complying, from sheer necessity, with his desires. This she does in\r\na fashion so incomprehensively light-hearted that the otherwise\r\nfrivolous man, first dumb with amazement, ultimately yields to a fit of\r\ndesperate rage. He swears that, even if the noble maiden herself can\r\nendure such shame, he will himself strive by every means in his power\r\nto avert it, and would prefer to set all Palermo on fire and in tumult\r\nrather than allow such a thing to happen. And, indeed, he arranges\r\nthings in such a manner that on the appointed evening all his friends\r\nand acquaintances assemble at the end of the Corso, as though for the\r\nopening of the prohibited carnival procession. At nightfall, as things\r\nare beginning to grow wild and merry, Luzio appears, and sings an\r\nextravagant carnival song, with the refrain:\r\n\r\nWho joins us not in frolic jest\r\nShall have a dagger in his breast;\r\n\r\n\r\nby which means he seeks to stir the crowd to bloody revolt. When a band\r\nof sbirri approaches, under Brighella’s leadership, to scatter the gay\r\nthrong, the mutinous project seems on the point of being accomplished.\r\nBut for the present Luzio prefers to yield, and to scatter about the\r\nneighbourhood, as he must first of all win the real leader of their\r\nenterprise: for here was the spot which Isabella had mischievously\r\nrevealed to him as the place of her pretended meeting with the Regent.\r\nFor the latter Luzio therefore lies in wait. Recognising him in an\r\nelaborate disguise, he blocks his way, and as Friedrich violently\r\nbreaks loose, is on the point of following him with shouts and drawn\r\nsword, when, on a sign from Isabella, who is hidden among some bushes,\r\nhe is himself stopped and led away. Isabella then advances, rejoicing\r\nin the thought of having restored the betrayed Marianne to her\r\nfaithless spouse. Believing that she holds in her hand the promised\r\npardon for her brother, she is just on the point of abandoning all\r\nthought of further vengeance when, breaking the seal, to her intense\r\nhorror she recognises by the light of a torch that the paper contains\r\nbut a still more severe order of execution, which, owing to her desire\r\nnot to disclose to her brother the fact of his pardon, a mere chance\r\nhad now delivered into her hand, through the agency of the bribed\r\ngaoler. After a hard fight with the tempestuous passion of love, and\r\nrecognising his helplessness against this enemy of his peace, Friedrich\r\nhas in fact already resolved to face his ruin, even though as a\r\ncriminal, yet still as a man of honour. An hour on Isabella’s breast,\r\nand then—his own death by the same law whose implacable severity shall\r\nalso claim Claudio’s life. Isabella, perceiving in this conduct only a\r\nfurther proof of the hypocrite’s villainy, breaks out once more into a\r\ntempest of agonised despair. Upon her cry for immediate revolt against\r\nthe scoundrelly tyrant, the people collect together and form a motley\r\nand passionate crowd. Luzio, who also returns, counsels the people with\r\nstinging bitterness to pay no heed to the woman’s fury; he points out\r\nthat she is only tricking them, as she has already tricked him—for he\r\nstill believes in her shameless infidelity. Fresh confusion; increased\r\ndespair of Isabella; suddenly from the background comes the burlesque\r\ncry of Brighella for help, who, himself suffering from the pangs of\r\njealousy, has by mistake arrested the masked Regent, and thus led to\r\nthe latter’s discovery. Friedrich is recognised, and Marianne,\r\ntrembling on his breast, is also unmasked. Amazement, indignation!\r\nCries of joy burst forth all round; the needful explanations are\r\nquickly given, and Friedrich sullenly demands to be set before the\r\njudgment-seat of the returning King. Claudio, released from prison by\r\nthe jubilant populace, informs him that the sentence of death for\r\ncrimes of love is not intended for all times; messengers arrive to\r\nannounce the unexpected arrival in harbour of the King; it is resolved\r\nto march in full masked procession to meet the beloved Prince, and\r\njoyously to pay him homage, all being convinced that he will heartily\r\nrejoice to see how ill the gloomy puritanism of Germany is suited to\r\nhis hot-blooded Sicily. Of him it is said:\r\n\r\nYour merry festals please him more\r\nThan gloomy laws or legal lore.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriedrich, with his freshly affianced wife, Marianne, must lead the\r\nprocession, followed by Luzio and the novice, who is for ever lost to\r\nthe convent.\r\n\r\nThese spirited and, in many respects, boldly devised scenes I had\r\nclothed in suitable language and carefully written verse, which had\r\nalready been noticed by Laube. The police at first took exception to\r\nthe title of the work, which, had I not changed it, would have led to\r\nthe complete failure of my plans for its presentation. It was the week\r\nbefore Easter, and the theatre was consequently forbidden to produce\r\njolly, or at least frivolous, plays during this period. Luckily the\r\nmagistrate, with whom I had to treat concerning the matter, did not\r\nshow any inclination to examine the libretto himself; and when I\r\nassured him that it was modelled upon a very serious play of\r\nShakespeare’s, the authorities contented themselves merely with\r\nchanging the somewhat startling title. Die Novize van Palermo, which\r\nwas the new title, had nothing suspicious about it, and was therefore\r\napproved as correct without further scruple. I fared quite otherwise in\r\nLeipzig, where I attempted to introduce this work in the place of my\r\nFeen, when the latter was withdrawn. The director, Ringelhardt, whom I\r\nsought to win over to my cause by assigning the part of Marianne to his\r\ndaughter, then making her debut in opera, chose to reject my work on\r\nthe apparently very reasonable grounds that the tendency of the theme\r\ndispleased him. He assured me that, even if the Leipzig magistrates had\r\nconsented to its production—a fact concerning which his high esteem for\r\nthat body led him to have serious doubts—he himself, as a conscientious\r\nfather, could certainly not permit his daughter to take part in it.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, I suffered nothing from the suspicious nature of the\r\nlibretto of my opera on the occasion of its production in Magdeburg;\r\nfor, as I have said, thanks to the unintelligible manner in which it\r\nwas produced, the story remained a complete mystery to the public. This\r\ncircumstance, and the fact that no opposition had been raised on the\r\nground of its TENDENCY, made a second performance possible, and as\r\nnobody seemed to care one way or the other, no objections were raised.\r\nFeeling sure that my opera had made no impression, and had left the\r\npublic completely undecided about its merits, I reckoned that, in view\r\nof this being the farewell performance of our opera company, we should\r\nhave good, not to say large, takings. Consequently I did not hesitate\r\nto charge ‘full’ prices for admittance. I cannot rightly judge whether,\r\nup to the commencement of the overture, any people had taken their\r\nplaces in the auditorium; but about a quarter of an hour before the\r\ntime fixed for beginning, I saw only Mme. Gottschalk and her husband,\r\nand, curiously enough, a Polish Jew in full dress, seated in the\r\nstalls. Despite this, I was still hoping for an increase in the\r\naudience, when suddenly the most incredible commotion occurred behind\r\nthe scenes. Herr Pollert, the husband of my prima donna (who was acting\r\nIsabella), was assaulting Schreiber, the second tenor, a very young and\r\nhandsome man taking the part of Claudio, and against whom the injured\r\nhusband had for some time been nursing a secret rancour born of\r\njealousy. It appeared that the singer’s husband, who had surveyed the\r\ntheatre from behind the drop-scene with me, had satisfied himself as to\r\nthe style of the audience, and decided that the longed-for hour was at\r\nhand when, without injuring the operatic enterprise, he could wreak\r\nvengeance on his wife’s lover. Claudio was so severely used by him that\r\nthe unfortunate fellow had to seek refuge in the dressing-room, his\r\nface covered with blood. Isabella was told of this, and rushed\r\ndespairingly to her raging spouse, only to be so soundly cuffed by him\r\nthat she went into convulsions. The confusion that ensued amongst the\r\ncompany soon knew no bounds: they took sides in the quarrel, and little\r\nwas wanting for it to turn into a general fight, as everybody seemed to\r\nregard this unhappy evening as particularly favourable for the paying\r\noff of any old scores and supposed insults. This much was clear, that\r\nthe couple suffering from the effects of Herr Pollert’s conjugal\r\nresentment were unfit to appear that evening. The manager was sent\r\nbefore the drop-scene to inform the small and strangely assorted\r\naudience gathered in the theatre that, owing to unforeseen\r\ncircumstances, the representation would not take place.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of my career as director and composer in Magdeburg,\r\nwhich in the beginning had seemed so full of promise and had been\r\nstarted at the cost of considerable sacrifice. The serenity of art now\r\ngave way completely before the stern realities of life. My position\r\ngave food for meditation, and the outlook was not a cheerful one. All\r\nthe hopes that I and Minna had founded upon the success of my work had\r\nbeen utterly destroyed. My creditors, who had been appeased by the\r\nanticipation of the expected harvest, lost faith in my talents, and now\r\ncounted solely on obtaining bodily possession of me, which they\r\nendeavoured to do by speedily instituting legal proceedings. Now that\r\nevery time I came home I found a summons nailed to my door, my little\r\ndwelling in the Breiter Weg became unbearable; I avoided going there,\r\nespecially since my brown poodle, who had hitherto enlivened this\r\nretreat, had vanished, leaving no trace. This I looked upon as a bad\r\nsign, indicating my complete downfall.\r\n\r\nAt this time Minna, with her truly comforting assurance and firmness of\r\nbearing, was a tower of strength to me and the one thing I had left to\r\nfall back upon. Always full of resource, she had first of all provided\r\nfor her own future, and was on the point of signing a not unfavourable\r\ncontract with the directors of the theatre at Königsberg in Prussia. It\r\nwas now a question of finding me an appointment in the same place as\r\nmusical conductor; this post was already filled. The Königsberg\r\ndirector, however, gathering from our correspondence that Minna’s\r\nacceptance of the engagement depended upon the possibility of my being\r\ntaken on at the same theatre, held out the prospect of an approaching\r\nvacancy, and expressed his willingness to allow it to be filled by me.\r\nOn the strength of this assurance it was decided that Minna should go\r\non to Königsberg and pave the way for my arrival there.\r\n\r\nEre these plans could be carried out, we had still to spend a time of\r\ndreadful and acute anxiety, which I shall never forget, within the\r\nwalls of Magdeburg. It is true I made one more personal attempt in\r\nLeipzig to improve my position, on which occasion I entered into the\r\ntransactions mentioned above with the director of the theatre regarding\r\nmy new opera. But I soon realised that it was out of the question for\r\nme to remain in my native town, and in the disquieting proximity of my\r\nfamily, from which I was restlessly anxious to get away. My\r\nexcitability and depression were noticed by my relations. My mother\r\nentreated me, whatever else I might decide to do, on no account to be\r\ndrawn into marriage while still so young. To this I made no reply. When\r\nI took my leave, Rosalie accompanied me to the head of the stairs. I\r\nspoke of returning as soon as I had attended to certain important\r\nbusiness matters, and wanted to wish her a hurried good-bye: she\r\ngrasped my hand, and gazing into my face, exclaimed, “God alone knows\r\nwhen I shall see you again!” This cut me to the heart, and I felt\r\nconscience-stricken. The fact that she was expressing the presentiment\r\nshe felt of her early death I only realised when, barely two years\r\nlater, without having seen her again, I received the news that she had\r\ndied very suddenly.\r\n\r\nI spent a few more weeks with Minna in the strictest retirement in\r\nMagdeburg: she endeavoured to the best of her ability to relieve the\r\nembarrassment of my position. In view of our approaching separation,\r\nand the length of time we might be parted, I hardly left her side, our\r\nonly relaxation being the walks we took together round the outskirts of\r\nthe town. Anxious forebodings weighed upon us; the May sun which lit\r\nthe sad streets of Magdeburg, as if in mockery of our forlorn\r\ncondition, was one day more clouded over than I have ever seen it\r\nsince, and filled me with a positive dread. On our way home from one of\r\nthese walks, as we were approaching the bridge crossing the Elbe, we\r\ncaught sight of a man flinging himself from it into the water beneath.\r\nWe ran to the bank, called for help, and persuaded a miller, whose mill\r\nwas situated on the river, to hold out a rake to the drowning man, who\r\nwas being swept in his direction by the current. With indescribable\r\nanxiety we waited for the decisive moment—saw the sinking man stretch\r\nout his hands towards the rake, but he failed to grasp it, and at the\r\nsame moment disappeared under the mill, never to be seen again. On the\r\nmorning that I accompanied Minna to the stage-coach to bid her a most\r\nsorrowful farewell, the whole population was pouring from one of the\r\ngateways of the town towards a big field, to witness the execution of a\r\nman condemned to be put to death on the wheel ‘from below.’[7] The\r\nculprit was a soldier who had murdered his sweetheart in a fit of\r\njealousy. When, later in the day, I sat down to my last dinner at the\r\ninn, I heard the dreadful details of the Prussian mode of execution\r\nbeing discussed on all sides. A young magistrate, who was a great lover\r\nof music, told us about a conversation he had had with the executioner,\r\nwho had been procured from Halle, and with whom he had discussed the\r\nmost humane method of hastening the death of the victim; in telling us\r\nabout him, he recalled the elegant dress and manners of this ill-omened\r\nperson with a shudder.\r\n\r\n [7] _Durch das Rod van unten_. The punishment of the wheel was usually\r\n inflicted upon murderers, incendiaries, highwaymen and church robbers.\r\n There were two methods of inflicting this: (1) ‘from above downwards’\r\n (_von oben nach unten_), in which the condemned man was despatched\r\n instantly owing to his neck getting broken from the start; and (2)\r\n ‘from below upwards’ (_von unten nach oben_), which is the method\r\n referred to above, and in which all the limbs of the victim were\r\n broken previous to his body being actually twisted through the spokes\r\n of the wheel.—Editor\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were the last impressions I carried away from the scene of my\r\nfirst artistic efforts and of my attempts at earning an independent\r\nlivelihood. Often since then on my departure from places where I had\r\nexpected to find prosperity, and to which I knew I should never return,\r\nthose impressions have recurred to my mind with singular persistence. I\r\nhave always had much the same feelings upon leaving any place where I\r\nhad stayed in the hope of improving my position.\r\n\r\nThus I arrived in Berlin for the first time on the 18th May, 1836, and\r\nmade acquaintance with the peculiar features of that pretentious royal\r\ncapital. While my position was an uncertain one, I sought a modest\r\nshelter at the Crown Prince in the Königstrasse, where Minna had stayed\r\na few months before. I found a friend on whom I could rely when I came\r\nacross Laube again, who, while awaiting his verdict, was busying\r\nhimself with private and literary work in Berlin. He was much\r\ninterested in the fate of my work Liebesverbot, and advised me to turn\r\nmy present situation to account for the purpose of obtaining the\r\nproduction of this opera at the Konigstadt theatre. This theatre was\r\nunder the direction of one of the most curious creatures in Berlin: he\r\nwas called ‘Cerf,’ and the title of Commissionsrath had been conferred\r\nupon him by the King of Prussia. To account for the favours bestowed\r\nupon him by royalty, many reasons of a not very edifying nature were\r\ncirculated. Through this royal patronage he had succeeded in extending\r\nconsiderably the privileges already enjoyed by the suburban theatre.\r\nThe decline of grand opera at the Theatre Royal had brought light\r\nopera, which was performed with great success at the Konigstadt\r\ntheatre, into public favour. The director, puffed up by success, openly\r\nlaboured under the delusion that he was the right man in the right\r\nplace, and expressed his entire agreement with those who declared that\r\none could only expect a theatre to be successfully managed by common\r\nand uneducated men, and continued to cling to his blissful and\r\nboundless state of ignorance in the most amusing manner. Relying\r\nabsolutely upon his own insight, he had assumed an entirely dictatorial\r\nattitude towards the officially appointed artists of his theatre, and\r\nallowed himself to deal with them according to his likes and dislikes.\r\nI seemed destined to be favoured by this mode of procedure: at my very\r\nfirst visit Cerf expressed his satisfaction with me, but wished to make\r\nuse of me as a ‘tenor.’ He offered no objection whatever to my request\r\nfor the production of my opera, but, on the contrary, promised to have\r\nit staged immediately. He seemed particularly anxious to appoint me\r\nconductor of the orchestra. As he was on the point of changing his\r\noperatic company, he foresaw that his present conductor, Glaser, the\r\ncomposer of Adlershorst, would hinder his plans by taking the part of\r\nthe older singers: he was therefore anxious to have me associated with\r\nhis theatre, that he might have some one to support him who was\r\nfavourably disposed towards the new singers.\r\n\r\nAll this sounded so plausible, that I could scarcely be blamed for\r\nbelieving that the wheel of fortune had taken a favourable turn for me,\r\nand for feeling a sense of lightheartedness at the thought of such rosy\r\nprospects. I had scarcely allowed myself the few modifications in my\r\nmanner of living which these improved circumstances seemed to justify,\r\nere it was made clear to me that my hopes were built upon sand. I was\r\nfilled with positive dread when I soon fully realised how nearly Cerf\r\nhad come to defrauding me, merely it would seem for his own amusement.\r\nAfter the manner of despots, he had given his favours personally and\r\nautocratically; the withdrawal and annulment of his promises, however,\r\nhe made known to me through his servants and secretaries, thus placing\r\nhis strange conduct towards me in the light of the inevitable result of\r\nhis dependence upon officialdom.\r\n\r\nAs Cerf wished to rid himself of me without even offering me\r\ncompensation, I was obliged to try to come to some understanding\r\nregarding all that had been definitely arranged between us, and this\r\nwith the very people against whom he had previously warned me and had\r\nwanted me to side with him. The conductor, stage manager, secretary,\r\netc., had to make it clear to me that my wishes could not be satisfied,\r\nand that the director owed me no compensation whatever for the time he\r\nhad made me waste while awaiting the fulfilment of his promises. This\r\nunpleasant experience has been a source of pain to me ever since.\r\n\r\nOwing to all this my position was very much worse than it had been\r\nbefore. Minna wrote to me frequently from Königsberg, but she had\r\nnothing encouraging to tell me with regard to my hopes in that\r\ndirection. The director of the theatre there seemed unable to come to\r\nany clear understanding with his conductor, a circumstance which I was\r\nafterwards able to understand, but which at the time appeared to me\r\ninexplicable, and made my chance of obtaining the coveted appointment\r\nseem exceedingly remote. It seemed certain, however, that the post\r\nwould be vacant in the autumn, and as I was drifting about aimlessly in\r\nBerlin and refused for a moment to entertain the thought of returning\r\nto Leipzig, I snatched at this faint hope, and in imagination soared\r\nabove the Berlin quicksands to the safety of the harbour on the Baltic.\r\n\r\nI only succeeded in doing so, however, after I had struggled through\r\ndifficult and serious inward conflicts to which my relations with Minna\r\ngave rise. An incomprehensible feature in the character of this\r\notherwise apparently simple-minded woman had thrown my young heart into\r\na turmoil. A good-natured, well-to-do tradesman of Jewish extraction,\r\nnamed Schwabe, who till that time had been established in Magdeburg,\r\nmade friendly advances to me in Berlin, and I soon discovered that his\r\nsympathy was chiefly due to the passionate interest which he had\r\nconceived for Minna. It afterwards became clear to me that an intimacy\r\nhad existed between this man and Minna, which in itself could hardly be\r\nconsidered as a breach of faith towards me, since it had ended in a\r\ndecided repulse of my rival’s courtship in my favour. But the fact of\r\nthis episode having been kept so secret that I had not had the faintest\r\nidea of it before, and also the suspicion I could not avoid harbouring\r\nthat Minna’s comfortable circumstances were in part due to this man’s\r\nfriendship, filled me with gloomy misgivings. But as I have said,\r\nalthough I could find no real cause to complain of infidelity, I was\r\ndistracted and alarmed, and was at last driven to the half-desperate\r\nresolve of regaining my balance in this respect by obtaining complete\r\npossession of Minna. It seemed to me as though my stability as a\r\ncitizen as well as my professional success would be assured by a\r\nrecognised union with Minna. The two years spent in the theatrical\r\nworld had, in fact, kept me in a constant state of distraction, of\r\nwhich in my heart of hearts I was most painfully conscious. I realised\r\nvaguely that I was on the wrong path; I longed for peace and quiet, and\r\nhoped to find these most effectually by getting married, and so putting\r\nan end to the state of things that had become the source of so much\r\nanxiety to me.\r\n\r\nIt was not surprising that Laube noticed by my untidy, passionate, and\r\nwasted appearance that something unusual was amiss with me. It was only\r\nin his company, which I always found comforting, that I gained the only\r\nimpressions of Berlin which compensated me in any way for my\r\nmisfortunes. The most important artistic experience I had, came to me\r\nthrough the performance of Ferdinand Cortez, conducted by Spontini\r\nhimself, the spirit of which astonished me more than anything I had\r\never heard before. Though the actual production, especially as regards\r\nthe chief characters, who as a whole could not be regarded as belonging\r\nto the flower of Berlin opera, left me unmoved, and though the effect\r\nnever reached a point that could be even distantly compared to that\r\nproduced upon me by Schroder-Devrient, yet the exceptional precision,\r\nfire, and richly organised rendering of the whole was new to me. I\r\ngained a fresh insight into the peculiar dignity of big theatrical\r\nrepresentations, which in their several parts could, by\r\nwell-accentuated rhythm, be made to attain the highest pinnacle of art.\r\nThis extraordinarily distinct impression took a drastic hold of me, and\r\nabove all served to guide me in my conception of Rienzi, so that,\r\nspeaking from an artistic point of view, Berlin may be said to have\r\nleft its traces on my development.\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, my chief concern was to extricate myself from\r\nmy extremely helpless position. I was determined to turn my steps to\r\nKönigsberg, and communicated my decision, and the hopes founded upon\r\nit, to Laube. This excellent friend, without further inquiry, made a\r\npoint of exerting his energies to free me from my present state of\r\ndespair, and to help me to reach my next destination, an object which,\r\nthrough the assistance of several of his friends, he succeeded in\r\naccomplishing. When he said good-bye to me, Laube with sympathetic\r\nforesight warned me, should I succeed in my desired career of musical\r\nconductor, not to allow myself to be entangled in the shallowness of\r\nstage life, and advised me, after fatiguing rehearsals, instead of\r\ngoing to my sweetheart, to take a serious book in hand, in order that\r\nmy greater gifts might not go uncultivated. I did not tell him that by\r\ntaking an early and decisive step in this direction I intended to\r\nprotect myself effectually against the dangers of theatrical intrigues.\r\nOn the 7th of July, therefore, I started on what was at that time an\r\nextremely troublesome and fatiguing journey to the distant town of\r\nKönigsberg.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me as though I were leaving the world, as I travelled on\r\nday after day through the desert marches. Then followed a sad and\r\nhumiliating impression of Königsberg, where, in one of the\r\npoorest-looking suburbs, Tragheim, near the theatre, and in a lane such\r\nas one would expect to find in a village, I found the ugly house in\r\nwhich Minna lodged. The friendly and quiet kindness of manner, however,\r\nwhich was peculiar to her, soon made me feel at home. She was popular\r\nat the theatre, and was respected by the managers and actors, a fact\r\nwhich seemed to augur well for her betrothed, the part I was now openly\r\nto assume.\r\n\r\nThough as yet there seemed no distinct prospect of my getting the\r\nappointment I had come for, yet we agreed that I could hold out a\r\nlittle longer, and that the matter would certainly be arranged in the\r\nend. This was also the opinion of the eccentric Abraham Möller, a\r\nworthy citizen of Königsberg, who was devoted to the theatre, and who\r\ntook a very friendly interest in Minna, and finally also in me. This\r\nman, who was already well advanced in life, belonged to the type of\r\ntheatre lovers now probably completely extinct in Germany, but of whom\r\nso much is recorded in the history of actors of earlier times. One\r\ncould not spend an hour in the company of this man, who at one time had\r\ngone in for the most reckless speculations, without having to listen to\r\nhis account of the glory of the stage in former times, described in\r\nmost lively terms. As a man of means he had at one time made the\r\nacquaintance of nearly all the great actors and actresses of his day,\r\nand had even known how to win their friendship. Through too great a\r\nliberality he unfortunately found himself in reduced circumstances, and\r\nwas now obliged to procure the means to satisfy his craving for the\r\ntheatre and his desire to protect those belonging to it by entering\r\ninto all kinds of strange business transactions, in which, without\r\nrunning any real risk, he felt there was something to be gained. He was\r\naccordingly only able to afford the theatre a very meagre support, but\r\none which was quite in keeping with its decrepit condition.\r\n\r\nThis strange man, of whom the theatre director, Anton Hubsch, stood to\r\na certain extent in awe, undertook to procure me my appointment. The\r\nonly circumstance against me was the fact that Louis Schubert, the\r\nfamous musician whom I had known from very early times as the first\r\nvioloncellist of the Magdeburg orchestra, had come to Königsberg from\r\nRiga, where the theatre had been closed for a time, and where he had\r\nleft his wife, in order to fill the post of musical conductor here\r\nuntil the new theatre in Riga was opened, and he could return. The\r\nreopening of the Riga theatre, which had already been fixed for the\r\nEaster of this year, had been postponed, and he was now anxious not to\r\nleave Königsberg. Since Schubert was a thorough master in his art, and\r\nsince his choosing to remain or go depended entirely on circumstances\r\nover which he had no control, the theatre director found himself in the\r\nembarrassing position of having to secure some one who would be willing\r\nto wait to enter upon his appointment till Schubert’s business called\r\nhim away. Consequently a young musical conductor who was anxious to\r\nremain in Königsberg at any price could but be heartily welcomed as a\r\nreserve and substitute in case of emergency. Indeed, the director\r\ndeclared himself willing to give me a small retaining fee till the time\r\nshould arrive for my definite entrance upon my duties.\r\n\r\nSchubert, on the contrary, was furious at my arrival; there was no\r\nlonger any necessity for his speedy return to Riga, since the reopening\r\nof the theatre there had been postponed indefinitely. Moreover, he had\r\na special interest in remaining in Königsberg, as he had conceived a\r\npassion for the prima donna there, which considerably lessened his\r\ndesire to return to his wife. So at the last moment he clung to his\r\nKönigsberg post with great eagerness, regarded me as his deadly enemy,\r\nand, spurred on by his instinct of self-preservation, used every means\r\nin his power to make my stay in Königsberg, and the already painful\r\nposition I occupied while awaiting his departure, a veritable hell to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nWhile in Magdeburg I had been on the friendliest footing with both\r\nmusicians and singers, and had been shown the greatest consideration by\r\nthe public, I here found I had to defend myself on all sides against\r\nthe most mortifying ill-will. This hostility towards me, which soon\r\nmade itself apparent, contributed in no small degree to make me feel as\r\nthough in coming to Königsberg I had gone into exile. In spite of my\r\neagerness, I realised that under the circumstances my marriage with\r\nMinna would prove a hazardous undertaking. At the beginning of August\r\nthe company went to Memel for a time, to open the summer season there,\r\nand I followed Minna a few days later. We went most of the way by sea,\r\nand crossed the Kurische Haff in a sailing vessel in bad weather with\r\nthe wind against us—one of the most melancholy crossings I have ever\r\nexperienced. As we passed the thin strip of sand that divides this bay\r\nfrom the Baltic Sea, the castle of Runsitten, where Hoffmann laid the\r\nscene of one of his most gruesome tales (Das Majorat), was pointed out\r\nto me. The fact that in this desolate neighbourhood, of all places in\r\nthe world, I should after so long a lapse of time be once more brought\r\nin contact with the fantastic impressions of my youth, had a singular\r\nand depressing effect on my mind. The unhappy sojourn in Memel, the\r\nlamentable role I played there, everything in short, contributed to\r\nmake me find my only consolation in Minna, who, after all, was the\r\ncause of my having placed myself in this unpleasant position. Our\r\nfriend Abraham followed us from Königsberg and did all kinds of queer\r\nthings to promote my interests, and was obviously anxious to put the\r\ndirector and conductor at variance with each other. One day Schubert,\r\nin consequence of a dispute with Hubsch on the previous night, actually\r\ndeclared himself too unwell to attend a rehearsal of Euryanthe, in\r\norder to force the manager to summon me suddenly to take his place. In\r\ndoing this my rival maliciously hoped that as I was totally unprepared\r\nto conduct this difficult opera, which was seldom played, I would\r\nexpose my incapacity in a manner most welcome to his hostile\r\nintentions. Although I had never really had a score of Euryanthe before\r\nme, his wish was so little gratified, that he elected to get well for\r\nthe representation in order to conduct it himself, which he would not\r\nhave done if it had been found necessary to cancel the performance on\r\naccount of my incompetence. In this wretched position, vexed in mind,\r\nexposed to the severe climate, which even on summer evenings struck me\r\nas horribly cold, and occupied merely in warding off the most painful\r\ntroubles of life, my time, as far as any professional advancement was\r\nconcerned, was completely lost. At last, on our return to Königsberg,\r\nand particularly under the guardianship of Möller, the question as to\r\nwhat was to be done was more earnestly considered. Finally, Minna and I\r\nwere offered a fairly good engagement in Danzig, through the influence\r\nof my brother-in-law Wolfram and his wife, who had gone there.\r\n\r\nMöller seized this opportunity to induce the director Hubsch, who was\r\nanxious not to lose Minna, to sign a contract including us both, and by\r\nwhich it was understood that under any circumstances I should be\r\nofficially appointed as conductor at his theatre from the following\r\nEaster. Moreover, for our wedding, a benefit performance was promised,\r\nfor which we chose Die Stumme von Portici, to be conducted by me in\r\nperson. For, as Möller remarked, it was absolutely necessary for us to\r\nget married, and to have a due celebration of the event; there was no\r\ngetting out of it. Minna made no objection, and all my past endeavours\r\nand resolutions seemed to prove that my one desire was to take anchor\r\nin the haven of matrimony. In spite of this, however, a strange\r\nconflict was going on within me at this time. I had become sufficiently\r\nintimate with Minna’s life and character to realise the wide difference\r\nbetween our two natures as fully as the important step I was about to\r\ntake necessitated; but my powers of judgment were not yet sufficiently\r\nmatured.\r\n\r\nMy future wife was the child of poor parents, natives of Oederan in the\r\nErzgebirge in Saxony. Her father was no ordinary man; he possessed\r\nenormous vitality, but in his old age showed traces of some feebleness\r\nof mind. In his young days he had been a trumpeter in Saxony, and in\r\nthis capacity had taken part in a campaign against the French, and had\r\nalso been present at the battle of Wagram. He afterwards became a\r\nmechanic, and took up the trade of manufacturing cards for carding\r\nwool, and as he invented an improvement in the process of their\r\nproduction, he is said to have made a very good business of it for some\r\ntime. A rich manufacturer of Chemnitz once gave him a large order to be\r\ndelivered at the end of the year: the children, whose pliable fingers\r\nhad already proved serviceable in this respect, had to work hard day\r\nand night, and in return the father promised them an exceptionally\r\nhappy Christmas, as he expected to get a large sum of money. When the\r\nlonged-for time arrived, however, he received the announcement of his\r\nclient’s bankruptcy. The goods that had already been delivered were\r\nlost, and the material that remained on his hands there was no prospect\r\nof selling. The family never succeeded in recovering from the state of\r\nconfusion into which this misfortune had thrown them; they went to\r\nDresden, where the father hoped to find remunerative employment as a\r\nskilled mechanic, especially in the manufacture of pianos, of which he\r\nsupplied separate parts. He also brought away with him a large quantity\r\nof the fine wire which had been destined for the manufacture of the\r\ncards, and which he hoped to be able to sell at a profit. The\r\nten-year-old Minna was commissioned to sell separate lots of it to the\r\nmilliners for making flowers. She would set out with a heavy basketful\r\nof wire, and had such a gift for persuading people to buy that she soon\r\ndisposed of the whole supply to the best advantage. From this time the\r\ndesire was awakened in her to be of active use to her impoverished\r\nfamily, and to earn her own living as soon as possible, in order not to\r\nbe a burden on her parents. As she grew up and developed into a\r\nstrikingly beautiful woman, she attracted the attention of men at a\r\nvery early age. A certain Herr von Einsiedel fell passionately in love\r\nwith her, and took advantage of the inexperienced young girl when she\r\nwas off her guard. Her family was thrown into the utmost consternation,\r\nand only her mother and elder sister could be told of the terrible\r\nposition in which Minna found herself. Her father, from whose anger the\r\nworst consequences were to be feared, was never informed that his\r\nbarely seventeen-year-old daughter had become a mother, and under\r\nconditions that had threatened her life, had given birth to a girl.\r\nMinna, who could obtain no redress from her seducer, now felt doubly\r\ncalled upon to earn her own livelihood and leave her father’s house.\r\nThrough the influence of friends, she had been brought into contact\r\nwith an amateur theatrical society: while acting in a performance given\r\nthere, she attracted the notice of members of the Royal Court Theatre,\r\nand in particular drew the attention of the director of the Dessau\r\nCourt Theatre, who was present, and who immediately offered her an\r\nengagement. She gladly caught at this way of escape from her trying\r\nposition, as it opened up the possibility of a brilliant stage career,\r\nand of some day being able to provide amply for her family. She had not\r\nthe slightest passion for the stage, and utterly devoid as she was of\r\nany levity or coquetry, she merely saw in a theatrical career the means\r\nof earning a quick, and possibly even a rich, livelihood. Without any\r\nartistic training, the theatre merely meant for her the company of\r\nactors and actresses. Whether she pleased or not seemed of importance\r\nin her eyes only in so far as it affected her realisation of a\r\ncomfortable independence. To use all the means at her disposal to\r\nassure this end seemed to her as necessary as it is for a tradesman to\r\nexpose his goods to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nThe friendship of the director, manager, and favourite members of the\r\ntheatre she regarded as indispensable, whilst those frequenters of the\r\ntheatre who, through their criticism or taste, influenced the public,\r\nand thus also had weight with the management, she recognised as beings\r\nupon whom the attainment of her most fervent desires depended. Never to\r\nmake enemies of them appeared so natural and so necessary that, in\r\norder to maintain her popularity, she was prepared to sacrifice even\r\nher self-respect. She had in this way created for herself a certain\r\npeculiar code of behaviour, that on the one hand prompted her to avoid\r\nscandals, but on the other hand found excuses even for making herself\r\nconspicuous as long as she herself knew that she was doing nothing\r\nwrong. Hence arose a mixture of inconsistencies, the questionable sense\r\nof which she was incapable of grasping. It was clearly impossible for\r\nher not to lose all real sense of delicacy; she showed, however, a\r\nsense of the fitness of things, which made her have regard to what was\r\nconsidered proper, though she could not understand that mere\r\nappearances were a mockery when they only served to cloak the absence\r\nof a real sense of delicacy. As she was without idealism, she had no\r\nartistic feeling; neither did she possess any talent for acting, and\r\nher power of pleasing was due entirely to her charming appearance.\r\nWhether in time routine would have made her become a good actress it is\r\nimpossible for me to say. The strange power she exercised over me from\r\nthe very first was in no wise due to the fact that I regarded her in\r\nany way as the embodiment of my ideal; on the contrary, she attracted\r\nme by the soberness and seriousness of her character, which\r\nsupplemented what I felt to be wanting in my own, and afforded me the\r\nsupport that in my wanderings after the ideal I knew to be necessary\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nI had soon accustomed myself never to betray my craving after the ideal\r\nbefore Minna: unable to account for this even to myself, I always made\r\na point of avoiding the subject by passing it over with a laugh and a\r\njoke; but, on this account, it was all the more natural for me to feel\r\nqualms when fears arose in my mind as to her really possessing the\r\nqualities to which I had attributed her superiority over me. Her\r\nstrange tolerance with regard to certain familiarities and even\r\nimportunities on the part of patrons of the theatre, directed even\r\nagainst her person, hurt me considerably; and on my reproaching her for\r\nthis, I was driven to despair by her assuming an injured expression as\r\nthough I had insulted her. It was quite by chance that I came across\r\nSchwabe’s letters, and thus gained an astonishing insight into her\r\nintimacy with that man, of which she had left me in ignorance, and\r\nallowed me to gain my first knowledge during my stay in Berlin. All my\r\nlatent jealousy, all my inmost doubts concerning Minna’s character,\r\nfound vent in my sudden determination to leave the girl at once. There\r\nwas a violent scene between us, which was typical of all our subsequent\r\naltercations. I had obviously gone too far in treating a woman who was\r\nnot passionately in love with me, as if I had a real right over her;\r\nfor, after all, she had merely yielded to my importunity, and in no way\r\nbelonged to me. To add to my perplexity, Minna only needed to remind me\r\nthat from a worldly point of view she had refused very good offers in\r\norder to give way to the impetuosity of a penniless young man, whose\r\ntalent had not yet been put to any real test, and to whom she had\r\nnevertheless shown sympathy and kindness.\r\n\r\nWhat she could least forgive in me was the raging vehemence with which\r\nI spoke, and by which she felt so insulted, that upon realising to what\r\nexcesses I had gone, there was nothing I could do but try and pacify\r\nher by owning myself in the wrong, and begging her forgiveness. Such\r\nwas the end of this and all subsequent scenes, outwardly; at least,\r\nalways to her advantage. But peace was undermined for ever, and by the\r\nfrequent recurrence of such quarrels, Minna’s character underwent a\r\nconsiderable change. Just as in later times she became perplexed by\r\nwhat she considered my incomprehensible conception of art and its\r\nproportions, which upset her ideas about everything connected with it,\r\nso now she grew more and more confused by my greater delicacy in regard\r\nto morality, which was very different from hers, especially as in many\r\nother respects I displayed a freedom of opinion which the could neither\r\ncomprehend nor approve.\r\n\r\nA feeling of passionate resentment was accordingly roused in her\r\notherwise tranquil disposition. It was not surprising that this\r\nresentment increased as the years went on, and manifested itself in a\r\nmanner characteristic of a girl sprung from the lower middle class, in\r\nwhom mere superficial polish had taken the place of any true culture.\r\nThe real torment of our subsequent life together lay in the fact that,\r\nowing to her violence, I had lost the last support I had hitherto found\r\nin her exceptionally sweet disposition. At that time I was filled only\r\nwith a dim foreboding of the fateful step I was taking in marrying her.\r\nHer agreeable and soothing qualities still had such a beneficial effect\r\nupon me, that with the frivolity natural to me, as well as the\r\nobstinacy with which I met all opposition, I silenced the inner voice\r\nthat darkly foreboded disaster.\r\n\r\nSince my journey to Königsberg I had broken off all communication with\r\nmy family, that is to say, with my mother and Rosalie, and I told no\r\none of the step I had decided to take. Under my old friend Möller’s\r\naudacious guidance I overcame all the legal difficulties that stood in\r\nthe way of our union. According to Prussian law, a man who has reached\r\nhis majority no longer requires his parents’ consent to his marriage:\r\nbut since, according to this same provision, I was not yet of age, I\r\nhad recourse to the law of Saxony, to which country I belonged by\r\nbirth, and by whose regulations I had already attained my majority at\r\nthe age of twenty-one. Our banns had to be published at the place where\r\nwe had been living during the past year, and this formality was carried\r\nout in Magdeburg without any further objections being raised. As\r\nMinna’s parents had given their consent, the only thing that still\r\nremained to be done to make everything quite in order was for us to go\r\ntogether to the clergyman of the parish of Tragheim. This proved a\r\nstrange enough visit. It took place the morning preceding the\r\nperformance to be given for our benefit, in which Minna had chosen, the\r\npantomimic role of Fenella; her costume was not ready yet, and there\r\nwas still a great deal to be done. The rainy cold November weather made\r\nus feel out of humour, when, to add to our vexation, we were kept\r\nstanding in the hall of the vicarage for an unreasonable time. Then an\r\naltercation arose between us which speedily led to such bitter\r\nvituperation that we were just on the point of separating and going\r\neach our own way, when the clergyman opened the door. Not a little\r\nembarrassed at having surprised us in the act of quarrelling, he\r\ninvited us in. We were obliged to put a good face on the matter,\r\nhowever; and the absurdity of the situation so tickled our sense of\r\nhumour that we laughed; the parson was appeased, and the wedding fixed\r\nfor eleven o’clock the next morning.\r\n\r\nAnother fruitful source of irritation, which often led to the outbreak\r\nof violent quarrelling between us, was the arrangement of our future\r\nhome, in the interior comfort and beauty of which I hoped to find a\r\nguarantee of happiness. The economical ideas of my bride filled me with\r\nimpatience. I was determined that the inauguration of a series of\r\nprosperous years which I saw before me must be celebrated by a\r\ncorrespondingly comfortable home. Furniture, household utensils, and\r\nall necessaries were obtained on credit, to be paid for by instalment.\r\nThere was, of course, no question of a dowry, a wedding outfit, or any\r\nof the things that are generally considered indispensable to a\r\nwell-founded establishment. Our witnesses and guests were drawn from\r\nthe company of actors accidentally brought together by their engagement\r\nat the Königsberg theatre. My friend Möller made us a present of a\r\nsilver sugar-basin, which was supplemented by a silver cake-basket from\r\nanother stage friend, a peculiar and, as far as I can remember, rather\r\ninteresting young man named Ernst Castell. The benefit performance of\r\nthe Die Stumme von Portici, which I conducted with great enthusiasm,\r\nwent off well, and brought us in as large a sum as we had counted upon.\r\nAfter spending the rest of the day before our wedding very quietly, as\r\nwe were tired out after our return from the theatre, I took up my abode\r\nfor the first time in our new home. Not wishing to use the bridal bed,\r\ndecorated for the occasion, I lay down on a hard sofa, without even\r\nsufficient covering on me, and froze valiantly while awaiting the\r\nhappiness of the following day. I was pleasantly excited the next\r\nmorning by the arrival of Minna’s belongings, packed in boxes and\r\nbaskets. The weather, too, had quite cleared up, and the sun was\r\nshining brightly; only our sitting-room refused to get properly warm,\r\nwhich for some time drew down Minna’s reproaches upon my head for my\r\nsupposed carelessness in not having seen to the heating arrangements.\r\nAt last I dressed myself in my new suit, a dark blue frock-coat with\r\ngold buttons. The carriage drove up, and I set out to fetch my bride.\r\nThe bright sky had put us all in good spirits, and in the best of\r\nhumour I met Minna, who was dressed in a splendid gown chosen by me.\r\nShe greeted me with sincere cordiality and pleasure shining from her\r\neyes; and taking the fine weather as a good omen, we started off for\r\nwhat now seemed to us a most cheerful wedding. We enjoyed the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the church as over-crowded as if a brilliant\r\ntheatrical representation were being given; it was quite a difficult\r\nmatter to make our way to the altar, where a group no less worldly than\r\nthe rest, consisting of our witnesses, dressed in all their theatrical\r\nfinery, were assembled to receive us. There was not one real friend\r\namongst all those present, for even our strange old friend Möller was\r\nabsent, because no suitable partner had been found for him. I was not\r\nfor a single moment insensible to the chilling frivolity of the\r\ncongregation, who seemed to impart their tone to the whole ceremony. I\r\nlistened like one in a dream to the nuptial address of the parson, who,\r\nI was afterwards told, had had a share in producing the spirit of\r\nbigotry which at this time was so prevalent in Königsberg, and which\r\nexercised such a disquieting influence on its population.\r\n\r\nA few days later I was told that a rumour had got about the town that I\r\nhad taken action against the parson for some gross insults contained in\r\nhis sermon; I did not quite see what was meant, but supposed that the\r\nexaggerated report arose from a passage in his address which I in my\r\nexcitement had misunderstood. The preacher, in speaking of the dark\r\ndays, of which we were to expect our share, bade us look to an unknown\r\nfriend, and I glanced up inquiringly for further particulars of this\r\nmysterious and influential patron who chose so strange a way of\r\nannouncing himself. Reproachfully, and with peculiar emphasis, the\r\npastor then pronounced the name of this unknown friend: Jesus. Now I\r\nwas not in any way insulted by this, as people imagined, but was simply\r\ndisappointed; at the same time, I thought that such exhortations were\r\nprobably usual in nuptial addresses.\r\n\r\nBut, on the whole, I was so absent-minded during this ceremony, which\r\nwas double Dutch to me, that when the parson held out the closed\r\nprayer-book for us to place our wedding rings upon, Minna had to nudge\r\nme forcibly to make me follow her example.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I saw, as clearly as in a vision, my whole being divided\r\ninto two cross-currents that dragged me in different directions; the\r\nupper one faced the sun and carried me onward like a dreamer, whilst\r\nthe lower one held my nature captive, a prey to some inexplicable fear.\r\nThe extraordinary levity with which I chased away the conviction which\r\nkept forcing itself upon me, that I was committing a twofold sin, was\r\namply accounted for by the really genuine affection with which I looked\r\nupon the young girl whose truly exceptional character (so rare in the\r\nenvironment in which she had been placed) led her thus to bind herself\r\nto a young man without any means of support. It was eleven o’clock on\r\nthe morning of the 24th of November, 1836, and I was twenty-three and a\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\nOn the way home from church, and afterwards, my good spirits rose\r\nsuperior to all my doubts.\r\n\r\nMinna at once took upon herself the duty of receiving and entertaining\r\nher guests. The table was spread, and a rich feast, at which Abraham\r\nMöller, the energetic promoter of our marriage, also took part,\r\nalthough he had been rather put out by his exclusion from the church\r\nceremony, made up for the coldness of the room, which for a long time\r\nrefused to get warm, to the great distress of the young hostess.\r\n\r\nEverything went off in the usual uneventful way. Nevertheless, I\r\nretained my good spirits till the next morning, when I had to present\r\nmyself at the magistrate’s court to meet the demands of my creditors,\r\nwhich had been forwarded to me from Magdeburg to Konigsburg.\r\n\r\nMy friend Möller, whom I had retained for my defence, had foolishly\r\nadvised me to meet my creditors’ demands by pleading infancy according\r\nto the law of Prussia, at all events until actual assistance for the\r\nsettlement of the claims could be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate, to whom I stated this plea as I had been advised, was\r\nastonished, being probably well aware of my marriage on the previous\r\nday, which could only have taken place on the production of documentary\r\nproof of my majority. I naturally only gained a brief respite by this\r\nmanœuvre, and the troubles which beset me for a long time afterwards\r\nhad their origin on the first day of my marriage.\r\n\r\nDuring the period when I held no appointment at the theatre I suffered\r\nvarious humiliations. Nevertheless, I thought it wise to make the most\r\nof my leisure in the interests of my art, and I finished a few pieces,\r\namong which was a grand overture on Rule Britannia.\r\n\r\nWhen I was still in Berlin I had written the overture entitled Polonia,\r\nwhich has already been mentioned in connection with the Polish\r\nfestival. Rule Britannia was a further and deliberate step in the\r\ndirection of mass effects; at the close a strong military band was to\r\nbe added to the already over-full orchestra, and I intended to have the\r\nwhole thing performed at the Musical Festival in Königsberg in the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nTo these two overtures I added a supplement—an overture entitled\r\nNapoleon. The point to which I devoted my chief attention was the\r\nselection of the means for producing certain effects, and I carefully\r\nconsidered whether I should express the annihilating stroke of fate\r\nthat befell the French Emperor in Russia by a beat on the tom-tom or\r\nnot. I believe it was to a great extent my scruples about the\r\nintroduction of this beat that prevented me from carrying out my plan\r\njust then.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the conclusions which I had reached regarding the\r\nill-success of Liebesverbot resulted in an operatic sketch in which the\r\ndemands made on the chorus and the staff of singers should be more in\r\nproportion to the known capacity of the local company, as this small\r\ntheatre was the only one at my disposal.\r\n\r\nA quaint tale from the Arabian Nights suggested the very subject for a\r\nlight work of this description, the title of which, if I remember\r\nrightly, was Mannerlist grosser als Frauenlist (‘Man outwits Woman’).\r\n\r\nI transplanted the story from Bagdad to a modern setting. A young\r\ngoldsmith offends the pride of a young woman by placing the above motto\r\non the sign over his shop; deeply veiled, she steps into his shop and\r\nasks him, as he displays such excellent taste in his work, to express\r\nhis opinion on her own physical charms; he begins with her feet and her\r\nhands, and finally, noticing his confusion, she removes the veil from\r\nher face. The jeweller is carried away by her beauty, whereupon she\r\ncomplains to him that her father, who has always kept her in the\r\nstrictest seclusion, describes her to all her suitors as an ugly\r\nmonster, his object being, she imagines, simply to keep her dowry. The\r\nyoung man swears that he will not be frightened off by these foolish\r\nobjections, should the father raise them against his suit. No sooner\r\nsaid than done. The daughter of this peculiar old gentleman is promised\r\nto the unsuspecting jeweller, and is brought to her bridegroom as soon\r\nas he has signed the contract. He then sees that the father has indeed\r\nspoken the truth, the real daughter being a perfect scarecrow. The\r\nbeautiful lady returns to the bridegroom to gloat over his desperation,\r\nand promises to release him from his terrible marriage if he will\r\nremove the motto from his signboard. At this point I departed from the\r\noriginal, and continued as follows: The enraged jeweller is on the\r\npoint of tearing down his unfortunate signboard when a curious\r\napparition leads him to pause in the act. He sees a bear-leader in the\r\nstreet making his clumsy beast dance, in whom the luckless lover\r\nrecognises at a glance his own father, from whom he has been parted by\r\na hard fate.\r\n\r\nHe suppresses any sign of emotion, for in a flash a scheme occurs to\r\nhim by which he can utilise this discovery to free himself from the\r\nhated marriage with the daughter of the proud old aristocrat.\r\n\r\nHe instructs the bear-leader to come that evening to the garden where\r\nthe solemn betrothal is to take place in the presence of the invited\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nHe then explains to his young enemy that he wishes to leave the\r\nsignboard up for the time being, as he still hopes to prove the truth\r\nof the motto.\r\n\r\nAfter the marriage contract, in which the young man arrogates to\r\nhimself all kinds of fictitious titles of nobility, has been read to\r\nthe assembled company (composed, say, of the elite of the noble\r\nimmigrants at the time of the French Revolution), there is heard\r\nsuddenly the pipe of the bear-leader, who enters the garden with his\r\nprancing beast. Angered by this trivial diversion, the astonished\r\ncompany become indignant when the bridegroom, giving free vent to his\r\nfeelings, throws himself with tears of joy into the arms of the\r\nbear-leader and loudly proclaims him as his long-lost father. The\r\nconsternation of the company becomes even greater, however, when the\r\nbear itself embraces the man they supposed to be of noble birth, for\r\nthe beast is no less a person than his own brother in the flesh who, on\r\nthe death of the real bear, had donned its skin, thus enabling the\r\npoverty-stricken pair to continue to earn their livelihood in the only\r\nway left to them. This public disclosure of the bridegroom’s lowly\r\norigin at once dissolves the marriage, and the young woman, declaring\r\nherself outwitted by man, offers her hand in compensation to the\r\nreleased jeweller.\r\n\r\nTo this unassuming subject I gave the title of the Gluckliche\r\nBarenfamilie, and provided it with a dialogue which afterwards met with\r\nHoltei’s highest approval.\r\n\r\nI was about to begin the music for it in a new light French style, but\r\nthe seriousness of my position, which grew more and more acute,\r\nprevented further progress in my work.\r\n\r\nIn this respect my strained relations with the conductor of the theatre\r\nwere still a constant source of trouble. With neither the opportunity\r\nnor the means to defend myself, I had to submit to being maligned and\r\nrendered an object of suspicion on all sides by my rival, who remained\r\nmaster of the field. The object of this was to disgust me with the idea\r\nof taking up my appointment as musical conductor, for which the\r\ncontract had been signed for Easter. Though I did not lose my\r\nself-confidence, I suffered keenly from the indignity and the\r\ndepressing effect of this prolonged strain.\r\n\r\nWhen at last, at the beginning of April, the moment arrived for the\r\nmusical conductor Schubert to resign, and for me to take over the whole\r\ncharge, he had the melancholy satisfaction of knowing that not only was\r\nthe standing of the opera seriously weakened by the departure of the\r\nprima donna, but that there was good reason to doubt whether the\r\ntheatre could be carried on at all. This month of Lent, which was such\r\na bad time in Germany for all similar theatrical enterprises, decimated\r\nthe Königsberg audience with the rest. The director took the greatest\r\ntrouble imaginable to fill up the gaps in the staff of the opera by\r\nmeans of engaging strangers temporarily, and by new acquisitions, and\r\nin this my personality and unflagging activity were of real service; I\r\ndevoted all my energy to buoying up by word and deed the tattered ship\r\nof the theatre, in which I now had a hand for the first time.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I had to try and keep cool under the most violent\r\ntreatment by a clique of students, among whom my predecessor had raised\r\nup enemies for me; and by the unerring certainty of my conducting I had\r\nto overcome the initial opposition of the orchestra, which had been set\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\nAfter laboriously laying the foundation of personal respect, I was now\r\nforced to realise that the business methods of the director, Hubsch,\r\nhad already involved too great a sacrifice to permit the theatre to\r\nmake its way against the unfavourableness of the season, and in May he\r\nadmitted to me that he had come to the point of being obliged to close\r\nthe theatre.\r\n\r\nBy summoning up all my eloquence, and by making suggestions which\r\npromised a happy issue, I was able to induce him to persevere;\r\nnevertheless, this was only possible by making demands on the loyalty\r\nof his company, who were asked to forego part of their salaries for a\r\ntime. This aroused general bitterness on the part of the uninitiated,\r\nand I found myself in the curious position of being forced to place the\r\ndirector in a favourable light to those who were hard hit by these\r\nmeasures, while I myself and my position were affected in such a manner\r\nthat my situation became daily more unendurable under the accumulation\r\nof intolerable difficulties taking their root in my past.\r\n\r\nBut though I did not even then lose courage, Minna, who as my wife was\r\nrobbed of all that she had a right to expect, found this turn of fate\r\nquite unbearable. The hidden canker of our married life which, even\r\nbefore our marriage, had caused me the most terrible anxiety and led to\r\nviolent scenes, reached its full growth under these sad conditions. The\r\nless I was able to maintain the standard of comfort due to our position\r\nby working and making the most of my talents, the more did Minna, to my\r\ninsufferable shame, consider it necessary to take this burden upon\r\nherself by making the most of her personal popularity. The discovery of\r\nsimilar condescensions—as I used to call them—on Minna’s part, had\r\nrepeatedly led to revolting scenes, and only her peculiar conception of\r\nher professional position and the needs it involved had made a\r\ncharitable interpretation possible.\r\n\r\nI was absolutely unable to bring my young wife to see my point of view,\r\nor to make her realise my own wounded feelings on these occasions,\r\nwhile the unrestrained violence of my speech and behaviour made an\r\nunderstanding once and for all impossible. These scenes frequently sent\r\nmy wife into convulsions of so alarming a nature that, as will easily\r\nbe realised, the satisfaction of reconciling her once more was all that\r\nremained to me. Certain it was that our mutual attitude became more and\r\nmore incomprehensible and inexplicable to us both.\r\n\r\nThese quarrels, which now became more frequent and more distressing,\r\nmay have gone far to diminish the strength of any affection which Minna\r\nwas able to give me, but I had no idea that she was only waiting for a\r\nfavourable opportunity to come to a desperate decision.\r\n\r\nTo fill the place of tenor in our company, I had summoned Friedrich\r\nSchmitt to Königsberg, a friend of my first year in Magdeburg, to whom\r\nallusion has already been made. He was sincerely devoted to me, and\r\nhelped me as much as possible in overcoming the dangers which\r\nthreatened the prosperity of the theatre as well as my own position.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of being on friendly terms with the public made me much\r\nless reserved and cautious in making new acquaintances, especially when\r\nin his company.\r\n\r\nA rich merchant, of the name of Dietrich, had recently constituted\r\nhimself a patron of the theatre, and especially of the women. With due\r\ndeference to the men with whom they were connected, he used to invite\r\nthe pick of these ladies to dinner at his house, and affected, on these\r\noccasions, the well-to-do Englishman, which was the beau-ideal for\r\nGerman merchants, especially in the manufacturing towns of the north.\r\n\r\nI had shown my annoyance at the acceptance of the invitation, sent to\r\nus among the rest, at first simply because his looks were repugnant to\r\nme. Minna considered this very unjust. Anyhow, I set my face decidedly\r\nagainst continuing our acquaintance with this man, and although Minna\r\ndid not insist on receiving him, my conduct towards the intruder was\r\nthe cause of angry scenes between us.\r\n\r\nOne day Friedrich Schmitt considered it his duty to inform me that this\r\nHerr Dietrich had spoken of me at a public dinner in such a manner as\r\nto lead every one to suppose that he had a suspicious intimacy with my\r\nwife. I felt obliged to suspect Minna of having, in some way unknown to\r\nme, told the fellow about my conduct towards her, as well as about our\r\nprecarious position.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Schmitt, I called this dangerous person to account on\r\nthe subject in his own home. At first this only led to the usual\r\ndenials. Afterwards, however, he sent secret communications to Minna\r\nconcerning the interview, thus providing her with a supposed new\r\ngrievance against me in the form of my inconsiderate treatment of her.\r\n\r\nOur relations now reached a critical stage, and on certain points we\r\npreserved silence.\r\n\r\nAt the same time—it was towards the end of May, 1837—the business\r\naffairs of the theatre had reached the crisis above mentioned, when the\r\nmanagement was obliged to fall back on the self-sacrificing\r\nco-operation of the staff to assure the continuance of the undertaking.\r\nAs I have said before, my own position at the end of a year so\r\ndisastrous to my welfare was seriously affected by this; nevertheless,\r\nthere seemed to be no alternative for me but to face these difficulties\r\npatiently, and relying on the faithful Friedrich Schmitt, but ignoring\r\nMinna, I began to take the necessary steps for making my post at\r\nKönigsberg secure. This, as well as the arduous part I took in the\r\nbusiness of the theatre, kept me so busy and so much away from home,\r\nthat I was not able to pay any particular attention to Minna’s silence\r\nand reserve.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 31st of May I took leave of Minna, expecting to\r\nbe detained till late in the afternoon by rehearsals and business\r\nmatters. With my entire approval she had for some time been accustomed\r\nto have her daughter Nathalie, who was supposed by every one to be her\r\nyoungest sister, to stay with her.\r\n\r\nAs I was about to wish them my usual quiet good-bye, the two women\r\nrushed after me to the door and embraced me passionately, Minna as well\r\nas her daughter bursting into tears. I was alarmed, and asked the\r\nmeaning of this excitement, but could get no answer from them, and I\r\nwas obliged to leave them and ponder alone over their peculiar conduct,\r\nof the reason for which I had not even the faintest idea.\r\n\r\nI arrived home late in the afternoon, worn out by my exertions and\r\nworries, dead-tired, pale and hungry, and was surprised to find the\r\ntable not laid and Minna not at home, the maid telling me that she had\r\nnot yet returned from her walk with Nathalie.\r\n\r\nI waited patiently, sinking down exhausted at the work-table, which I\r\nabsent-mindedly opened. To my intense astonishment it was empty.\r\nHorror-struck, I sprang up and went to the wardrobe, and realised at\r\nonce that Minna had left the house; her departure had been so cunningly\r\nplanned that even the maid was unaware of it.\r\n\r\nWith death in my soul I dashed out of the house to investigate the\r\ncause of Minna’s disappearance.\r\n\r\nOld Möller, by his practical sagacity, very soon found out that\r\nDietrich, his personal enemy, had left Königsberg in the direction of\r\nBerlin by the special coach in the morning.\r\n\r\nThis horrible fact stood staring me in the face.\r\n\r\nI had now to try and overtake the fugitives. With the lavish use of\r\nmoney this might have been possible, but funds were lacking, and had,\r\nin part, to be laboriously collected.\r\n\r\nOn Möller’s advice I took the silver wedding presents with me in case\r\nof emergency, and after the lapse of a few terrible hours went off,\r\nalso by special coach, with my distressed old friend. We hoped to\r\novertake the ordinary mail-coach, which had started a short time\r\nbefore, as it was probable that Minna would also continue her journey\r\nin this, at a safe distance from Königsberg.\r\n\r\nThis proved impossible, and when next morning at break of day we\r\narrived in Elbing, we found our money exhausted by the lavish use of\r\nthe express coach, and were compelled to return; we discovered,\r\nmoreover, that even by using the ordinary coach we should be obliged to\r\npawn the sugar-basin and cake-dish.\r\n\r\nThis return journey to Königsberg rightly remains one of the saddest\r\nmemories of my youth. Of course, I did not for a moment entertain the\r\nidea of remaining in the place; my one thought was how I could best get\r\naway. Hemmed in between the law-suits of my Magdeburg creditors and the\r\nKönigsberg tradesmen, who had claims on me for the payment by\r\ninstalment of my domestic accounts, my departure could only be carried\r\nout in secrecy. For this very reason, too, it was necessary for me to\r\nraise money, particularly for the long journey from Königsberg to\r\nDresden, whither I determined to go in quest of my wife, and these\r\nmatters detained me for two long and terrible days.\r\n\r\nI received no news whatever from Minna; from Möller I ascertained that\r\nshe had gone to Dresden, and that Dietrich had only accompanied her for\r\na short distance on the excuse of helping her in a friendly way.\r\n\r\nI succeeded in assuring myself that she really only wished to get away\r\nfrom a position that filled her with desperation, and for this purpose\r\nhad accepted the assistance of a man who sympathised with her, and that\r\nshe was for the present seeking rest and shelter with her parents. My\r\nfirst indignation at the event accordingly subsided to such an extent\r\nthat I gradually acquired more sympathy for her in her despair, and\r\nbegan to reproach myself both for my conduct and for having brought\r\nunhappiness on her.\r\n\r\nI became so convinced of the correctness of this view during the\r\ntedious journey to Dresden via Berlin, which I eventually undertook on\r\nthe 3rd of June, that when at last I found Minna at the humble abode of\r\nher parents, I was really quite unable to express anything but\r\nrepentence and heartbroken sympathy.\r\n\r\nIt was quite true that Minna thought herself badly treated by me, and\r\ndeclared that she had only been forced to take this desperate step by\r\nbrooding over our impossible position, to which she thought me both\r\nblind and deaf. Her parents were not pleased to see me: the painfully\r\nexcited condition of their daughter seemed to afford sufficient\r\njustification for her complaints against me. Whether my own sufferings,\r\nmy hasty pursuit, and the heartfelt expression of my grief made any\r\nfavourable impression on her, I can really hardly say, as her manner\r\ntowards me was very confused and, to a certain extent,\r\nincomprehensible. Still she was impressed when I told her that there\r\nwas a good prospect of my obtaining the post of musical conductor at\r\nRiga, where a new theatre was about to be opened under the most\r\nfavourable conditions. I felt that I must not press for new resolutions\r\nconcerning the regulation of our future relations just then, but must\r\nstrive the more earnestly to lay a better foundation for them.\r\nConsequently, after spending a fearful week with my wife under the most\r\npainful conditions, I went to Berlin, there to sign my agreement with\r\nthe new director of the Riga theatre. I obtained the appointment on\r\nfairly favourable terms which, I saw, would enable me to keep house in\r\nsuch a style that Minna could retire from the theatre altogether. By\r\nthis means she would be in a position to spare me all humiliation and\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Dresden, I found that Minna was ready to lend a willing\r\near to my proposed plans, and I succeeded in inducing her to leave her\r\nparents’ house, which was very cramped for us, and to establish herself\r\nin the country at Blasewitz, near Dresden, to await our removal to\r\nRiga. We found modest lodgings at an inn on the Elbe, in the farm-yard\r\nof which I had often played as a child. Here Minna’s frame of mind\r\nreally seemed to be improving. She had begged me not to press her too\r\nhard, and I spared her as much as possible. After a few weeks I thought\r\nI might consider the period of uneasiness past, but was surprised to\r\nfind the situation growing worse again without any apparent reason.\r\nMinna then told me of some advantageous offers she had received from\r\ndifferent theatres, and astonished me one day by announcing her\r\nintention of taking a short pleasure trip with a girl friend and her\r\nfamily. As I felt obliged to avoid putting any restraint upon her, I\r\noffered no objection to the execution of this project, which entailed a\r\nweek’s separation, but accompanied her back to her parents myself,\r\npromising to await her return quietly at Blasewitz. A few days later\r\nher eldest sister called to ask me for the written permission required\r\nto make out a passport for my wife. This alarmed me, and I went to\r\nDresden to ask her parents what their daughter was about. There, to my\r\nsurprise, I met with a very unpleasant reception; they reproached me\r\ncoarsely for my behaviour to Minna, whom they said I could not even\r\nmanage to support, and when I only replied by asking for information as\r\nto the whereabouts of my wife, and about her plans for the future, I\r\nwas put off with improbable statements. Tormented by the sharpest\r\nforebodings, and understanding nothing of what had occurred, I went\r\nback to the village, where I found a letter from Königsberg, from\r\nMöller, which poured light on all my misery. Herr Dietrich had gone to\r\nDresden, and I was told the name of the hotel at which he was staying.\r\nThe terrible illumination thrown by this communication upon Minna’s\r\nconduct showed me in a flash what to do. I hurried into town to make\r\nthe necessary inquiries at the hotel mentioned, and found that the man\r\nin question had been there, but had moved on again. He had vanished,\r\nand Minna too! I now knew enough to demand of the Fates why, at such an\r\nearly age, they had sent me this terrible experience which, as it\r\nseemed to me, had poisoned my whole existence.\r\n\r\nI sought consolation for my boundless grief in the society of my sister\r\nOttilie and her husband, Hermann Brockhaus, an excellent fellow to whom\r\nshe had been married for some years. They were then living at their\r\npretty summer villa in the lovely Grosser Garten, near Dresden. I had\r\nlooked them up at once the first time I went to Dresden, but as I had\r\nnot at that time the slightest idea of how things were going to turn\r\nout, I had told them nothing, and had seen but little of them. Now I\r\nwas moved to break my obstinate silence, and unfold to them the cause\r\nof my misery, with but few reservations.\r\n\r\nFor the first time I was in a position gratefully to appreciate the\r\nadvantages of family intercourse, and of the direct and disinterested\r\nintimacy between blood relations. Explanations were hardly necessary,\r\nand as brother and sister we found ourselves as closely linked now as\r\nwe had been when we were children. We arrived at a complete\r\nunderstanding without having to explain what we meant; I was unhappy,\r\nshe was happy; consolation and help followed as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nThis was the sister to whom I once had read Leubald und Adelaïde in a\r\nthunderstorm; the sister who had listened, filled with astonishment and\r\nsympathy, to that eventful performance of my first overture on\r\nChristmas Eve, and whom I now found married to one of the kindest of\r\nmen, Hermann Brockhaus, who soon earned a reputation for himself as an\r\nexpert in oriental languages. He was the youngest brother of my elder\r\nbrother-in-law, Friedrich Brockhaus. Their union was blessed by two\r\nchildren; their comfortable means favoured a life free from care, and\r\nwhen I made my daily pilgrimage from Blasewitz to the famous Grosser\r\nGarten, it was like stepping from a desert into paradise to enter their\r\nhouse (one of the popular villas), knowing that I would invariably find\r\na welcome in this happy family circle. Not only was my spirit soothed\r\nand benefited by intercourse with my sister, but my creative instincts,\r\nwhich had long lain dormant, were stimulated afresh by the society of\r\nmy brilliant and learned brother-in-law. It was brought home to me,\r\nwithout in any way hurting my feelings, that my early marriage,\r\nexcusable as it may have been, was yet an error to be retrieved, and my\r\nmind regained sufficient elasticity to compose some sketches, designed\r\nthis time not merely to meet the requirements of the theatre as I knew\r\nit. During the last wretched days I had spent with Minna at Blasewitz,\r\nI had read Bulwer Lytton’s novel, Rienzi; during my convalescence in\r\nthe bosom of my sympathetic family, I now worked out the scheme for a\r\ngrand opera under the inspiration of this book. Though obliged for the\r\npresent to return to the limitations of a small theatre, I tried from\r\nthis time onwards to aim at enlarging my sphere of action. I sent my\r\noverture, Rule Britannia, to the Philharmonic Society in London, and\r\ntried to get into communication with Scribe in Paris about a setting\r\nfor H. Konig’s novel, Die Hohe Braut, which I had sketched out.\r\n\r\nThus I spent the remainder of this summer of ever-happy memory. At the\r\nend of August I had to leave for Riga to take up my new appointment.\r\nAlthough I knew that my sister Rosalie had shortly before married the\r\nman of her choice, Professor Oswald Marbach of Leipzig, I avoided that\r\ncity, probably with the foolish notion of sparing myself any\r\nhumiliation, and went straight to Berlin, where I had to receive\r\ncertain additional instructions from my future director, and also to\r\nobtain my passport. There I met a younger sister of Minna’s, Amalie\r\nPlaner, a singer with a pretty voice, who had joined our opera company\r\nat Magdeburg for a short time. My report of Minna quite overwhelmed\r\nthis exceedingly kind-hearted girl. We went to a performance of Fidelia\r\ntogether, during which she, like myself, burst into tears and sobs.\r\nRefreshed by the sympathetic impression I had received, I went by way\r\nof Schwerin, where I was disappointed in my hopes of finding traces of\r\nMinna, to Lubeck, to wait for a merchant ship going to Riga. We had set\r\nsail for Travemunde when an unfavourable wind set in, and held up our\r\ndeparture for a week: I had to spend this disagreeable time in a\r\nmiserable ship’s tavern. Thrown on my own resources I tried, amongst\r\nother things, to read Till Eulenspiegel, and this popular book first\r\ngave me the idea of a real German comic opera. Long afterwards, when I\r\nwas composing the words for my Junger Siegfried, I remember having many\r\nvivid recollections of this melancholy sojourn in Travemunde and my\r\nreading of Till Eulenspiegel. After a voyage of four days we at last\r\nreached port at Bolderaa. I was conscious of a peculiar thrill on\r\ncoming into contact with Russian officials, whom I had instinctively\r\ndetested since the days of my sympathy with the Poles as a boy. It\r\nseemed to me as if the harbour police must read enthusiasm for the\r\nPoles in my face, and would send me to Siberia on the spot, and I was\r\nthe more agreeably surprised, on reaching Riga, to find myself\r\nsurrounded by the familiar German element which, above all, pervaded\r\neverything connected with the theatre.\r\n\r\nAfter my unfortunate experiences in connection with the conditions of\r\nsmall German stages, the way in which this newly opened theatre was run\r\nhad at first a calming effect on my mind. A society had been formed by\r\na number of well-to-do theatre-goers and rich business men to raise, by\r\nvoluntary subscription, sufficient money to provide the sort of\r\nmanagement they regarded as ideal with a solid foundation. The director\r\nthey appointed was Karl von Holtei, a fairly popular dramatic writer,\r\nwho enjoyed a certain reputation in the theatrical world. This man’s\r\nideas about the stage represented a special tendency, which was at that\r\ntime on the decline. He possessed, in addition to his remarkable social\r\ngifts, an extraordinary acquaintance with all the principal people\r\nconnected with the theatre during the past twenty years, and belonged\r\nto a society called Die Liebenswurdigen Libertins (‘The Amiable\r\nLibertines’). This was a set of young would-be wits, who looked upon\r\nthe stage as a playground licensed by the public for the display of\r\ntheir mad pranks, from which the middle class held aloof, while people\r\nof culture were steadily losing all interest in the theatre under these\r\nhopeless conditions.\r\n\r\nHoltei’s wife had in former days been a popular actress at the\r\nKonigstadt theatre in Berlin, and it was here, at the time when\r\nHenriette Sontag raised it to the height of its fame, that Holtei’s\r\nstyle had been formed. The production there of his melodrama Leonore\r\n(founded on Burger’s ballad) had in particular earned him a wide\r\nreputation as a writer for the stage, besides which he produced some\r\nLiederspiele, and among them one, entitled Der Alte Feldherr, became\r\nfairly popular. His invitation to Riga had been particularly welcome,\r\nas it bid fair to gratify his craving to absorb himself completely in\r\nthe life of the stage; he hoped, in this out-of-the-way place, to\r\nindulge his passion without restraint. His peculiar familiarity of\r\nmanner, his inexhaustible store of amusing small talk, and his airy way\r\nof doing business, gave him a remarkable hold on the tradespeople of\r\nRiga, who wished for nothing better than such entertainment as he was\r\nable to give them. They provided him liberally with all the necessary\r\nmeans and treated him in every respect with entire confidence. Under\r\nhis auspices my own engagement had been very easily secured. Surly old\r\npedants he would have none of, favouring young men on the score of\r\ntheir youth alone. As far as I myself was concerned, it was enough for\r\nhim to know that I belonged to a family which he knew and liked, and\r\nhearing, moreover, of my fervent devotion to modern Italian and French\r\nmusic in particular, he decided that I was the very man for him. He had\r\nthe whole shoal of Bellini’s, Donizetti’s, Adam’s, and Auber’s operatic\r\nscores copied out, and I was to give the good people of Riga the\r\nbenefit of them with all possible speed.\r\n\r\nThe first time I visited Holtei I met an old Leipzig acquaintance,\r\nHeinrich Dorn, my former mentor, who now held the permanent municipal\r\nappointment of choir-master at the church and music-teacher in the\r\nschools. He was pleased to find his curious pupil transformed into a\r\npractical opera conductor of independent position, and no less\r\nsurprised to see the eccentric worshipper of Beethoven changed into an\r\nardent champion of Bellini and Adam. He took me home to his summer\r\nresidence, which was built, according to Riga phraseology, ‘in the\r\nfields,’ that is literally, on the sand. While I was giving him some\r\naccount of the experiences through which I had passed, I grew conscious\r\nof the strangely deserted look of the place. Feeling frightened and\r\nhomeless, my initial uneasiness gradually developed into a passionate\r\nlonging to escape from all the whirl of theatrical life which had wooed\r\nme to such inhospitable regions. This uneasy mood was fast dispelling\r\nthe flippancy which at Magdeburg had led to my being dragged down to\r\nthe level of the most worthless stage society, and had also conduced to\r\nspoil my musical taste. It also contained the germs of a new tendency\r\nwhich developed during the period of my activity at Riga, brought me\r\nmore and more out of touch with the theatre, thereby causing Director\r\nHoltei all the annoyance which inevitably attends disappointment.\r\n\r\nFor some time, however, I found no difficulty in making the best of a\r\nbad bargain. We were obliged to open the theatre before the company was\r\ncomplete. To make this possible, we gave a performance of a short comic\r\nopera by C. Blum, called Marie, Max und Michel. For this work I\r\ncomposed an additional air for a song which Holtei had written for the\r\nbass singer, Gunther; it consisted of a sentimental introduction and a\r\ngay military rondo, and was very much appreciated. Later on, I\r\nintroduced another additional song into the Schweizerfamilie, to be\r\nsung by another bass singer, Scheibler; it was of a devotional\r\ncharacter, and pleased not only the public, but myself, and showed\r\nsigns of the upheaval which was gradually taking place in my musical\r\ndevelopment. I was entrusted with the composition of a tune for a\r\nNational Hymn written by Brakel in honour of the Tsar Nicholas’s\r\nbirthday. I tried to give it as far as possible the right colouring for\r\na despotic patriarchal monarch, and once again I achieved some fame,\r\nfor it was sung for several successive years on that particular day.\r\nHoltei tried to persuade me to write a bright, gay comic opera, or\r\nrather a musical play, to be performed by our company just as it stood.\r\nI looked up the libretto of my Glucktiche Barenfamilie, and found\r\nHoltei very well disposed towards it (as I have stated elsewhere); but\r\nwhen I unearthed the little music which I had already composed for it,\r\nI was overcome with disgust at this way of writing; whereupon I made a\r\npresent of the book to my clumsy, good-natured friend, Lobmann, my\r\nright-hand man in the orchestra, and never gave it another thought from\r\nthat day to this. I managed, however, to get to work on the libretto of\r\nRienzi, which I had sketched out at Blasewitz. I developed it from\r\nevery point of view, on so extravagant a scale, that with this work I\r\ndeliberately cut off all possibility of being tempted by circumstances\r\nto produce it anywhere but on one of the largest stages in Europe.\r\n\r\nBut while this helped to strengthen my endeavour to escape from all the\r\npetty degradations of stage life, new complications arose which\r\naffected me more and more seriously, and offered further opposition to\r\nmy aims. The prima donna engaged by Holtei had failed us, and we were\r\ntherefore without a singer for grand opera. Under the circumstances,\r\nHoltei joyfully agreed to my proposal to ask Amalie, Minna’s sister\r\n(who was glad to accept an engagement that brought her near me), to\r\ncome to Riga at once. In her answer to me from Dresden, where she was\r\nthen living, she informed me of Minna’s return to her parents, and of\r\nher present miserable condition owing to a severe illness. I naturally\r\ntook this piece of news very coolly, for what I had heard about Minna\r\nsince she left me for the last time had forced me to authorise my old\r\nfriend at Königsberg to take steps to procure a divorce. It was certain\r\nthat Minna had stayed for some time at a hotel in Hamburg with that\r\nill-omened man, Herr Dietrich, and that she had spread abroad the story\r\nof our separation so unreservedly that the theatrical world in\r\nparticular had discussed it in a manner that was positively insulting\r\nto me. I simply informed Amalie of this, and requested her to spare me\r\nany further news of her sister.\r\n\r\nHereupon Minna herself appealed to me, and wrote me a positively\r\nheartrending letter, in which she openly confessed her infidelity. She\r\ndeclared that she had been driven to it by despair, but that the great\r\ntrouble she had thus brought upon herself having taught her a lesson,\r\nall she now wished was to return to the right path. Taking everything\r\ninto account, I concluded that she had been deceived in the character\r\nof her seducer, and the knowledge of her terrible position had placed\r\nher both morally and physically in a most lamentable condition, in\r\nwhich, now ill and wretched, she turned to me again to acknowledge her\r\nguilt, crave my forgiveness, and assure me, in spite of all, that she\r\nhad now become fully aware of her love for me. Never before had I heard\r\nsuch sentiments from Minna, nor was I ever to hear the same from her\r\nagain, save on one touching occasion many years later, when similar\r\noutpourings moved and affected me in the same way as this particular\r\nletter had done. In reply I told her that there should never again be\r\nany mention between us of what had occurred, for which I took upon\r\nmyself the chief blame; and I can pride myself on having carried out\r\nthis resolution to the letter.\r\n\r\nWhen her sister’s engagement was satisfactorily settled, I at once\r\ninvited Minna to come to Riga with her. Both gladly accepted my\r\ninvitation, and arrived from Dresden at my new home on 19th October,\r\nwintry weather having already set in. With much regret I perceived that\r\nMinna’s health had really suffered, and therefore did all in my power\r\nto provide her with all the domestic comforts and quiet she needed.\r\nThis presented difficulties, for my modest income as a conductor was\r\nall I had at my disposal, and we were both firmly determined not to let\r\nMinna go on the stage again. On the other hand, the carrying out of\r\nthis resolve, in view of the financial inconvenience it entailed,\r\nproduced strange complications, the nature of which was only revealed\r\nto me later, when startling developments divulged the real moral\r\ncharacter of the manager Holtei. For the present I had to let people\r\nthink that I was jealous of my wife. I bore patiently with the general\r\nbelief that I had good reasons to be so, and rejoiced meanwhile at the\r\nrestoration of our peaceful married life, and especially at the sight\r\nof our humble home, which we made as comfortable as our means would\r\nallow, and in the keeping of which Minna’s domestic talents came\r\nstrongly to the fore. As we were still childless, and were obliged as a\r\nrule to enlist the help of a dog in order to give life to the domestic\r\nhearth, we once lighted upon the eccentric idea of trying our luck with\r\na young wolf which was brought into the house as a tiny cub. When we\r\nfound, however, that this experiment did not increase the comfort of\r\nour home life, we gave him up after he had been with us a few weeks. We\r\nfared better with sister Amalie; for she, with her good-nature and\r\nsimple homely ways, did much to make up for the absence of children for\r\na time. The two sisters, neither of whom had had any real education,\r\noften returned playfully to the ways of their childhood. When they sang\r\nchildren’s duets, Minna, though she had had no musical training, always\r\nmanaged very cleverly to sing seconds, and afterwards, as we sat at our\r\nevening meal, eating Russian salad, salt salmon from the Dwina, or\r\nfresh Russian caviare, we were all three very cheerful and happy far\r\naway in our northern home.\r\n\r\nAmalie’s beautiful voice and real vocal talent at first won for her a\r\nvery favourable reception with the public, a fact which did us all a\r\ngreat deal of good. Being, however, very short, and having no very\r\ngreat gift for acting, the scope of her powers was very limited, and as\r\nshe was soon surpassed by more successful competitors, it was a real\r\nstroke of good luck for her that a young officer in the Russian army,\r\nthen Captain, now General, Carl von Meek, fell head over ears in love\r\nwith the simple girl, and married her a year later. The unfortunate\r\npart of this engagement, however, was that it caused many difficulties,\r\nand brought the first cloud over our menage a trois. For, after a\r\nwhile, the two sisters quarrelled bitterly, and I had the very\r\nunpleasant experience of living for a whole year in the same house with\r\ntwo relatives who neither saw nor spoke to each other.\r\n\r\nWe spent the winter at the beginning of 1838 in a very small dingy\r\ndwelling in the old town; it was not till the spring that we moved into\r\na pleasanter house in the more salubrious Petersburg suburb, where, in\r\nspite of the sisterly breach before referred to, we led a fairly bright\r\nand cheerful life, as we were often able to entertain many of our\r\nfriends and acquaintances in a simple though pleasant fashion. In\r\naddition to members of the stage I knew a few people in the town, and\r\nwe received and visited the family of Dorn, the musical director, with\r\nwhom I became quite intimate. But it was the second musical director,\r\nFranz Lobmann, a very worthy though not a very gifted man, who became\r\nmost faithfully attached to me. However, I did not cultivate many\r\nacquaintances in wider circles, and they grew fewer as the ruling\r\npassion of my life grew steadily stronger; so that when, later on, I\r\nleft Riga, after spending nearly two years there, I departed almost as\r\na stranger, and with as much indifference as I had left Magdeburg and\r\nKönigsberg. What, however, specially embittered my departure was a\r\nseries of experiences of a particularly disagreeable nature, which\r\nfirmly determined me to cut myself off entirely from the necessity of\r\nmixing with any people like those I had met with in my previous\r\nattempts to create a position for myself at the theatre.\r\n\r\nYet it was only gradually that I became quite conscious of all this. At\r\nfirst, under the safe guidance of my renewed wedded happiness, which\r\nhad for a time been so disturbed in its early days, I felt distinctly\r\nbetter than I had before in all my professional work. The fact that the\r\nmaterial position of the theatrical undertaking was assured exercised a\r\nhealthy influence on the performances. The theatre itself was cooped up\r\nin a very narrow space; there was as little room for scenic display on\r\nits tiny stage as there was accommodation for rich musical effects in\r\nthe cramped orchestra. In both directions the strictest limits were\r\nimposed, yet I contrived to introduce considerable reinforcements into\r\nan orchestra which was really only calculated for a string quartette,\r\ntwo first and two second violins, two violas, and one ‘cello. These\r\nsuccessful exertions of mine were the first cause of the dislike Holtei\r\nevinced towards me later on. After this we were able to get good\r\nconcerted music for the opera. I found the thorough study of Mehul’s\r\nopera, Joseph in Aegypten, very stimulating. Its noble and simple\r\nstyle, added to the touching effect of the music, which quite carries\r\none away, did much towards effecting a favourable change in my taste,\r\ntill then warped by my connection with the theatre.\r\n\r\nIt was most gratifying to feel my former serious taste again aroused by\r\nreally good dramatic performances. I specially remember a production of\r\nKing Lear, which I followed with the greatest interest, not only at the\r\nactual performances, but at all the rehearsals as well. Yet these\r\neducative impressions tended to make me feel ever more and more\r\ndissatisfied with my work at the theatre. On the one hand, the members\r\nof the company became gradually more distasteful to me, and on the\r\nother I was growing discontented with the management. With regard to\r\nthe staff of the theatre, I very soon found out the hollowness, vanity,\r\nand the impudent selfishness of this uncultured and undisciplined class\r\nof people, for I had now lost my former liking for the Bohemian life\r\nthat had such an attraction for me at Magdeburg. Before long there were\r\nbut a few members of our company with whom I had not quarrelled, thanks\r\nto one or the other of these drawbacks. But my saddest experience was,\r\nthat in such disputes, into which in fact I was led simply by my zeal\r\nfor the artistic success of the performances as a whole, not only did I\r\nreceive no support from Holtei, the director, but I actually made him\r\nmy enemy. He even declared publicly that our theatre had become far too\r\nrespectable for his taste, and tried to convince me that good\r\ntheatrical performances could not be given by a strait-laced company.\r\n\r\nIn his opinion the idea of the dignity of theatrical art was pedantic\r\nnonsense, and he thought light serio-comic vaudeville the only class of\r\nperformance worth considering. Serious opera, rich musical ensemble,\r\nwas his particular aversion, and my demands for this irritated him so\r\nthat he met them only with scorn and indignant refusals. Of the strange\r\nconnection between this artistic bias and his taste in the domain of\r\nmorality I was also to become aware, to my horror, in due course. For\r\nthe present I felt so repelled by the declaration of his artistic\r\nantipathies, as to let my dislike for the theatre as a profession\r\nsteadily grow upon me. I still took pleasure in some good performances\r\nwhich I was able to get up, under favourable circumstances, at the\r\nlarger theatre at Mitau, to where the company went for a time in the\r\nearly part of the summer. Yet it was while I was there, spending most\r\nof my time reading Bulwer Lytton’s novels, that I made a secret resolve\r\nto try hard to free myself from all connection with the only branch of\r\ntheatrical art which had so far been open to me.\r\n\r\nThe composition of my Rienzi, the text of which I had finished in the\r\nearly days of my sojourn in Riga, was destined to bridge me over to the\r\nglorious world for which I had longed so intensely. I had laid aside\r\nthe completion of my Gluckliche Barenfamilie, for the simple reason\r\nthat the lighter character of this piece would have thrown me more into\r\ncontact with the very theatrical people I most despised. My greatest\r\nconsolation now was to prepare Rienzi with such an utter disregard of\r\nthe means which were available there for its production, that my desire\r\nto produce it would force me out of the narrow confines of this puny\r\ntheatrical circle to seek a fresh connection with one of the larger\r\ntheatres. It was after our return from Mitau, in the middle of the\r\nsummer of 1838, that I set to work on this composition, and by so doing\r\nroused myself to a state of enthusiasm which, considering my position,\r\nwas nothing less than desperate dare-devilry. All to whom I confided my\r\nplan perceived at once, on the mere mention of my subject, that I was\r\npreparing to break away from my present position, in which there could\r\nbe no possibility of producing my work, and I was looked upon as\r\nlight-headed and fit only for an asylum.\r\n\r\nTo all my acquaintances my procedure seemed stupid and reckless. Even\r\nthe former patron of my peculiar Leipzig overture thought it\r\nimpracticable and eccentric, seeing that I had again turned my back on\r\nlight opera. He expressed this opinion very freely in the Neue\r\nZeitschrift fur Musik, in a report of a concert I had given towards the\r\nend of the previous winter, and openly ridiculed the Magdeburg Columbus\r\nOverture and the Rule Britannia Overture previously mentioned. I myself\r\nhad not taken any pleasure in the performance of either of these\r\novertures, as my predilection for cornets, strongly marked in both\r\nthese overtures, again played me a sorry trick, as I had evidently\r\nexpected too much of our Riga musicians, and had to endure all kinds of\r\ndisappointment on the occasion of the performance. As a complete\r\ncontrast to my extravagant setting of Rienzi, this same director, H.\r\nDorn, had set to work to write an opera in which he had most carefully\r\nborne in mind the conditions obtaining at the Riga theatre. Der Schoffe\r\nvan Paris, an historical operetta of the period of the siege of Paris\r\nby Joan of Arc, was practised and performed by us to the complete\r\nsatisfaction of the composer. However, the success of this work gave me\r\nno reason for abandoning my project to complete my Rienzi, and I was\r\nsecretly pleased to find that I could regard this success without a\r\ntrace of envy. Though animated by no feeling of rivalry, I gradually\r\ngave up associating with the Riga artists, confining myself chiefly to\r\nthe performance of the duties I had undertaken, and worked away at the\r\ntwo first acts of my big opera without troubling myself at all whether\r\nI should ever get so far as to see it produced.\r\n\r\nThe serious and bitter experiences I had had so early in life had done\r\nmuch to guide me towards that intensely earnest side of my nature that\r\nhad manifested itself in my earliest youth. The effect of these bitter\r\nexperiences was now to be still further emphasised by other sad\r\nimpressions. Not long after Minna had rejoined me, I received from home\r\nthe news of the death of my sister Rosalie. It was the first time in my\r\nlife that I had experienced the passing away of one near and dear to\r\nme. The death of this sister struck me as a most cruel and significant\r\nblow of fate; it was out of love and respect for her that I had turned\r\naway so resolutely from my youthful excesses, and it was to gain her\r\nsympathy that I had devoted special thought and care to my first great\r\nworks. When the passions and cares of life had come upon me and driven\r\nme away from my home, it was she who had read deep down into my sorely\r\nstricken heart, and who had bidden me that anxious farewell on my\r\ndeparture from Leipzig. At the time of my disappearance, when the news\r\nof my wilful marriage and of my consequent unfortunate position reached\r\nmy family, it was she who, as my mother informed me later, never lost\r\nher faith in me, but who always cherished the hope that I would one day\r\nreach the full development of my capabilities and make a genuine\r\nsuccess of my life.\r\n\r\nNow, at the news of her death, and illuminated by the recollection of\r\nthat one impressive farewell, as by a flash of lightning I saw the\r\nimmense value my relations with this sister had been to me, and I did\r\nnot fully realise the extent of her influence until later on, when,\r\nafter my first striking successes, my mother tearfully lamented that\r\nRosalie had not lived to witness them. It really did me good to be\r\nagain in communication with my family. My mother and sisters had had\r\nnews of my doings somehow or other, and I was deeply touched, in the\r\nletters which I was now receiving from them, to hear no reproaches\r\nanent my headstrong and apparently heartless behaviour, but only\r\nsympathy and heartfelt solicitude. My family had also received\r\nfavourable reports about my wife’s good qualities, a fact about which I\r\nwas particularly glad, as I was thus spared the difficulties of\r\ndefending her questionable behaviour to me, which I should have been at\r\npains to excuse. This produced a salutary calm in my soul, which had so\r\nrecently been a prey to the worst anxieties. All that had driven me\r\nwith such passionate haste to an improvident and premature marriage,\r\nall that had consequently weighed on me so ruinously, now seemed set at\r\nrest, leaving peace in its stead. And although the ordinary cares of\r\nlife still pressed on me for many years, often in a most vexatious and\r\ntroublesome form, yet the anxieties attendant on my ardent youthful\r\nwishes were in a manner subdued and calm. From thence forward till the\r\nattainment of my professional independence, all my life’s struggles\r\ncould be directed entirely towards that more ideal aim which, from the\r\ntime of the conception of my Rienzi, was to be my only guide through\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt was only later that I first realised the real character of my life\r\nin Riga, from the utterance of one of its inhabitants, who was\r\nastonished to learn of the success of a man of whose importance, during\r\nthe whole of his two years’ sojourn in the small capital of Livonia,\r\nnothing had been known. Thrown entirely on my own resources, I was a\r\nstranger to every one. As I mentioned before, I kept aloof from all the\r\ntheatre folk, in consequence of my increasing dislike of them, and\r\ntherefore, when at the end of March, 1839, at the close of my second\r\nwinter there, I was given my dismissal by the management, although this\r\noccurrence surprised me for other reasons, yet I felt fully reconciled\r\nto this compulsory change in my life. The reasons which led to this\r\ndismissal were, however, of such a nature that I could only regard it\r\nas one of the most disagreeable experiences of my life. Once, when I\r\nwas lying dangerously ill, I heard of Holtei’s real feelings towards\r\nme. I had caught a severe cold in the depth of winter at a theatrical\r\nrehearsal, and it at once assumed a serious character, owing to the\r\nfact that my nerves were in a state of constant irritation from the\r\ncontinual annoyance and vexatious worry caused by the contemptible\r\ncharacter of the theatrical management. It was just at the time when a\r\nspecial performance of the opera Norma was to be given by our company\r\nin Mitau. Holtei insisted on my getting up from a sick-bed to make this\r\nwintry journey, and thus to expose myself to the danger of seriously\r\nincreasing my cold in the icy theatre at Mitau. Typhoid fever was the\r\nconsequence, and this pulled me down to such an extent that Holtei, who\r\nheard of my condition, is said to have remarked at the theatre that I\r\nshould probably never conduct again, and that, to all intents and\r\npurposes, ‘I was on my last legs.’ It was to a splendid homoeopathic\r\nphysician, Dr. Prutzer, that I owed my recovery and my life. Not long\r\nafter that Holtei left our theatre and Riga for ever; his occupation\r\nthere, with ‘the far too respectable conditions,’ as he expressed it,\r\nhad become intolerable to him. In addition, however, circumstances had\r\narisen in his domestic life (which had been much affected by the death\r\nof his wife) which seemed to make him consider a complete break with\r\nRiga eminently desirable. But to my astonishment I now first became\r\naware that I too had unconsciously been a sufferer from the troubles he\r\nhad brought upon himself. When Holtei’s successor in the\r\nmanagement—Joseph Hoffmann the singer—informed me that his predecessor\r\nhad made it a condition to his taking over the post that he should\r\nenter into the same engagement that Holtei had made with the conductor\r\nDorn for the post which I had hitherto filled, and my reappointment had\r\ntherefore been made an impossibility, my wife met my astonishment at\r\nthis news by giving me the reason, of which for some considerable time\r\npast she had been well aware, namely, Holtei’s special dislike of us\r\nboth. When I was afterwards informed by Minna of what had happened—she\r\nhaving purposely kept it from me all this time, so as not to cause bad\r\nfeeling between me and my director—a ghastly light was thrown upon the\r\nwhole affair. I did indeed remember perfectly how, soon after Minna’s\r\narrival in Riga, I had been particularly pressed by Holtei not to\r\nprevent my wife’s engagement at the theatre. I asked him to talk things\r\nquietly over with her, so that he might see that Minna’s unwillingness\r\nrested on a mutual understanding, and not on any jealousy on my part. I\r\nhad intentionally given him the time when I was engaged at the theatre\r\non rehearsals for the necessary discussions with my wife. At the end of\r\nthese meetings I had, on my return, often found Minna in a very excited\r\ncondition, and at length she declared emphatically that under no\r\ncircumstances would she accept the engagement offered by Holtei. I had\r\nalso noticed in Minna’s demeanour towards me a strange anxiety to know\r\nwhy I was not unwilling to allow Holtei to try to persuade her. Now\r\nthat the catastrophe had occurred, I learned that Holtei had in fact\r\nused these interviews for making improper advances to my wife, the\r\nnature of which I only realised with difficulty on further acquaintance\r\nwith this man’s peculiarities, and after having heard of other\r\ninstances of a similar nature. I then discovered that Holtei considered\r\nit an advantage to get himself talked about in connection with pretty\r\nwomen, in order thus to divert the attention of the public from other\r\nconduct even more disreputable. After this Minna was exceedingly\r\nindignant at Holtei, who, finding his own suit rejected, appeared as\r\nthe medium for another suitor, on whose behalf he urged that he would\r\nthink none the worse of her for rejecting him, a grey-haired and\r\npenniless man, but at the same time advocated the suit of Brandenburg,\r\na very wealthy and handsome young merchant. His fierce indignation at\r\nthis double repulse, his humiliation at having revealed his real nature\r\nto no purpose, seems, to judge from Minna’s observations, to have been\r\nexceedingly great. I now understood too well that his frequent and\r\nprofoundly contemptuous sallies against respectable actors and\r\nactresses had not been mere spirited exaggerations, but that he had\r\nprobably often had to complain of being put thoroughly to shame on this\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the playing of such criminal parts as the one he had had\r\nin view with my wife was unable to divert the ever-increasing attention\r\nof the outside world from his vicious and dissolute habits, does not\r\nseem to have escaped him; for those behind the scenes told me candidly\r\nthat it was owing to the fear of very unpleasant revelations that he\r\nhad suddenly decided to give up his position at Riga altogether. Even\r\nin much later years I heard about Holtei’s bitter dislike of me, a\r\ndislike which showed itself, among other things, in his denunciation of\r\nThe Music of the Future,[8]  and of its tendency to jeopardise the\r\nsimplicity of pure sentiment. I have previously mentioned that he\r\ndisplayed so much personal animosity against me during the latter part\r\nof the time we were together in Riga that he vented his hostility upon\r\nme in every possible way. Up to that time I had felt inclined to\r\nascribe it to the divergence of our respective views on artistic\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n [8] _Zukunftsmusik_ is a pamphlet revealing some of Wagner’s artistic\r\n aims and aspirations, written 1860-61.—EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo my dismay I now became aware that personal considerations alone were\r\nat the bottom of all this, and I blushed to realise that by my former\r\nunreserved confidence in a man whom I thought was absolutely honest, I\r\nhad based my knowledge of human nature on such very weak foundations.\r\nBut still greater was my disappointment when I discovered the real\r\ncharacter of my friend H. Dorn. During the whole time of our\r\nintercourse at Riga, he, who formerly treated me more like a\r\ngood-natured elder brother, had become my most confidential friend. We\r\nsaw and visited each other almost daily, very frequently in our\r\nrespective homes. I kept not a single secret from him, and the\r\nperformance of his Schoffe van Paris under my direction was as\r\nsuccessful as if it had been under his own. Now, when I heard that my\r\npost had been given to him, I felt obliged to ask him about it, in\r\norder to learn whether there was any mistake on his part as to my\r\nintention regarding the position I had hitherto held. But from his\r\nletter in reply I could clearly see that Dorn had really made use of\r\nHoltei’s dislike for me to extract from him, before his departure, an\r\narrangement which was both binding on his successor and also in his\r\n(Dorn’s) own favour. As my friend he ought to have known that he could\r\nbenefit by this agreement only in the event of my resigning my\r\nappointment in Riga, because in our confidential conversations, which\r\ncontinued to the end, he always carefully refrained from touching on\r\nthe possibility of my going away or remaining. In fact, he declared\r\nthat Holtei had distinctly told him he would on no account re-engage\r\nme, as I could not get on with the singers. He added that after this\r\none could not take it amiss if he, who had been inspired with fresh\r\nenthusiasm for the theatre by the success of his Schoffe von Paris, had\r\nseized and turned to his own advantage the chance offered to him.\r\nMoreover, he had gathered from my confidential communications that I\r\nwas very awkwardly situated, and that, owing to my small salary having\r\nbeen cut down by Holtei from the very beginning, I was in a very\r\nprecarious position on account of the demands of my creditors in\r\nKönigsberg and Magdeburg. It appeared that these people had employed\r\nagainst me a lawyer, who was a friend of Dorn’s, and that,\r\nconsequently, he had come to the conclusion that I would not be able to\r\nremain in Riga. Therefore, even as my friend, he had felt his\r\nconscience quite clear in accepting Holtei’s proposal.\r\n\r\nIn order not to leave him in the complacent enjoyment of this\r\nself-deception, I put it clearly before him that he could not be\r\nignorant of the fact that a higher salary had been promised to me for\r\nthe third year of my contract; and that, by the establishment of\r\norchestral concerts, which had already made a favourable start, I now\r\nsaw my way to getting free from those long-standing debts, having\r\nalready overcome the difficulties of the removal and settling down. I\r\nalso asked him how he would act if I saw it was to my own interest to\r\nretain my post, and to call on him to resign his agreement with Holtei,\r\nwho, as a matter of fact, after his departure from Riga, had withdrawn\r\nhis alleged reason for my dismissal. To this I received no answer, nor\r\nhave I had one up to the present day; but, on the other hand, in 1865,\r\nI was astonished to see Dorn enter my house in Munich unannounced, and\r\nwhen to his joy I recognised him, he stepped up to me with a gesture\r\nwhich clearly showed his intention of embracing me. Although I managed\r\nto evade this, yet I soon saw the difficulty of preventing him from\r\naddressing me with the familiar form of ‘thou,’ as the attempt to do so\r\nwould have necessitated explanations that would have been a useless\r\naddition to all my worries just then; for it was the time when my\r\nTristan was being produced.\r\n\r\nSuch a man was Heinrich Dorn. Although, after the failure of three\r\noperas, he had retired in disgust from the theatre to devote himself\r\nexclusively to the commercial side of music, yet the success of his\r\nopera, Der Schoffe von Paris, in Riga helped him back to a permanent\r\nplace among the dramatic musicians of Germany. But to this position he\r\nwas first dragged from obscurity, across the bridge of infidelity to\r\nhis friend, and by the aid of virtue in the person of Director Holtei,\r\nthanks to a magnanimous oversight on the part of Franz Listz. The\r\npreference of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. for church scenes contributed\r\nto secure him eventually his important position at the greatest lyric\r\ntheatre in Germany, the Royal Opera of Berlin. For he was prompted far\r\nless by his devotion to the dramatic muse than by his desire to secure\r\na good position in some important German city, when, as already hinted,\r\nthrough Liszt’s recommendation he was appointed musical director of\r\nCologne Cathedral. During a fete connected with the building of the\r\ncathedral he managed, as a musician, so to work upon the Prussian\r\nmonarch’s religious feelings, that he was appointed to the dignified\r\npost of musical conductor at the Royal Theatre, in which capacity he\r\nlong continued to do honour to German dramatic music in conjunction\r\nwith Wilhelm Taubert.\r\n\r\nI must give J. Hoffmann, who from this time forward was the manager of\r\nthe Riga theatre, the credit of having felt the treachery practised\r\nupon me very deeply indeed. He told me that his contract with Dorn\r\nbound him only for one year, and that the moment the twelve months had\r\nelapsed he wished to come to a fresh agreement with me. As soon as this\r\nwas known, my patrons in Riga came forward with offers of teaching\r\nengagements and arrangements for sundry concerts, by way of\r\ncompensating me for the year’s salary which I should lose by being away\r\nfrom my work as a conductor. Though I was much gratified by these\r\noffers, yet, as I have already pointed out, the longing to break loose\r\nfrom the kind of theatrical life which I had experienced up to that\r\ntime so possessed me that I resolutely seized this chance of abandoning\r\nmy former vocation for an entirely new one. Not without some\r\nshrewdness, I played upon my wife’s indignation at the treachery I had\r\nsuffered, in order to make her fall in with my eccentric notion of\r\ngoing to Paris. Already in my conception of Rienzi I had dreamed of the\r\nmost magnificent theatrical conditions, but now, without halting at any\r\nintermediate stations, my one desire was to reach the very heart of all\r\nEuropean grand opera. While still in Magdeburg I had made H. Konig’s\r\nromance, Die Hohe Braut, the subject of a grand opera in five acts, and\r\nin the most luxurious French style. After the scenic draft of this\r\nopera, which had been translated into French, was completely worked\r\nout, I sent it from Königsberg to Scribe in Paris. With this manuscript\r\nI sent a letter to the famous operatic poet, in which I suggested that\r\nhe might make use of my plot, on condition that he would secure me the\r\ncomposition of the music for the Paris Opera House. To convince him of\r\nmy ability to compose Parisian operatic music, I also sent him the\r\nscore of my Liebesverbot. At the same time I wrote to Meyerbeer,\r\ninforming him of my plans, and begging him to support me. I was not at\r\nall disheartened at receiving no reply, for I was content to know that\r\nnow at last ‘I was in communication with Paris.’ When, therefore, I\r\nstarted out upon my daring journey from Riga, I seemed to have a\r\ncomparatively serious object in view, and my Paris projects no longer\r\nstruck me as being altogether in the air. In addition to this I now\r\nheard that my youngest sister, Cecilia, had become betrothed to a\r\ncertain Eduard Avenarius, an employee of the Brockhaus book-selling\r\nfirm, and that he had undertaken the management of their Paris branch.\r\nTo him I applied for news of Scribe, and for an answer to the\r\napplication I had made to that gentleman some years previously.\r\nAvenarius called on Scribe, and from him received an acknowledgment of\r\nthe receipt of my earlier communication. Scribe also showed that he had\r\nsome recollection of the subject itself; for he said that, so far as he\r\ncould remember, there was a joueuse de harpe in the piece, who was\r\nill-treated by her brother. The fact that this merely incidental item\r\nhad alone remained in his memory led me to conclude that he had not\r\nextended his acquaintance with the piece beyond the first act, in which\r\nthe item in question occurs. When, moreover, I heard that he had\r\nnothing to say in regard to my score, except that he had had portions\r\nof it played over to him by a pupil of the Conservatoire, I really\r\ncould not flatter myself that he had entered into definite and\r\nconscious relations with me. And yet I had palpable evidence in a\r\nletter of his to Avenarius, which the latter forwarded to me, that\r\nScribe had actually occupied himself with my work, and that I was\r\nindeed in communication with him, and this letter of Scribe’s made such\r\nan impression upon my wife, who was by no means inclined to be\r\nsanguine, that she gradually overcame her apprehensions in regard to\r\nthe Paris adventure. At last it was fixed and settled that on the\r\nexpiry of my second year’s contract in Riga (that is to say, in the\r\ncoming summer, 1839), we should journey direct from Riga to Paris, in\r\norder that I might try my luck there as a composer of opera.\r\n\r\nThe production of my Rienzi now began to assume greater importance. The\r\ncomposition of its second act was finished before we started, and into\r\nthis I wove a heroic ballet of extravagant dimensions. It was now\r\nimperative that I should speedily acquire a knowledge of French, a\r\nlanguage which, during my classical studies at the Grammar School, I\r\nhad contemptuously laid aside. As there were only four weeks in which\r\nto recover the time I had lost, I engaged an excellent French master.\r\nBut as I soon realised that I could achieve but little in so short a\r\ntime, I utilised the hours of the lessons in order to obtain from him,\r\nunder the pretence of receiving instruction, an idiomatic translation\r\nof my Rienzi libretto. This I wrote with red ink on such parts of the\r\nscore as were finished, so that on reaching Paris I might immediately\r\nsubmit my half-finished opera to French judges of art.\r\n\r\nEverything now seemed to be carefully prepared for my departure, and\r\nall that remained to be done was to raise the necessary funds for my\r\nundertaking. But in this respect the outlook was bad. The sale of our\r\nmodest household furniture, the proceeds of a benefit concert, and my\r\nmeagre savings only sufficed to satisfy the importunate demands of my\r\ncreditors in Magdeburg and Königsberg. I knew that if I were to devote\r\nall my cash to this purpose, there would not be a farthing left. Some\r\nway out of the fix must be found, and this our old Königsberg friend,\r\nAbraham Möller, suggested in his usual flippant and obscure manner.\r\nJust at this critical moment he paid us a second visit to Riga. I\r\nacquainted him with the difficulties of our position, and all the\r\nobstacles which stood in the way of my resolve to go to Paris. In his\r\nhabitual laconical way he counselled me to reserve all my savings for\r\nour journey, and to settle with my creditors when my Parisian successes\r\nhad provided the necessary means. To help us in carrying out this plan,\r\nhe offered to convey us in his carriage across the Russian frontier at\r\ntop speed to an East Prussian port. We should have to cross the Russian\r\nfrontier without passports, as these had been already impounded by our\r\nforeign creditors. He assured us that we should find it quite simple to\r\ncarry out this very hazardous expedition, and declared that he had a\r\nfriend on a Prussian estate close to the frontier who would render us\r\nvery effective assistance. My eagerness to escape at any price from my\r\nprevious circumstances, and to enter with all possible speed upon the\r\nwider field, in which I hoped very soon to realise my ambition, blinded\r\nme to all the unpleasantnesses which the execution of his proposal must\r\nentail. Director Hoffmann, who considered himself bound to serve me to\r\nthe utmost of his ability, facilitated my departure by allowing me to\r\nleave some months before the expiration of my engagement. After\r\ncontinuing to conduct the operatic portion of the Mitau theatrical\r\nseason through the month of June, we secretly started in a special\r\ncoach hired by Möller and under his protection. The goal of our journey\r\nwas Paris, but many unheard-of hardships were in store for us before we\r\nwere to reach that city.\r\n\r\nThe sense of contentment involuntarily aroused by our passage through\r\nthe fruitful Courland in the luxuriant month of July, and by the sweet\r\nillusion that now at last I had cut myself loose from a hateful\r\nexistence, to enter upon a new and boundless path of fortune, was\r\ndisturbed from its very outset by the miserable inconveniences\r\noccasioned by the presence of a huge Newfoundland dog called Robber.\r\nThis beautiful creature, originally the property of a Riga merchant,\r\nhad, contrary to the nature of his race, become devotedly attached to\r\nme. After I had left Riga, and during my long stay in Mitau, Robber\r\nincessantly besieged my empty house, and so touched the hearts of my\r\nlandlord and the neighbours by his fidelity, that they sent the dog\r\nafter me by the conductor of the coach to Mitau, where I greeted him\r\nwith genuine effusion, and swore that, in spite of all difficulties, I\r\nwould never part with him again. Whatever might happen, the dog must go\r\nwith us to Paris. And yet, even to get him into the carriage proved\r\nalmost impossible. All my endeavours to find him a place in or about\r\nthe vehicle were in vain, and, to my great grief, I had to watch the\r\nhuge northern beast, with his shaggy coat, gallop all day long in the\r\nblazing sun beside the carriage. At last, moved to pity by his\r\nexhaustion, and unable to bear the sight any longer, I hit upon a most\r\ningenious plan for bringing the great animal with us into the carriage,\r\nwhere, in spite of its being full to overflowing, he was just able to\r\nfind room.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the second day we reached the Russo-Prussian\r\nfrontier. Möller’s evident anxiety as to whether we should be able to\r\ncross it safely showed us plainly that the matter was one of some\r\ndanger. His good friend from the other side duly turned up with a small\r\ncarriage, as arranged, and in this conveyance drove Minna, myself, and\r\nRobber through by paths to a certain point, whence he led us on foot to\r\na house of exceedingly suspicious exterior, where, after handing us\r\nover to a guide, he left us. There we had to wait until sundown, and\r\nhad ample leisure in which to realise that we were in a smugglers’\r\ndrinking den, which gradually became filled to suffocation with Polish\r\nJews of most forbidding aspect.\r\n\r\nAt last we were summoned to follow our guide. A few hundred feet away,\r\non the slope of a hill, lay the ditch which runs the whole length of\r\nthe Russian frontier, watched continually and at very narrow intervals\r\nby Cossacks. Our chance was to utilise the few moments after the relief\r\nof the watch, during which the sentinels were elsewhere engaged. We\r\nhad, therefore, to run at full speed down the hill, scramble through\r\nthe ditch, and then hurry along until we were beyond the range of the\r\nsoldiers’ guns; for the Cossacks were bound in case of discovery to\r\nfire upon us even on the other side of the ditch. In spite of my almost\r\npassionate anxiety for Minna, I had observed with singular pleasure the\r\nintelligent behaviour of Robber, who, as though conscious of the\r\ndanger, silently kept close to our side, and entirely dispelled my fear\r\nthat he would give trouble during our dangerous passage. At last our\r\ntrusted helpmeet reappeared, and was so delighted that he hugged us all\r\nin his arms. Then, placing us once more in his carriage, he drove us to\r\nthe inn of the Prussian frontier village, where my friend Möller,\r\npositively sick with anxiety, leaped sobbing and rejoicing out of bed\r\nto greet us.\r\n\r\nIt was only now that I began to realise the danger to which I had\r\nexposed, not only myself, but also my poor Minna, and the folly of\r\nwhich I had been guilty through my ignorance of the terrible\r\ndifficulties of secretly crossing the frontier—difficulties concerning\r\nwhich Möller had foolishly allowed me to remain in ignorance.\r\n\r\nI was simply at a loss to convey to my poor exhausted wife how\r\nextremely I regretted the whole affair.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the difficulties we had just overcome were but the prelude to\r\nthe calamities incidental to this adventurous journey which had such a\r\ndecisive influence on my life. The following day, when, with courage\r\nrenewed, we drove through the rich plain of Tilsit to Arnau, near\r\nKönigsberg, we decided, as the next stage of our journey, to proceed\r\nfrom the Prussian harbour of Pillau by sailing vessel to London. Our\r\nprincipal reason for this was the consideration of the dog we had with\r\nus. It was the easiest way to take him. To convey him by coach from\r\nKönigsberg to Paris was out of the question, and railways were unknown.\r\nBut another consideration was our budget; the whole result of my\r\ndesperate efforts amounted to not quite one hundred ducats, which were\r\nto cover not only the journey to Paris, but our expenses there until I\r\nshould have earned something. Therefore, after a few days’ rest in the\r\ninn at Arnau, we drove to the little seaport town of Pillau, again\r\naccompanied by Möller, in one of the ordinary local conveyances, which\r\nwas not much better than a wagon. In order to avoid Königsberg, we\r\npassed through the smaller villages and over bad roads. Even this short\r\ndistance was not to be covered without accident. The clumsy conveyance\r\nupset in a farmyard, and Minna was so severely indisposed by the\r\naccident, owing to an internal shock, that I had to drag her—with the\r\ngreatest difficulty, as she was quite helpless—to a peasant’s house.\r\nThe people were surly and dirty, and the night we spent there was a\r\npainful one for the poor sufferer. A delay of several days occurred\r\nbefore the departure of the Pillau vessel, but this was welcome as a\r\nrespite to allow of Minna’s recovery. Finally, as the captain was to\r\ntake us without a passport, our going on board was accompanied by\r\nexceptional difficulties. We had to contrive to slip past the harbour\r\nwatch to our vessel in a small boat before daybreak. Once on board, we\r\nstill had the troublesome task of hauling Robber up the steep side of\r\nthe vessel without attracting attention, and after that to conceal\r\nourselves at once below deck, in order to escape the notice of\r\nofficials visiting the ship before its departure. The anchor was\r\nweighed, and at last, as the land faded gradually out of sight, we\r\nthought we could breathe freely and feel at ease.\r\n\r\nWe were on board a merchant vessel of the smallest type. She was called\r\nthe Thetis; a bust of the nymph was erected in the bows, and she\r\ncarried a crew of seven men, including the captain. With good weather,\r\nsuch as was to be expected in summer, the journey to London was\r\nestimated to take eight days. However, before we had left the Baltic,\r\nwe were delayed by a prolonged calm. I made use of the time to improve\r\nmy knowledge of French by the study of a novel, La Derniere Aldini, by\r\nGeorge Sand. We also derived some entertainment from associating with\r\nthe crew. There was an elderly and peculiarly taciturn sailor named\r\nKoske, whom we observed carefully because Robber, who was usually so\r\nfriendly, had taken an irreconcilable dislike to him. Oddly enough,\r\nthis fact was to add in some degree to our troubles in the hour of\r\ndanger. After seven days’ sailing we were no further than Copenhagen,\r\nwhere, without leaving the vessel, we seized an opportunity of making\r\nour very spare diet on board more bearable by various purchases of food\r\nand drink. In good spirits we sailed past the beautiful castle of\r\nElsinore, the sight of which brought me into immediate touch with my\r\nyouthful impressions of Hamlet. We were sailing all unsuspecting\r\nthrough the Cattegat to the Skagerack, when the wind, which had at\r\nfirst been merely unfavourable, and had forced us to a process of weary\r\ntacking, changed on the second day to a violent storm. For twenty-four\r\nhours we had to struggle against it under disadvantages which were\r\nquite new to us. In the captain’s painfully narrow cabin, in which one\r\nof us was without a proper berth, we were a prey to sea-sickness and\r\nendless alarms. Unfortunately, the brandy cask, at which the crew\r\nfortified themselves during their strenuous work, was let into a hollow\r\nunder the seat on which I lay at full length. Now it happened to be\r\nKoske who came most frequently in search of the refreshment which was\r\nsuch a nuisance to me, and this in spite of the fact that on each\r\noccasion he had to encounter Robber in mortal combat. The dog flew at\r\nhim with renewed rage each time he came climbing down the narrow steps.\r\nI was thus compelled to make efforts which, in my state of complete\r\nexhaustion from sea-sickness, rendered my condition every time more\r\ncritical. At last, on 27th July, the captain was compelled by the\r\nviolence of the west wind to seek a harbour on the Norwegian coast. And\r\nhow relieved I was to behold that far-reaching rocky coast, towards\r\nwhich we were being driven at such speed! A Norwegian pilot came to\r\nmeet us in a small boat, and, with experienced hand, assumed control of\r\nthe Thetis, whereupon in a very short time I was to have one of the\r\nmost marvellous and most beautiful impressions of my life. What I had\r\ntaken to be a continuous line of cliffs turned out on our approach to\r\nbe a series of separate rocks projecting from the sea. Having sailed\r\npast them, we perceived that we were surrounded, not only in front and\r\nat the sides, but also at our back, by these reefs, which closed in\r\nbehind us so near together that they seemed to form a single chain of\r\nrocks. At the same time the hurricane was so broken by the rocks in our\r\nrear that the further we sailed through this ever-changing labyrinth of\r\nprojecting rocks, the calmer the sea became, until at last the vessel’s\r\nprogress was perfectly smooth and quiet as we entered one of those long\r\nsea-roads running through a giant ravine—for such the Norwegian fjords\r\nappeared to me.\r\n\r\nA feeling of indescribable content came over me when the enormous\r\ngranite walls echoed the hail of the crew as they cast anchor and\r\nfurled the sails. The sharp rhythm of this call clung to me like an\r\nomen of good cheer, and shaped itself presently into the theme of the\r\nseamen’s song in my Fliegender Holländer. The idea of this opera was,\r\neven at that time, ever present in my mind, and it now took on a\r\ndefinite poetic and musical colour under the influence of my recent\r\nimpressions. Well, our next move was to go on shore. I learned that the\r\nlittle fishing village at which we landed was called Sandwike, and was\r\nsituated a few miles away from the much larger town of Arendal. We were\r\nallowed to put up at the hospitable house of a certain ship’s captain,\r\nwho was then away at sea, and here we were able to take the rest we so\r\nmuch needed, as the unabated violence of the wind in the open detained\r\nus there two days. On 31st July the captain insisted on leaving,\r\ndespite the pilot’s warning. We had been on board the Thetis a few\r\nhours, and were in the act of eating a lobster for the first time in\r\nour lives, when the captain and the sailors began to swear violently at\r\nthe pilot, whom I could see at the helm, rigid with fear, striving to\r\navoid a reef—barely visible above the water—towards which our ship was\r\nbeing driven. Great was our terror at this violent tumult, for we\r\nnaturally thought ourselves in the most extreme danger. The vessel did\r\nactually receive a severe shock, which, to my vivid imagination, seemed\r\nlike the splitting up of the whole ship. Fortunately, however, it\r\ntranspired that only the side of our vessel had fouled the reef, and\r\nthere was no immediate danger. Nevertheless, the captain deemed it\r\nnecessary to steer for a harbour to have the vessel examined, and we\r\nreturned to the coast and anchored at another point. The captain then\r\noffered to take us in a small boat with two sailors to Tromsond, a town\r\nof some importance situated at a few hours’ distance, where he had to\r\ninvite the harbour officials to examine his ship. This again proved a\r\nmost attractive and impressive excursion. The view of one fjord in\r\nparticular, which extended far inland, worked on my imagination like\r\nsome unknown, awe-inspiring desert. This impression was intensified,\r\nduring a long walk from Tromsond up to the plateau, by the terribly\r\ndepressing effect of the dun moors, bare of tree or shrub, boasting\r\nonly a covering of scanty moss, which stretch away to the horizon, and\r\nmerge imperceptibly into the gloomy sky. It was long after dark when we\r\nreturned from this trip in our little boat, and my wife was very\r\nanxious. The next morning (1st August), reassured as to the condition\r\nof the vessel, and the wind favouring us, we were able to go to sea\r\nwithout further hindrance.\r\n\r\nAfter four days’ calm sailing a strong north wind arose, which drove us\r\nat uncommon speed in the right direction. We began to think ourselves\r\nnearly at the end of our journey when, on 6th August, the wind changed,\r\nand the storm began to rage with unheard-of violence. On the 7th, a\r\nWednesday, at half-past two in the afternoon, we thought ourselves in\r\nimminent danger of death. It was not the terrible force with which the\r\nvessel was hurled up and down, entirely at the mercy of this sea\r\nmonster, which appeared now as a fathomless abyss, now as a steep\r\nmountain peak, that filled me with mortal dread; my premonition of some\r\nterrible crisis was aroused by the despondency of the crew, whose\r\nmalignant glances seemed superstitiously to point to us as the cause of\r\nthe threatening disaster. Ignorant of the trifling occasion for the\r\nsecrecy of our journey, the thought may have occurred to them that our\r\nneed of escape had arisen from suspicious or even criminal\r\ncircumstances. The captain himself seemed, in his extreme distress, to\r\nregret having taken us on board; for we had evidently brought him\r\nill-luck on this familiar passage—usually a rapid and uncomplicated\r\none, especially in summer. At this particular moment there raged,\r\nbeside the tempest on the water, a furious thunderstorm overhead, and\r\nMinna expressed the fervent wish to be struck by lightning with me\r\nrather than to sink, living, into the fearful flood. She even begged me\r\nto bind her to me, so that we might not be parted as we sank. Yet\r\nanother night was spent amid these incessant terrors, which only our\r\nextreme exhaustion helped to mitigate.\r\n\r\nThe following day the storm had subsided; the wind remained\r\nunfavourable, but was mild. The captain now tried to find our bearings\r\nby means of his astronomical instruments. He complained of the sky,\r\nwhich had been overcast so many days, swore that he would give much for\r\na single glimpse of the sun or the stars, and did not conceal the\r\nuneasiness he felt at not being able to indicate our whereabouts with\r\ncertainty. He consoled himself, however, by following a ship which was\r\nsailing some knots ahead in the same direction, and whose movements he\r\nobserved closely through the telescope. Suddenly he sprang up in great\r\nalarm, and gave a vehement order to change our course. He had seen the\r\nship in front go aground on a sand-bank, from which, he asserted, she\r\ncould not extricate herself; for he now realised that we were near the\r\nmost dangerous part of the belt of sand-banks bordering the Dutch coast\r\nfor a considerable distance. By dint of very skilful sailing, we were\r\nenabled to keep the opposite course towards the English coast, which we\r\nin fact sighted on the evening of 9th August, in the neighbourhood of\r\nSouthwold. I felt new life come into me when I saw in the far distance\r\nthe English pilots racing for our ship. As competition is free among\r\npilots on the English coast, they come out as far as possible to meet\r\nincoming vessels, even when the risks are very great.\r\n\r\nThe winner in our case was a powerful grey-haired man, who, after much\r\nvain battling with the seething waves, which tossed his light boat away\r\nfrom our ship at each attempt, at last succeeded in boarding the\r\nThetis. (Our poor, hardly-used boat still bore the name, although the\r\nwooden figure-head of our patron nymph had been hurled into the sea\r\nduring our first storm in the Cattegat—an ill-omened incident in the\r\neyes of the crew.) We were filled with pious gratitude when this quiet\r\nEnglish sailor, whose hands were torn and bleeding from his repeated\r\nefforts to catch the rope thrown to him on his approach, took over the\r\nrudder. His whole personality impressed us most agreeably, and he\r\nseemed to us the absolute guarantee of a speedy deliverance from our\r\nterrible afflictions. We rejoiced too soon, however, for we still had\r\nbefore us the perilous passage through the sand-banks off the English\r\ncoast, where, as I was assured, nearly four hundred ships are wrecked\r\non an average every year. We were fully twenty-four hours (from the\r\nevening of the 10th to the 11th of August) amid these sandbanks,\r\nfighting a westerly gale, which hindered our progress so seriously that\r\nwe only reached the mouth of the Thames on the evening of the 12th of\r\nAugust. My wife had, up to that point, been so nervously affected by\r\nthe innumerable danger signals, consisting chiefly of small guardships\r\npainted bright red and provided with bells on account of the fog, that\r\nshe could not close her eyes, day or night, for the excitement of\r\nwatching for them and pointing them out to the sailors. I, on the\r\ncontrary, found these heralds of human proximity and deliverance so\r\nconsoling that, despite Minna’s reproaches, I indulged in a long\r\nrefreshing sleep. Now that we were anchored in the mouth of the Thames,\r\nwaiting for daybreak, I found myself in the best of spirits; I dressed,\r\nwashed, and even shaved myself up on deck near the mast, while Minna\r\nand the whole exhausted crew were wrapped in deep slumber. And with\r\ndeepening interest I watched the growing signs of life in this famous\r\nestuary. Our desire for a complete release from our detested\r\nconfinement led us, after we had sailed a little way up, to hasten our\r\narrival in London by going on board a passing steamer at Gravesend. As\r\nwe neared the capital, our astonishment steadily increased at the\r\nnumber of ships of all sorts that filled the river, the houses, the\r\nstreets, the famous docks, and other maritime constructions which lined\r\nthe banks. When at last we reached London Bridge, this incredibly\r\ncrowded centre of the greatest city in the world, and set foot on land\r\nafter our terrible three weeks’ voyage, a pleasurable sensation of\r\ngiddiness overcame us as our legs carried us staggering through the\r\ndeafening uproar. Robber seemed to be similarly affected, for he\r\nwhisked round the corners like a mad thing, and threatened to get lost\r\nevery other minute. But we soon sought safety in a cab, which took us,\r\non our captain’s recommendation, to the Horseshoe Tavern, near the\r\nTower, and here we had to make our plans for the conquest of this giant\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood in which we found ourselves was such that we decided\r\nto leave it with all possible haste. A very friendly little hunchbacked\r\nJew from Hamburg suggested better quarters in the West End, and I\r\nremember vividly our drive there, in one of the tiny narrow cabs then\r\nin use, the journey lasting fully an hour. They were built to carry two\r\npeople, who had to sit facing each other, and we therefore had to lay\r\nour big dog crosswise from window to window. The sights we saw from our\r\nwhimsical nook surpassed anything we had imagined, and we arrived at\r\nour boarding-house in Old Compton Street agreeably stimulated by the\r\nlife and the overwhelming size of the great city. Although at the age\r\nof twelve I had made what I supposed to be a translation of a monologue\r\nfrom Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, I found my knowledge of English\r\nquite inadequate when it came to conversing with the landlady of the\r\nKing’s Arms. But the good dame’s social condition as a sea-captain’s\r\nwidow led her to think she could talk French to me, and her attempts\r\nmade me wonder which of us knew least of that language. And then a most\r\ndisturbing incident occurred—we missed Robber, who must have run away\r\nat the door instead of following us into the house. Our distress at\r\nhaving lost our good dog after having brought him all the way there\r\nwith such difficulty occupied us exclusively during the first two hours\r\nwe spent in this new home on land. We kept constant watch at the window\r\nuntil, of a sudden, we joyfully recognised Robber strolling\r\nunconcernedly towards the house from a side street. Afterwards we\r\nlearned that our truant had wandered as far as Oxford Street in search\r\nof adventures, and I have always considered his amazing return to a\r\nhouse which he had not even entered as a strong proof of the absolute\r\ncertainty of the animal’s instincts in the matter of memory.\r\n\r\nWe now had time to realise the tiresome after-effects of the voyage.\r\nThe continuous swaying of the floor and our clumsy efforts to keep from\r\nfalling we found fairly entertaining; but when we came to take our\r\nwell-earned rest in the huge English double bed, and found that that\r\ntoo rocked up and down, it became quite unbearable. Every time we\r\nclosed our eyes we sank into frightful abysses, and, springing up\r\nagain, cried out for help. It seemed as if that terrible voyage would\r\ngo on to the end of our lives. Added to this we felt miserably sick;\r\nfor, after the atrocious food on board, we had been only too ready to\r\npartake, with less discretion than relish, of tastier fare.\r\n\r\nWe were so exhausted by all these trials that we forgot to consider\r\nwhat was, after all, the vital question—the probable result in hard\r\ncash. Indeed, the marvels of the great city proved so fascinating, that\r\nwe started off in a cab, for all the world as if we were on a pleasure\r\ntrip, to follow up a plan I had sketched on my map of London. In our\r\nwonder and delight at what we saw, we quite forgot all we had gone\r\nthrough. Costly as it proved, I considered our week’s stay justified in\r\nview of Minna’s need of rest in the first place, and secondly, the\r\nexcellent opportunity it afforded me of making acquaintances in the\r\nmusical world. During my last visit to Dresden I had sent Rule\r\nBritannia, the overture composed at Königsberg, to Sir John Smart,\r\npresident of the Philharmonic Society. It is true he had never\r\nacknowledged it, but I felt it the more incumbent on me to bring him to\r\ntask about it. I therefore spent some days trying to find out where he\r\nlived, wondering meanwhile in which language I should have to make\r\nmyself understood, but as the result of my inquiries I discovered that\r\nSmart was not in London at all. I next persuaded myself that it would\r\nbe a good thing to look up Bulwer Lytton, and to come to an\r\nunderstanding about the operatic performance of his novel, Rienzi,\r\nwhich I had dramatised. Having been told, on the continent, that Bulwer\r\nwas a member of Parliament, I went to the House, after a few days, to\r\ninquire on the spot. My total ignorance of the English language stood\r\nme in good stead here, and I was treated with unexpected consideration;\r\nfor, as none of the lower officials in that vast building could make\r\nout what I wanted, I was sent, step by step, to one high dignitary\r\nafter the other, until at last I was introduced to a\r\ndistinguished-looking man, who came out of a large hall as we passed,\r\nas an entirely unintelligible individual. (Minna was with me all the\r\ntime; only Robber. had been left behind at the King’s Arms.) He asked\r\nme very civilly what I wanted, in French, and seemed favourably\r\nimpressed when I inquired for the celebrated author. He was obliged to\r\ntell me, however, that he was not in London. I went on to ask whether I\r\ncould not be admitted to a debate, but was told that, in consequence of\r\nthe old Houses of Parliament having been burnt down, they were using\r\ntemporary premises where the space was so limited that only a few\r\nfavoured visitors could procure cards of admittance. But on my pressing\r\nmore urgently he relented, and shortly after opened a door leading\r\ndirect into the strangers’ seats in the House of Lords. It seemed\r\nreasonable to conclude from this that our friend was a lord in person.\r\nI was immensely interested to see and hear the Premier, Lord Melbourne,\r\nand Brougham (who seemed to me to take a very active part in the\r\nproceedings, prompting Melbourne several times, as I thought), and the\r\nDuke of Wellington, who looked so comfortable in his grey beaver hat,\r\nwith his hands diving deep into his trousers pockets, and who made his\r\nspeech in so conversational a tone that I lost my feeling of excessive\r\nawe. He had a curious way, too, of accenting his points of special\r\nemphasis by shaking his whole body, I was also much interested in Lord\r\nLyndhurst, Brougham’s particular enemy, and was amazed to see Brougham\r\ngo across several times to sit down coolly beside him, apparently with\r\na view to prompting even his opponent. The matter in hand was, as I\r\nlearned afterwards from the papers, the discussion of measures to be\r\ntaken against the Portuguese Government to ensure the passing of the\r\nAnti-Slavery Bill. The Bishop of London, who was one of the speakers on\r\nthis occasion, was the only one of these gentlemen whose voice and\r\nmanner seemed to me stiff or unnatural, but possibly I was prejudiced\r\nby my dislike of parsons generally.\r\n\r\nAfter this pleasing adventure I imagined I had exhausted the\r\nattractions of London for the present, for although I could not gain\r\nadmittance to the Lower House, my untiring friend, whom I came across\r\nagain as I went out, showed me the room where the Commons sat,\r\nexplained as much as was necessary, and gave me a sight of the\r\nSpeaker’s woolsack, and of his mace lying hidden under the table. He\r\nalso gave me such careful details of various things that I felt I knew\r\nall there was to know about the capital of Great Britain. I had not the\r\nsmallest intention of going to the Italian opera, possibly because I\r\nimagined the prices to be too ruinous. We thoroughly explored all the\r\nprincipal streets, often tiring ourselves out; we shuddered through a\r\nghastly London Sunday, and wound up with a train trip (our very first)\r\nto Gravesend Park, in the company of the captain of the Thetis. On the\r\n20th of August we crossed over to France by steamer, arriving the same\r\nevening at Boulogne-sur-mer, where we took leave of the sea with the\r\nfervent desire never to go on it again.\r\n\r\nWe were both of us secretly convinced that we should meet with\r\ndisappointments in Paris, and it was partly on that account that we\r\ndecided to spend a few weeks at or near Boulogne. It was, in any case,\r\ntoo early in the season to find the various important people whom I\r\nproposed to see, in town; on the other hand, it seemed to me a most\r\nfortunate circumstance that Meyerbeer should happen to be at Boulogne.\r\nAlso, I had the instrumentation of part of the second act of Rienzi to\r\nfinish, and was bent on having at least half of the work ready to show\r\non my arrival in the costly French capital. We therefore set out to\r\nfind less expensive accommodation in the country round Boulogne.\r\nBeginning with the immediate neighbourhood, our search ended in our\r\ntaking two practically unfurnished rooms in the detached house of a\r\nrural wine merchant’s, situated on the main road to Paris at half an\r\nhour’s distance from Boulogne. We next provided scanty but adequate\r\nfurniture, and in bringing our wits to bear upon this matter Minna\r\nparticularly distinguished herself. Besides a bed and two chairs, we\r\ndug up a table, which, after I had cleared away my Rienzi papers,\r\nserved for our meals, which we had to prepare at our own fireside.\r\n\r\nWhile we were here I made my first call on Meyerbeer. I had often read\r\nin the papers of his proverbial amiability, and bore him no ill-will\r\nfor not replying to my letter. My favourable opinion was soon to be\r\nconfirmed, however, by his kind reception of me. The impression he made\r\nwas good in every respect, particularly as regards his appearance. The\r\nyears had not yet given his features the flabby look which sooner or\r\nlater mars most Jewish faces, and the fine formation of his brow round\r\nabout the eyes gave him an expression of countenance that inspired\r\nconfidence. He did not seem in the least inclined to depreciate my\r\nintention of trying my luck in Paris as a composer of opera; he allowed\r\nme to read him my libretto for Rienzi, and really listened up to the\r\nend of the third act. He kept the two acts that were complete, saying\r\nthat he wished to look them over, and assured me, when I again called\r\non him, of his whole-hearted interest in my work. Be this as it may, it\r\nannoyed me somewhat that he should again and again fall back on\r\npraising my minute handwriting, an accomplishment he considered\r\nespecially Saxonian. He promised to give me letters of recommendation\r\nto Duponchel, the manager of the Opera House, and to Habeneck, the\r\nconductor. I now felt that I had good cause to extol my good fortune\r\nwhich, after many vicissitudes, had sent me precisely to this\r\nparticular spot in France. What better fortune could have befallen me\r\nthan to secure, in so short a time, the sympathetic interest of the\r\nmost famous composer of French opera! Meyerbeer took me to see\r\nMoscheles, who was then in Boulogne, and also Fraulein Blahedka, a\r\ncelebrated virtuoso whose name I had known for many years. I spent a\r\nfew informal musical evenings at both houses, and thus came into close\r\ntouch with musical celebrities, an experience quite new to me.\r\n\r\nI had written to my future brother-in-law, Avernarius, in Paris, to ask\r\nhim to find us suitable accommodations, and we started on our journey\r\nthither on 16th September in the diligence, my efforts to hoist Robber\r\non to the top being attended by the usual difficulties.\r\n\r\nMy first impression of Paris proved disappointing in view of the great\r\nexpectations I had cherished of that city; after London it seemed to me\r\nnarrow and confined. I had imagined the famous boulevards to be much\r\nvaster, for instance, and was really annoyed, when the huge coach put\r\nus down in the Rue de la Juissienne, to think that I should first set\r\nfoot on Parisian soil in such a wretched little alley. Neither did the\r\nRue Richelieu, where my brother-in-law had his book-shop, seem imposing\r\nafter the streets in the west end of London. As for the chambre garnie,\r\nwhich had been engaged for me in the Rue de la Tonnellerie, one of the\r\nnarrow side-streets which link the Rue St. Honore with the Marche des\r\nInnocents, I felt positively degraded at having to take up my abode\r\nthere. I needed all the consolation that could be derived from an\r\ninscription, placed under a bust of Moliere, which read: maison ou\r\nnaquit Moliere, to raise my courage after the mean impression the house\r\nhad first made upon me. The room, which had been prepared for us on the\r\nfourth floor, was small but cheerful, decently furnished, and\r\ninexpensive. From the windows we could see the frightful bustle in the\r\nmarket below, which became more and more alarming as we watched it, and\r\nI wondered what we were doing in such a quarter.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Avenarius had to go to Leipzig to bring home his\r\nbride, my youngest sister Cecilia, after the wedding in that city.\r\nBefore leaving, he gave me an introduction to his only musical\r\nacquaintance, a German holding an appointment in the music department\r\nof the Bibliotheque Royale, named E. G. Anders, who lost no time in\r\nlooking us up in Moliere’s house. He was, as I soon discovered, a man\r\nof very unusual character, and, little as he was able to help me, he\r\nleft an affecting and ineffaceable impression on my memory. He was a\r\nbachelor in the fifties, whose reverses had driven him to the sad\r\nnecessity of earning a living in Paris entirely without assistance. He\r\nhad fallen back on the extraordinary bibliographical knowledge which,\r\nespecially in reference to music, it had been his hobby to acquire in\r\nthe days of his prosperity. His real name he never told me, wishing to\r\nguard the secret of that, as of his misfortunes, until after his death.\r\nFor the time being he told me only that he was known as Anders, was of\r\nnoble descent, and had held property on the Rhine, but that he had lost\r\neverything owing to the villainous betrayal of his gullibility and\r\ngood-nature. The only thing he had managed to save was his very\r\nconsiderable library, the size of which I was able to estimate for\r\nmyself. It filled every wall of his small dwelling. Even here in Paris\r\nhe soon complained of bitter enemies; for, in spite of having come\r\nfurnished with an introduction to influential people, he still held the\r\ninferior position of an employee in the library. In spite of his long\r\nservice there and his great learning, he had to see really ignorant men\r\npromoted over his head. I discovered afterwards that the real reason\r\nlay in his unbusinesslike methods, and the effeminacy consequent on the\r\ndelicate way in which he had been nurtured in early life, which made\r\nhim incapable of developing the energy necessary for his work. On a\r\nmiserable pittance of fifteen hundred francs a year, he led a weary\r\nexistence, full of anxiety. With nothing in view but a lonely old age,\r\nand the probability of dying in a hospital, it seemed as if our society\r\nput new life into him; for though we were poverty-stricken, we looked\r\nforward boldly and hopefully to the future. My vivacity and invincible\r\nenergy filled him with hopes of my success, and from this time forward\r\nhe took a most tender and unselfish part in furthering my interests.\r\nAlthough he was a contributor to the Gazette Musicale, edited by Moritz\r\nSchlesinger, he had never succeeded in making his influence felt there\r\nin the slightest degree. He had none of the versatility of a\r\njournalist, and the editors entrusted him with little besides the\r\npreparation of bibliographical notes. Oddly enough, it was with this\r\nunworldly and least resourceful of men that I had to discuss my plan\r\nfor the conquest of Paris, that is, of musical Paris, which is made up\r\nof all the most questionable characters imaginable. The result was\r\npractically always the same; we merely encouraged each other in the\r\nhope that some unforeseen stroke of luck would help my cause.\r\n\r\nTo assist us in these discussions Anders called in his friend and\r\nhousemate Lehrs, a philologist, my acquaintance with whom was soon to\r\ndevelop into one of the most beautiful friendships of my life. Lehrs\r\nwas the younger brother of a famous scholar at Königsberg. He had left\r\nthere to come to Paris some years before, with the object of gaining an\r\nindependent position by his philological work. This he preferred, in\r\nspite of the attendant difficulties, to a post as teacher with a salary\r\nwhich only in Germany could be considered sufficient for a scholar’s\r\nwants. He soon obtained work from Didot, the bookseller, as assistant\r\neditor of a large edition of Greek classics, but the editor traded on\r\nhis poverty, and was much more concerned about the success of his\r\nenterprise than about the condition of his poor collaborator. Lehrs had\r\ntherefore perpetually to struggle against poverty, but he preserved an\r\neven temper, and showed himself in every way a model of\r\ndisinterestedness and self-sacrifice. At first he looked upon me only\r\nas a man in need of advice, and incidentally a fellow-sufferer in\r\nParis; for he had no knowledge of music, and had no particular interest\r\nin it. We soon became so intimate that I had him dropping in nearly\r\nevery evening with Anders, Lehrs being extremely useful to his friend,\r\nwhose unsteadiness in walking obliged him to use an umbrella and a\r\nwalking-stick as crutches. He was also nervous in crossing crowded\r\nthorough-fares, and particularly so at night; while he always liked to\r\nmake Lehrs cross my threshold in front of him to distract the attention\r\nof Robber, of whom he stood in obvious terror. Our usually good-natured\r\ndog became positively suspicious of this visitor, and soon adopted\r\ntowards him the same aggressive attitude which he had shown to the\r\nsailor Koske on board the Thetis. The two men lived at an hotel garni\r\nin Rue de Seine. They complained greatly of their landlady, who\r\nappropriated so much of their income that they were entirely in her\r\npower. Anders had for years been trying to assert his independence by\r\nleaving her, without being able to carry out his plan. We soon threw\r\noff mutually every shred of disguise as to the present state of our\r\nfinances, so that, although the two house-holds were actually\r\nseparated, our common troubles gave us all the intimacy of one united\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe various ways by which I might obtain recognition in Paris formed\r\nthe chief topic of our discussions at that time. Our hopes were at\r\nfirst centred on Meyerbeer’s promised letters of introduction.\r\nDuponchel, the director of the Opera, did actually see me at his\r\noffice, where, fixing a monocle in his right eye, he read through\r\nMeyerbeer’s letter without betraying the least emotion, having no doubt\r\nopened similar communications from the composer many times before. I\r\nwent away, and never heard another word from him. The elderly\r\nconductor, Habeneck, on the other hand, took an interest in my work\r\nthat was not merely polite, and acceded to my request to have something\r\nof mine played at one of the orchestral practises at the Conservatoire\r\nas soon as he should have leisure. I had, unfortunately, no short\r\ninstrumental piece that seemed suitable except my queer Columbus\r\nOverture, which I considered the most effective of all that had\r\nemanated from my pen. It had been received with great applause on the\r\noccasion of its performance in the theatre at Magdeburg, with the\r\nassistance of the valiant trumpeters from the Prussian garrison. I gave\r\nHabeneck the score and parts, and was able to report to our committee\r\nat home that I had now one enterprise on foot.\r\n\r\nI gave up the attempt to try and see Scribe on the mere ground of our\r\nhaving had some correspondence, for my friends had made it clear to me,\r\nin the light of their own experience, that it was out of the question\r\nto expect this exceptionally busy author to occupy himself seriously\r\nwith a young and unknown musician. Anders was able to introduce me to\r\nanother acquaintance, however, a certain M. Dumersan. This grey-haired\r\ngentleman had written some hundred vaudeville pieces, and would have\r\nbeen glad to see one of them performed as an opera on a larger scale\r\nbefore his death. He had no idea of standing on his dignity as an\r\nauthor, and was quite willing to undertake the translation of an\r\nexisting libretto into French verse. We therefore entrusted him with\r\nthe writing of my Liebesverbot, with a view to a performance at the\r\nTheatre de la Renaissance, as it was then called. (It was the third\r\nexisting theatre for lyric drama, the performances being given in the\r\nnew Salle Ventadour, which had been rebuilt after its destruction by\r\nfire.) On the understanding that it was to be a literal translation, he\r\nat once turned the three numbers of my opera, for which I hoped to\r\nsecure a hearing, into neat French verse. Besides this, he asked me to\r\ncompose a chorus for a vaudeville entitled La Descente de la Courtille,\r\nwhich was to be played at the Varietes during the carnival.\r\n\r\nThis was a second opening. My friends now strongly advised me to write\r\nsomething small in the way of songs, which I could offer to popular\r\nsingers for concert purposes. Both Lehrs and Anders produced words for\r\nthese. Anders brought a very innocent Dors, mon enfant, written by a\r\nyoung poet of his acquaintance; this was the first thing I composed to\r\na French text. It was so successful that, when I had tried it over\r\nsoftly several times on the piano, my wife, who was in bed, called out\r\nto me that it was heavenly for sending one to sleep. I also set\r\nL’Attente from Hugo’s Orientales, and Ronsard’s song, Mignonne, to\r\nmusic. I have no reason to be ashamed of these small pieces, which I\r\npublished subsequently as a musical supplement to Europa (Lewald’s\r\npublication) in 1841.\r\n\r\nI next stumbled on the idea of writing a grand bass aria with a chorus,\r\nfor Lablache to introduce into his part of Orovist in Bellini’s Norma.\r\nLehrs had to hunt up an Italian political refugee to get the text out\r\nof him. This was done, and I produced an effective composition a la\r\nBellini (which still exists among my manuscripts), and went off at once\r\nto offer it to Lablache.\r\n\r\nThe friendly Moor, who received me in the great singer’s anteroom,\r\ninsisted upon admitting me straight into his master’s presence without\r\nannouncing me. As I had anticipated some difficulty in getting near\r\nsuch a celebrity, I had written my request, as I thought this would be\r\nsimpler than explaining verbally.\r\n\r\nThe black servant’s pleasant manner made me feel very uncomfortable; I\r\nentrusted my score and letter to him to give to Lablache, without\r\ntaking any notice of his kindly astonishment at my refusal of his\r\nrepeated invitation to go into his master’s room and have an interview,\r\nand I left the house hurriedly, intending to call for my answer in a\r\nfew days. When I came back Lablache received me most kindly, and\r\nassured me that my aria was excellent, though it was impossible to\r\nintroduce it into Bellini’s opera after the latter had already been\r\nperformed so very often. My relapse into the domain of Bellini’s style,\r\nof which I had been guilty through the writing of this aria, was\r\ntherefore useless to me, and I soon became convinced of the\r\nfruitlessness of my efforts in that direction. I saw that I should need\r\npersonal introductions to various singers in order to ensure the\r\nproduction of one of my other compositions.\r\n\r\nWhen Meyerbeer at last arrived in Paris, therefore, I was delighted. He\r\nwas not in the least astonished at the lack of success of his letters\r\nof introduction; on the contrary, he made use of this opportunity to\r\nimpress upon me how difficult it was to get on in Paris, and how\r\nnecessary it was for me to look out for less pretentious work. With\r\nthis object he introduced me to Maurice Schlesinger, and leaving me at\r\nthe mercy of that monstrous person, went back to Germany.\r\n\r\nAt first Schlesinger did not know what to do with me; the acquaintances\r\nI made through him (of whom the chief was the violinist Panofka) led to\r\nnothing, and I therefore returned to my advisory board at home, through\r\nwhose influence I had recently received an order to compose the music\r\nto the Two Grenadiers, by Heine, translated by a Parisian professor. I\r\nwrote this song for baritone, and was very pleased with the result; on\r\nAnder’s advice I now tried to find singers for my new compositions.\r\nMme. Pauline Viardot, on whom I first called, went through my songs\r\nwith me. She was very amiable, and praised them, but did not see why\r\nSHE should sing them. I went through the same experience with a Mme.\r\nWidmann, a grand contralto, who sang my Dors, mon enfant with great\r\nfeeling; all the same she had no further use for my composition. A\r\ncertain M. Dupont, third tenor at the grand opera, tried my setting of\r\nthe Ronsard poem, but declared that the language in which it was\r\nwritten was no longer palatable to the Paris public. M. Geraldy, a\r\nfavourite concert singer and teacher, who allowed me to call and see\r\nhim frequently, told me that the Two Grenadiers was impossible, for the\r\nsimple reason that the accompaniment at the end of the song, which I\r\nhad modelled upon the Marseillaise, could only be sung in the streets\r\nof Paris to the accompaniment of cannons and gunshots. Habeneck was the\r\nonly person who fulfilled his promise to conduct my Columbus Overture\r\nat one of the rehearsals for the benefit of Anders and myself. As,\r\nhowever, there was no question of producing this work even at one of\r\nthe celebrated Conservatoire concerts, I saw clearly that the old\r\ngentleman was only moved by kindness and a desire to encourage me. It\r\ncould not lead to anything further, and I myself was convinced that\r\nthis extremely superficial work of my young days could only give the\r\norchestra a wrong impression of my talents. However, these rehearsals,\r\nto my surprise, made such an unexpected impression on me in other ways\r\nthat they exercised a decisive influence in the crisis of my artistic\r\ndevelopment. This was due to the fact that I listened repeatedly to\r\nBeethoven’s Ninth Symphony, which, by dint of untiring practice,\r\nreceived such a marvellous interpretation at the hands of this\r\ncelebrated orchestra, that the picture I had had of it in my mind in\r\nthe enthusiastic days of my youth now stood before me almost tangibly\r\nin brilliant colours, undimmed, as though it had never been effaced by\r\nthe Leipzig orchestra who had slaughtered it under Pohlenz’s baton.\r\nWhere formerly I had only seen mystic constellations and weird shapes\r\nwithout meaning, I now found, flowing from innumerable sources, a\r\nstream of the most touching and heavenly melodies which delighted my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe whole of that period of the deterioration of my musical tastes\r\nwhich dated, practically speaking, from those selfsame confusing ideas\r\nabout Beethoven, and which had grown so much worse through my\r\nacquaintance with that dreadful theatre—all these wrong views now sank\r\ndown as if into an abyss of shame and remorse.\r\n\r\nThis inner change had been gradually prepared by many painful\r\nexperiences during the last few years. I owed the recovery of my old\r\nvigour and spirits to the deep impression the rendering of the Ninth\r\nSymphony had made on me when performed in a way I had never dreamed of.\r\nThis important event in my life can only be compared to the upheaval\r\ncaused within me when, as a youth of sixteen, I saw Schroder-Devrient\r\nact in Fidelio.\r\n\r\nThe direct result of this was my intense longing to compose something\r\nthat would give me a similar feeling of satisfaction, and this desire\r\ngrew in proportion to my anxiety about my unfortunate position in\r\nParis, which made me almost despair of success.\r\n\r\nIn this mood I sketched an overture to Faust which, according to my\r\noriginal scheme, was only to form the first part of a whole Faust\r\nSymphony, as I had already got the ‘Gretchen’ idea in my head for the\r\nsecond movement. This is the same composition that I rewrote in several\r\nparts fifteen years later; I had forgotten all about it, and I owed its\r\nreconstruction to the advice of Liszt, who gave me many valuable hints.\r\nThis composition has been performed many times under the title of eine\r\nFaust-ouverture, and has met with great appreciation. At the time of\r\nwhich I am speaking, I hoped that the Conservatoire orchestra would\r\nhave been willing to give the work a hearing, but I was told they\r\nthought they had done enough for me, and hoped to be rid of me for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHaving failed everywhere, I now turned to Meyerbeer for more\r\nintroductions, especially to singers. I was very much surprised when,\r\nin consequence of my request, Meyerbeer introduced me to a certain M.\r\nGouin, a post-office official, and Meyerbeer’s sole agent in Paris,\r\nwhom he instructed to do his utmost for me. Meyerbeer specially wished\r\nme to know M. Antenor Joly, director of the Theatre de la Renaissance,\r\nthe musical theatre already mentioned. M. Gouin, with almost suspicious\r\nlevity, promised me to produce my opera Liebesverbot, which now only\r\nrequired translation. There was a question of having a few numbers of\r\nmy opera sung to the committee of the theatre at a special audience.\r\nWhen I suggested that some of the singers of this very theatre should\r\nundertake to sing three of the numbers which had been already\r\ntranslated by Dumersan, I was refused on the plea that all these\r\nartists were far too busy. But Gouin saw a way out of the difficulty;\r\non the authority of Maître Meyerbeer, he won over to our cause several\r\nsingers who were under an obligation to Meyerbeer: Mme. Dorus-Gras, a\r\nreal primadonna of the Grand Opera, Mme. Widmann and M. Dupont (the two\r\nlast-named had previously refused to help me) now promised to sing for\r\nme at this audience.\r\n\r\nThis much, then, did I achieve in six months. It was now nearly Easter\r\nof the year 1840. Encouraged by Gouin’s negotiations, which seemed to\r\nspell hope, I made up my mind to move from the obscure Quartier des\r\nInnocents to a part of Paris nearer to the musical centre; and in this\r\nI was encouraged by Lehrs’ foolhardy advice.\r\n\r\nWhat this change meant to me, my readers will learn when they hear\r\nunder what circumstances we had dragged on our existence during our\r\nstay in Paris.\r\n\r\nAlthough we were living in the cheapest possible way, dining at a very\r\nsmall restaurant for a franc a head, it was impossible to prevent the\r\nrest of our money from melting away. Our friend Möller had given us to\r\nunderstand that we could ask him if we were in need, as he would put\r\naside for us the first money that came in from any successful business\r\ntransaction. There was no alternative but to apply to him for money; in\r\nthe meantime we pawned all the trinkets we possessed that were of any\r\nvalue. As I was too shy to make inquiries about a pawnshop, I looked up\r\nthe French equivalent in the dictionary in order to be able to\r\nrecognise such a place when I saw it. In my little pocket dictionary I\r\ncould not find any other word than ‘Lombard.’ On looking at a map of\r\nParis I found, situated in the middle of an inextricable maze of\r\nstreets, a very small lane called Rue des Lombards. Thither I wended my\r\nway, but my expedition was fruitless. Often, on reading by the light of\r\nthe transparent lanterns the inscription ‘Mont de Piété,’ I became very\r\ncurious to know its meaning, and on consulting my advisory board at\r\nhome about this ‘Mount of Piety,’[9]    I was told, to my great\r\ndelight, that it was precisely there that I should find salvation. To\r\nthis ‘Mont de Piété’ we now carried all we possessed in the way of\r\nsilver, namely, our wedding presents. After that followed my wife’s\r\ntrinkets and the rest of her former theatrical wardrobe, amongst which\r\nwas a beautiful silver-embroidered blue dress with a court train, once\r\nthe property of the Duchess of Dessau. Still we heard nothing from our\r\nfriend Möller, and we were obliged to wait on from day to day for the\r\nsorely needed help from Königsberg, and at last, one dark day, we\r\npledged our wedding rings. When all hope of assistance seemed vain, I\r\nheard that the pawn-tickets themselves were of some value, as they\r\ncould be sold to buyers, who thereby acquired the right to redeem the\r\npawned articles. I had to resort even to this, and thus the blue\r\ncourt-dress, for instance, was lost for ever. Möller never wrote again.\r\nWhen later on he called on me at the time of my conductorship in\r\nDresden, he admitted that he had been embittered against me owing to\r\nhumiliating and derogatory remarks we were said to have made about him\r\nafter we parted, and had resolved not to have anything further to do\r\nwith us. We were certain of our innocence in the matter, and very\r\ngrieved at having, through pure slander, lost the chance of such\r\nassistance in our great need.\r\n\r\n [9] This is the correct translation of the words _Berg der\r\n Frömmigkeit_ used in the original.—Editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of our pecuniary difficulties we sustained a loss\r\nwhich we looked upon as providential, in spite of the grief it caused\r\nus. This was our beautiful dog, which we had managed to bring across to\r\nParis with endless difficulty. As he was a very valuable animal, and\r\nattracted much attention, he had probably been stolen. In spite of the\r\nterrible state of the traffic in Paris, he had always found his way\r\nhome in the same clever manner in which he had mastered the\r\ndifficulties of the London streets. Quite at the beginning of our stay\r\nin Paris he had often gone off by himself to the gardens of the Palais\r\nRoyal, where he used to meet many of his friends, and had returned safe\r\nand sound after a brilliant exhibition of swimming and retrieving\r\nbefore an audience of gutter children. At the Quai du Pont-neuf he\r\ngenerally begged us to let him bathe; there he used to draw a large\r\ncrowd of spectators round him, who were so loud in their enthusiasm\r\nabout the way in which he dived for and brought to land various objects\r\nof clothing, tools, etc., that the police begged us to put an end to\r\nthe obstruction. One morning I let him out for a little run as usual;\r\nhe never returned, and in spite of our most strenuous efforts to\r\nrecover him, no trace of him was to be found. This loss seemed to many\r\nof our friends a piece of luck, for they could not understand how it\r\nwas possible for us to feed such a huge animal when we ourselves had\r\nnot enough to eat. About this time, the second month of our stay in\r\nParis, my sister Louisa came over from Leipzig to join her husband,\r\nFriedrich Brockhaus, in Paris, where he had been waiting for her for\r\nsome time. They intended to go to Italy together, and Louisa made use\r\nof this opportunity to buy all kinds of expensive things in Paris. I\r\ndid not expect them to feel any pity for us on account of our foolish\r\nremoval to Paris, and its attendant miseries, or that they should\r\nconsider themselves bound to help us in any way; but although we did\r\nnot try to conceal our position, we derived no benefit from the visit\r\nof our rich relations. Minna was even kind enough to help my sister\r\nwith her luxurious shopping, and we were very anxious not to make them\r\nthink we wanted to rouse their pity. In return my sister introduced me\r\nto an extraordinary friend of hers, who was destined to take a great\r\ninterest in me. This was the young painter, Ernst Kietz, from Dresden;\r\nhe was an exceptionally kind-hearted and unaffected young man, whose\r\ntalent for portrait painting (in a sort of coloured pastel style) had\r\nmade him such a favourite in his own town, that he had been induced by\r\nhis financial successes to come to Paris for a time to finish his art\r\nstudies. He had now been working in Delaroche’s studio for about a\r\nyear. He had a curious and almost childlike disposition, and his lack\r\nof all serious education, combined with a certain weakness of\r\ncharacter, had made him choose a career in which he was destined, in\r\nspite of all his talent, to fail hopelessly. I had every opportunity of\r\nrecognising this, as I saw a great deal of him. At the time, however,\r\nthe simple-hearted devotion and kindness of this young man were very\r\nwelcome both to myself and my wife, who often felt lonely, and his\r\nfriendship was a real source of help in our darkest hours of adversity.\r\nHe became almost a member of the family, and joined our home circle\r\nevery night, providing a strange contrast to nervous old Anders and the\r\ngrave-faced Lehrs. His good-nature and his quaint remarks soon made him\r\nindispensable to us; he amused us tremendously with his French, into\r\nwhich he would launch with the greatest confidence, although he could\r\nnot put together two consecutive sentences properly, in spite of having\r\nlived in Paris for twenty years. With Delaroche he studied\r\noil-painting, and had obviously considerable talent in this direction,\r\nalthough it was the very rock on which he stranded. The mixing of the\r\ncolours on his palette, and especially the cleaning of his brushes,\r\ntook up so much of his time that he rarely came to the actual painting.\r\nAs the days were very short in midwinter, he never had time to do any\r\nwork after he had finished washing his palette and brushes, and, as far\r\nas I can remember, he never completed a single portrait. Strangers to\r\nwhom he had been introduced, and who had given him orders to paint\r\ntheir portraits, were obliged to leave Paris without seeing them even\r\nhalf done, and at last he even complained because some of his sitters\r\ndied before their portraits were completed. His landlord, to whom he\r\nwas always in debt for rent, was the only creature who succeeded in\r\ngetting a portrait of his ugly person from the painter, and, as far as\r\nI know, this is the only finished portrait in existence by Kietz. On\r\nthe other hand, he was very clever at making little sketches of any\r\nsubject suggested by our conversation during the evening, and in these\r\nhe displayed both originality and delicacy of execution. During the\r\nwinter of that year he completed a good pencil portrait of me, which he\r\ntouched up two years afterwards when he knew me more intimately,\r\nfinishing it off as it now stands. It pleased him to sketch me in the\r\nattitude I often assumed during our evening chats when I was in a\r\ncheerful mood. No evening ever passed during which I did not succeed in\r\nshaking off the depression caused by my vain endeavours, and by the\r\nmany worries I had gone through during the day, and in regaining my\r\nnatural cheerfulness, and Kietz was anxious to represent me to the\r\nworld as a man who, in spite of the hard times he had to face, had\r\nconfidence in his success, and rose smiling above the troubles of life.\r\nBefore the end of the year 1839, my youngest sister Cecilia also\r\narrived in Paris with her husband, Edward Avenarius. It was only\r\nnatural that she should feel embarrassed at the idea of meeting us in\r\nParis in our extremely straitened circumstances, especially as her\r\nhusband was not very well off. Consequently, instead of calling on them\r\nfrequently, we preferred waiting until they came to see us, which, by\r\nthe way, took them a long time. On the other hand, the renewal of our\r\nacquaintance with Heinrich Laube, who came over to Paris at the\r\nbeginning of 1840 with his young wife, Iduna (nee Budaus), was very\r\ncheering. She was the widow of a wealthy Leipzig doctor, and Laube had\r\nmarried her under very extraordinary circumstances, since we last saw\r\nhim in Berlin; they intended to enjoy themselves for a few months in\r\nParis. During the long period of his detention, while awaiting his\r\ntrial, this young lady had been so touched by his misfortunes that\r\nwithout knowing much of him, she had shown great sympathy and interest\r\nin his case. Laube’s sentence was pronounced soon after I left Berlin;\r\nit was unexpectedly light, consisting of only one year’s imprisonment\r\nin the town gaol. He was allowed to undergo this term in the prison at\r\nMuskau in Silesia, where he had the advantage of being near his friend,\r\nPrince Puckler, who in his official capacity, and on account of his\r\ninfluence with the governor of the prison, was permitted to afford the\r\nprisoner even the consolation of personal intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe young widow resolved to marry him at the beginning of his term of\r\nimprisonment, so that she might be near him at Muskau with her loving\r\nassistance. To see my old friend under such favourable conditions was\r\nin itself a pleasure to me; I also experienced the liveliest\r\nsatisfaction at finding there was no change in his former sympathetic\r\nattitude. We met frequently; our wives also became friends, and Laube\r\nwas the first to approve in his kindly humorous way of our folly in\r\nmoving to Paris.\r\n\r\nIn his house I made the acquaintance of Heinrich Heine, and both of\r\nthem joked good-humouredly over my extraordinary position, making even\r\nme laugh. Laube felt himself compelled to talk seriously to me about my\r\nexpectations of succeeding in Paris, as he saw that I treated my\r\nsituation, based on such trivial hopes, with a humour that charmed him\r\neven against his better judgment. He tried to think how he could help\r\nme without prejudicing my future. With this object he wanted me to make\r\na more or less plausible sketch of my future plans, so that on his\r\napproaching visit to our native land he might procure some help for me.\r\nI happened just at that time to have come to an exceedingly promising\r\nunderstanding with the management of the Theatre de la Renaissance. I\r\nthus seemed to have obtained a footing, and I thought it safe to\r\nassert, that if I were guaranteed the means of livelihood for six\r\nmonths, I could not fail within that period to accomplish something.\r\nLaube promised to make this provision, and kept his word. He induced\r\none of his wealthy friends in Leipzig, and, following this example, my\r\nwell-to-do relations, to provide me for six months with the necessary\r\nresources, to be paid in monthly instalments through Avenarius.\r\n\r\nWe therefore decided, as I have said, to leave our furnished apartments\r\nand take a flat for ourselves in the Rue du Helder. My prudent, careful\r\nwife had suffered greatly on account of the careless and uncertain\r\nmanner in which I had hitherto controlled our meagre resources, and in\r\nnow undertaking the responsibility, she explained that she understood\r\nhow to keep house more cheaply than we could do by living in furnished\r\nrooms and restaurants. Success justified the step; the serious part of\r\nthe question lay in the fact that we had to start housekeeping without\r\nany furniture of our own, and everything necessary for domestic\r\npurposes had to be procured, though we had not the wherewithal to get\r\nit. In this matter Lehrs, who was well versed in the peculiarities of\r\nParisian life, was able to advise us. In his opinion the only\r\ncompensation for the experiences we had undergone hitherto would be a\r\nsuccess equivalent to my daring. As I did not possess the resources to\r\nallow of long years of patient waiting for success in Paris, I must\r\neither count on extraordinary luck or renounce all my hopes forthwith.\r\nThe longed-for success must come within a year, or I should be ruined.\r\nTherefore I must dare all, as befitted my name, for in my case he was\r\nnot inclined to derive ‘Wagner’[10] from Fuhrwerk. I was to pay my\r\nrent, twelve hundred francs, in quarterly instalments; for the\r\nfurniture and fittings, he recommended me, through his landlady, to a\r\ncarpenter who provided everything that was necessary for what seemed to\r\nbe a reasonable sum, also to be paid by instalments, all of which\r\nappeared very simple. Lehrs maintained that I should do no good in\r\nParis unless I showed the world that I had confidence in myself. My\r\ntrial audience was impending; I felt sure of the Theatre de la\r\nRenaissance, and Dumersan was keenly anxious to make a complete\r\ntranslation of my Liebesverbot into French. So we decided to run the\r\nrisk. On 15th April, to the astonishment of the concierge of the house\r\nin the Rue du Helder, we moved with an exceedingly small amount of\r\nluggage into our comfortable new apartments.\r\n\r\n [10] ‘Wagner’ in German means one who dares, also a Wagoner; and\r\n ‘Fuhrwerk’ means a carriage.—Editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very first visit I received in the rooms I had taken with such high\r\nhopes was from Anders, who came with the tidings that the Theatre de la\r\nRenaissance had just gone bankrupt, and was closed. This news, which\r\ncame on me like a thunder-clap, seemed to portend more than an ordinary\r\nstroke of bad luck; it revealed to me like a flash of lightning the\r\nabsolute emptiness of my prospects. My friends openly expressed the\r\nopinion that Meyerbeer, in sending me from the Grand Opera to this\r\ntheatre, probably knew the whole of the circumstances. I did not pursue\r\nthe line of thought to which this supposition might lead, as I felt\r\ncause enough for bitterness when I wondered what I should do with the\r\nrooms in which I was so nicely installed.\r\n\r\nAs my singers had now practised the portions of Liebesverbot intended\r\nfor the trial audience, I was anxious at least to have them performed\r\nbefore some persons of influence. M. Edouard Monnaie, who had been\r\nappointed temporary director of the Grand Opera after Duponchel’s\r\nretirement, was the less disposed to refuse as the singers who were to\r\ntake part belonged to the institution over which he presided; moreover,\r\nthere was no obligation attached to his presence at the audience. I\r\nalso took the trouble to call on Scribe to invite him to attend, and he\r\naccepted with the kindest alacrity. At last my three pieces were\r\nperformed before these two gentlemen in the green room of the Grand\r\nOpera, and I played the piano accompaniment. They pronounced the music\r\ncharming, and Scribe expressed his willingness to arrange the libretto\r\nfor me as soon as the managers of the opera had decided on accepting\r\nthe piece; all that M. Monnaie had to reply to this offer was that it\r\nwas impossible for them to do so at present. I did not fail to realise\r\nthat these were only polite expressions; but at all events I thought it\r\nvery nice of them, and particularly condescending of Scribe to have got\r\nso far as to think me deserving of a little politeness.\r\n\r\nBut in my heart of hearts I felt really ashamed of having gone back\r\nagain seriously to that superficial early work from which I had taken\r\nthese three pieces. Of course I had only done this because I thought I\r\nshould win success more rapidly in Paris by adapting myself to its\r\nfrivolous taste. My aversion from this kind of taste, which had been\r\nlong growing, coincided with my abandonment of all hopes of success in\r\nParis. I was placed in an exceedingly melancholy situation by the fact\r\nthat my circumstances had so shaped themselves that I dared not express\r\nthis important change in my feelings to any one, especially to my poor\r\nwife. But if I continued to make the best of a bad bargain, I had no\r\nlonger any illusions as to the possibility of success in Paris. Face to\r\nface with unheard-of misery, I shuddered at the smiling aspect which\r\nParis presented in the bright sunshine of May. It was the beginning of\r\nthe slack season for any sort of artistic enterprise in Paris, and from\r\nevery door at which I knocked with feigned hope I was turned away with\r\nthe wretchedly monotonous phrase, Monsieur est a la campagne.\r\n\r\nOn our long walks, when we felt ourselves absolute strangers in the\r\nmidst of the gay throng, I used to romance to my wife about the South\r\nAmerican Free States, far away from all this sinister life, where opera\r\nand music were unknown, and the foundations of a sensible livelihood\r\ncould easily be secured by industry. I told Minna, who was quite in the\r\ndark as to my meaning, of a book I had just read, Zschokke’s Die\r\nGründung von Maryland, in which I found a very seductive account of the\r\nsensation of relief experienced by the European settlers after their\r\nformer sufferings and persecutions. She, being of a more practical turn\r\nof mind, used to point out to me the necessity of procuring means for\r\nour continued existence in Paris, for which she had thought out all\r\nsorts of economies.\r\n\r\nI, for my part, was sketching out the plan of the poem of my Fliegender\r\nHolländer, which I kept steadily before me as a possible means of\r\nmaking a debut in Paris. I put together the material for a single act,\r\ninfluenced by the consideration that I could in this way confine it to\r\nthe simple dramatic developments between the principal characters,\r\nwithout troubling about the tiresome operatic accessories. From a\r\npractical point of view, I thought I could rely on a better prospect\r\nfor the acceptance of my proposed work if it were cast in the form of a\r\none-act opera, such as was frequently given as a curtain raiser before\r\na ballet at the Grand Opera. I wrote about it to Meyerbeer in Berlin,\r\nasking for his help. I also resumed the composition of Rienzi, to the\r\ncompletion of which I was now giving my constant attention.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime our position became more and more gloomy; I was soon\r\ncompelled to draw in advance on the subsidies obtained by Laube, but in\r\nso doing I gradually alienated the sympathy of my brother-in-law\r\nAvenarius, to whom our stay in Paris was incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nOne morning, when we had been anxiously consulting as to the\r\npossibility of raising our first quarter’s rent, a carrier appeared\r\nwith a parcel addressed to me from London; I thought it was an\r\nintervention of Providence, and broke open the seal. At the same moment\r\na receipt-book was thrust into my face for signature, in which I at\r\nonce saw that I had to pay seven francs for carriage. I recognised,\r\nmoreover, that the parcel contained my overture Rule Britannia,\r\nreturned to me from the London Philharmonic Society. In my fury I told\r\nthe bearer that I would not take in the parcel, whereupon he\r\nremonstrated in the liveliest fashion, as I had already opened it. It\r\nwas no use; I did not possess seven francs, and I told him he should\r\nhave presented the bill for the carriage before I had opened the\r\nparcel. So I made him return the only copy of my overture to Messrs.\r\nLaffitte and Gaillard’s firm, to do what they liked with it, and I\r\nnever cared to inquire what became of that manuscript.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Kietz devised a way out of these troubles. He had been\r\ncommissioned by an old lady of Leipzig, called Fraulein Leplay, a rich\r\nand very miserly old maid, to find a cheap lodging in Paris for her and\r\nfor his stepmother, with whom she intended to travel. As our apartment,\r\nthough not spacious, was larger than we actually needed, and had very\r\nquickly become a troublesome burden to us, we did not hesitate for a\r\nmoment to let the larger portion of it to her for the time of her stay\r\nin Paris, which was to last about two months. In addition, my wife\r\nprovided the guests with breakfast, as though they were in furnished\r\napartments, and took a great pride in looking at the few pence she\r\nearned in this way. Although we found this amazing example of\r\nold-maidishness trying enough, the arrangement we had made helped us in\r\nsome degree to tide over the anxious time, and I was able, in spite of\r\nthis disorganisation of our household arrangements, to continue working\r\nin comparative peace at my Rienzi.\r\n\r\nThis became more difficult after Fraulein Leplay’s departure, when we\r\nlet one of our rooms to a German commercial traveller, who in his\r\nleisure hours zealously played the flute. His name was Brix; he was a\r\nmodest, decent fellow, and had been recommended to us by Pecht the\r\npainter, whose acquaintance we had recently made. He had been\r\nintroduced to us by Kietz, who studied with him in Delaroche’s studio.\r\nHe was the very antithesis of Kietz in every way, and obviously endowed\r\nwith less talent, yet he grappled with the task of acquiring the art of\r\noil-painting in the shortest possible time under difficult\r\ncircumstances with an industry and earnestness quite out of the common.\r\nHe was, moreover, well educated, and eagerly assimilated information,\r\nand was very straightforward, earnest, and trustworthy. Without\r\nattaining to the same degree of intimacy with us as our three older\r\nfriends, he was, nevertheless, one of the few who continued to stand by\r\nus in our troubles, and habitually spent nearly every evening in our\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nOne day I received a fresh surprising proof of Laube’s continued\r\nsolicitude on our behalf. The secretary of a certain Count Kuscelew\r\ncalled on us, and after some inquiry into our affairs, the state of\r\nwhich he had heard from Laube at Karlsbad, informed us in a brief and\r\nfriendly way that his patron wished to be of use to us, and with that\r\nobject in view desired to make my acquaintance. In fact, he proposed to\r\nengage a small light opera company in Paris, which was to follow him to\r\nhis Russian estates. He was therefore looking for a musical director of\r\nsufficient experience to assist in recruiting the members in Paris. I\r\ngladly went to the hotel where the count was staying, and there found\r\nan elderly gentleman of frank and agreeable bearing, who willingly\r\nlistened to my little French compositions. Being a shrewd reader of\r\nhuman nature, he saw at a glance that I was not the man for him, and\r\nthough he showed me the most polite attention, he went no further into\r\nthe opera scheme. But that very day he sent me, accompanied by a\r\nfriendly note, ten golden napoleons, in payment for my services. What\r\nthese services were I did not know. I thereupon wrote to him, and asked\r\nfor more precise details of his wishes, and begged him to commission a\r\ncomposition, the fee for which I presumed he had sent in advance. As I\r\nreceived no reply, I made more than one effort to approach him again,\r\nbut in vain. From other sources I afterwards learned that the only kind\r\nof opera Count Kuscelew recognised was Adam’s. As for the operatic\r\ncompany to be engaged to suit his taste, what he really wanted was more\r\na small harem than a company of artists.\r\n\r\nSo far I had not been able to arrange anything with the music publisher\r\nSchlesinger. It was impossible to persuade him to publish my little\r\nFrench songs. In order to do something, however, towards making myself\r\nknown in this direction, I decided to have my Two Grenadiers engraved\r\nby him at my own expense. Kietz was to lithograph a magnificent\r\ntitle-page for it. Schlesinger ended by charging me fifty francs for\r\nthe cost of production. The story of this publication is curious from\r\nbeginning to end; the work bore Schlesinger’s name, and as I had\r\ndefrayed all expenses, the proceeds were, of course, to be placed to my\r\naccount. I had afterwards to take the publisher’s word for it that not\r\na single copy had been sold. Subsequently, when I had made a quick\r\nreputation for myself in Dresden through my Rienzi, Schott the\r\npublisher in Mainz, who dealt almost exclusively in works translated\r\nfrom the French, thought it advisable to bring out a German edition of\r\nthe Two Grenadiers. Below the text of the French translation he had the\r\nGerman original by Heine printed; but as the French poem was a very\r\nfree paraphrase, in quite a different metre to the original, Heine’s\r\nwords fitted my composition so badly that I was furious at the insult\r\nto my work, and thought it necessary to protest against Schott’s\r\npublication as an entirely unauthorised reprint. Schott then threatened\r\nme with an action for libel, as he said that, according to his\r\nagreement, his edition was not a reprint (Nachdruck), but a\r\nreimpression (Abdruck). In order to be spared further annoyance, I was\r\ninduced to send him an apology in deference to the distinction he had\r\ndrawn, which I did not understand.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, when I made inquiries of Schlesinger’s successor in Paris (M.\r\nBrandus) as to the fate of my little work, I learned from him that a\r\nnew edition had been published, but he declined to entertain any\r\nquestion of rights on my part. Since I did not care to buy a copy with\r\nmy own money, I have to this day had to do without my own property. To\r\nwhat extent, in later years, others profited by similar transactions\r\nrelating to the publication of my works, will appear in due course.\r\n\r\nFor the moment the point was to compensate Schlesinger for the fifty\r\nfrancs agreed upon, and he proposed that I should do this by writing\r\narticles for his Gazette Musicale.\r\n\r\nAs I was not expert enough in the French language for literary\r\npurposes, my article had to be translated and half the fee had to go to\r\nthe translator. However, I consoled myself by thinking I should still\r\nreceive sixty francs per sheet for the work. I was soon to learn, when\r\nI presented myself to the angry publisher for payment, what was meant\r\nby a sheet. It was measured by an abominable iron instrument, on which\r\nthe lines of the columns were marked off with figures; this was applied\r\nto the article, and after careful subtraction of the spaces left for\r\nthe title and signature, the lines were added up. After this process\r\nhad been gone through, it appeared that what I had taken for a sheet\r\nwas only half a sheet.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. I began to write articles for Schlesinger’s wonderful\r\npaper. The first was a long essay, De la musique allemande, in which I\r\nexpressed with the enthusiastic exaggeration characteristic of me at\r\nthat time my appreciation of the sincerity and earnestness of German\r\nmusic. This article led my friend Anders to remark that the state of\r\naffairs in Germany must, indeed, be splendid if the conditions were\r\nreally as I described. I enjoyed what was to me the surprising\r\nsatisfaction of seeing this article subsequently reproduced in Italian,\r\nin a Milan musical journal, where, to my amusement, I saw myself\r\ndescribed as Dottissimo Musico Tedesco, a mistake which nowadays would\r\nbe impossible. My essay attracted favourable comment, and Schlesinger\r\nasked me to write an article in praise of the arrangement made by the\r\nRussian General Lwoff of Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater, which I did as\r\nsuperficially as possible. On my own impulse I then wrote an essay in a\r\nstill more amiable vein called Du metier du virtuose et de\r\nl’independance de la composition.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I was surprised in the middle of the summer by the\r\narrival of Meyerbeer, who happened to come to Paris for a fortnight. He\r\nwas very sympathetic and obliging. When I told him my idea of writing a\r\none-act opera as a curtain raiser, and asked him to give me an\r\nintroduction to M. Leon Pillet, the recently appointed manager of the\r\nGrand Opera, he at once took me to see him, and presented me to him.\r\nBut alas, I had the unpleasant surprise of learning from the serious\r\nconversation which took place between those two gentlemen as to my\r\nfuture, that Meyerbeer thought I had better decide to compose an act\r\nfor the ballet in collaboration with another musician. Of course I\r\ncould not entertain such an idea for a moment. I succeeded, however, in\r\nhanding over to M. Pillet my brief sketch of the subject of the Flying\r\nDutchman..\r\n\r\nThings had reached this point when Meyerbeer again left Paris, this\r\ntime for a longer period of absence.\r\n\r\nAs I did not hear from M. Pillet for quite a long time, I now began to\r\nwork diligently at my composition of Rienzi, though, to my great\r\ndistress, I had often to interrupt this task in order to undertake\r\ncertain pot-boiling hack-work for Schlesinger.\r\n\r\nAs my contributions to the Gazette Musicale proved so unremunerative,\r\nSchlesinger one day ordered me to work out a method for the Cornet a\r\npistons. When I told him about my embarrassment, in not knowing how to\r\ndeal with the subject, he replied by sending me five different\r\npublished ‘Methods’ for the Cornet a pistons, at that time the\r\nfavourite amateur instrument among the younger male population of\r\nParis. I had merely to devise a new sixth method out of these five, as\r\nall Schlesinger wanted was to publish an edition of his own. I was\r\nracking my brains how to start, when Schlesinger, who had just obtained\r\na new complete method, released me from the onerous task. I was,\r\nhowever, told to write fourteen ‘Suites’ for the Cornet a pistons—that\r\nis to say, airs out of operas arranged for this instrument. To furnish\r\nme with material for this work, Schlesinger sent me no less than sixty\r\ncomplete operas arranged for the piano. I looked them through for\r\nsuitable airs for my ‘Suites,’ marked the pages in the volumes with\r\npaper strips, and arranged them into a curious-looking structure round\r\nmy work-table, so that I might have the greatest possible variety of\r\nthe melodious material within my reach. When I was in the midst of this\r\nwork, however, to my great relief and to my poor wife’s consternation,\r\nSchlesinger told me that M. Schlitz, the first cornet player in Paris,\r\nwho had looked my ‘Etudes’ through, preparatory to their being\r\nengraved, had declared that I knew absolutely nothing about the\r\ninstrument, and had generally adopted keys that were too high, which\r\nParisians would never be able to use. The part of the work I had\r\nalready done was, however, accepted, Schlitz having agreed to correct\r\nit, but on condition that I should share my fee with him. The remainder\r\nof the work was then taken off my hands, and the sixty pianoforte\r\narrangements went back to the curious shop in the Rue Richelieu.\r\n\r\nSo my exchequer was again in a sorry plight. The distressing poverty of\r\nmy home grew more apparent every day, and yet I was now free to give a\r\nlast touch to Rienzi, and by the 19th of November I had completed this\r\nmost voluminous of all my operas. I had decided, some time previously,\r\nto offer the first production of this work to the Court Theatre at\r\nDresden, so that, in the event of its being a success, I might thus\r\nresume my connection with Germany. I had decided upon Dresden as I knew\r\nthat there I should have in Tichatschek the most suitable tenor for the\r\nleading part. I also reckoned on my acquaintance with\r\nSchroder-Devrient, who had always been nice to me and who, though her\r\nefforts were ineffectual, had been at great pains, out of regard for my\r\nfamily, to get my Feen introduced at the Court Theatre, Dresden. In the\r\nsecretary of the theatre, Hofrat Winkler (known as Theodor Hell), I\r\nalso had an old friend of my family, besides which I had been\r\nintroduced to the conductor, Reissiger, with whom I and my friend Apel\r\nhad spent a pleasant evening on the occasion of our excursion to\r\nBohemia in earlier days. To all these people I now addressed most\r\nrespectful and eloquent appeals, wrote out an official note to the\r\ndirector, Herr von Lüttichau, as well as a formal petition to the King\r\nof Saxony, and had everything ready to send off.\r\n\r\nMeantime, I had not omitted to indicate the exact tempi in my opera by\r\nmeans of a metronome. As I did not possess such a thing, I had to\r\nborrow one, and one morning I went out to restore the instrument to its\r\nowner, carrying it under my thin overcoat. The day when this occurred\r\nwas one of the strangest in my life, as it showed in a really horrible\r\nway the whole misery of my position at that time. In addition to the\r\nfact that I did not know where to look for the few francs wherewith\r\nMinna was to provide for our scanty household requirements, some of the\r\nbills which, in accordance with the custom in Paris in those days, I\r\nhad signed for the purpose of fitting up our apartments, had fallen\r\ndue. Hoping to get help from one source or another, I first tried to\r\nget those bills prolonged by the holders. As such documents pass\r\nthrough many hands, I had to call on all the holders across the length\r\nand breadth of the city. That day I was to propitiate a cheese-monger\r\nwho occupied a fifth-floor apartment in the Cite. I also intended to\r\nask for help from Heinrich, the brother of my brother-in-law,\r\nBrockhaus, as he was then in Paris; and I was going to call at\r\nSchlesinger’s to raise the money to pay for the despatch of my score\r\nthat day by the usual mail service.\r\n\r\nAs I had also to deliver the metronome, I left Minna early in the\r\nmorning after a sad good-bye. She knew from experience that as I was on\r\na money-raising expedition, she would not see me back till late at\r\nnight. The streets were enveloped in a dense fog, and the first thing I\r\nrecognised on leaving the house was my dog Robber, who had been stolen\r\nfrom us a year before. At first I thought it was a ghost, but I called\r\nout to him sharply in a shrill voice. The animal seemed to recognise\r\nme, and approached me cautiously, but my sudden movement towards him\r\nwith outstretched arms seemed only to revive memories of the few\r\nchastisements I had foolishly inflicted on him during the latter part\r\nof our association, and this memory prevailed over all others. He drew\r\ntimidly away from me and, as I followed him with some eagerness, he\r\nran, only to accelerate his speed when he found he was being pursued. I\r\nbecame more and more convinced that he had recognised me, because he\r\nalways looked back anxiously when he reached a corner; but seeing that\r\nI was hunting him like a maniac, he started off again each time with\r\nrenewed energy. Thus I followed him through a labyrinth of streets,\r\nhardly distinguishable in the thick mist, until I eventually lost sight\r\nof him altogether, never to see him again. It was near the church of\r\nSt. Roch, and I, wet with perspiration and quite breathless, was still\r\nbearing the metronome. For a while I stood motionless, glaring into the\r\nmist, and wondered what the ghostly reappearance of the companion of my\r\ntravelling adventures on this day might portend! The fact that he had\r\nfled from his old master with the terror of a wild beast filled my\r\nheart with a strange bitterness and seemed to me a horrible omen. Sadly\r\nshaken, I set out again, with trembling limbs, upon my weary errand.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Brockhaus told me he could not help me, and I left him. I was\r\nsorely ashamed, but made a strong effort to conceal the painfulness of\r\nmy situation. My other undertakings turned out equally hopeless, and\r\nafter having been kept waiting for hours at Schlesinger’s, listening to\r\nmy employer’s very trivial conversations with his callers—conversations\r\nwhich he seemed purposely to protract—I reappeared under the windows of\r\nmy home long after dark, utterly unsuccessful. I saw Minna looking\r\nanxiously from one of the windows. Half expecting my misfortune she\r\nhad, in the meantime, succeeded in borrowing a small sum of our lodger\r\nand boarder, Brix, the flute-player, whom we tolerated patiently,\r\nthough at some inconvenience to ourselves, as he was a good-natured\r\nfellow. So she was able to offer me at least a comfortable meal.\r\nFurther help was to come to me subsequently, though at the cost of\r\ngreat sacrifices on my part, owing to the success of one of Donizetti’s\r\noperas, La Favorita, a very poor work of the Italian maestro’s, but\r\nwelcomed with great enthusiasm by the Parisian public, already so much\r\ndegenerated. This opera, the success of which was due mainly to two\r\nlively little songs, had been acquired by Schlesinger, who had lost\r\nheavily over Halevy’s last operas.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of my helpless situation, of which he was well aware,\r\nhe rushed into our rooms one morning, beaming all over with amusing\r\ngood-humour, called for pen and ink, and began to work out a\r\ncalculation of the enormous fees which he had arranged for me! He put\r\ndown: ‘La Favorita, complete arrangement for pianoforte, arrangement\r\nwithout words, for solo; ditto, for duet; complete arrangement for\r\nquartette; the same for two violins; ditto for a Cornet a piston. Total\r\nfee, frcs. 1100. Immediate advance in cash, frcs. 500.’ I could see at\r\na glance what an enormous amount of trouble this work would involve,\r\nbut I did not hesitate a moment to undertake it.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, when I brought home these five hundred francs in hard\r\nshining five-franc pieces, and piled them up on the table for our\r\nedification, my sister Cecilia Avenarius happened to drop in to see us.\r\nThe sight of this abundance of wealth seemed to produce a good effect\r\non her, as she had hitherto been rather chary of coming to see us; and\r\nafter that we used to see rather more of her, and were often invited to\r\ndine with them on Sundays. But I no longer cared for any amusements. I\r\nwas so deeply impressed by my past experiences that I made up my mind\r\nto work through this humiliating, albeit profitable task, with untiring\r\nenergy, as though it were a penance imposed on me for the expiation of\r\nmy bygone sins. To save fuel, we limited ourselves to the use of the\r\nbedroom, making it serve as a drawing-room, dining-room, and study, as\r\nwell as dormitory. It was only a step from my bed to my work-table; to\r\nbe seated at the dining-table, all I had to do was to turn my chair\r\nround, and I left my seat altogether only late at night when I wanted\r\nto go to bed again. Every fourth day I allowed myself a short\r\nconstitutional. This penitential process lasted almost all through the\r\nwinter, and sowed the seeds of those gastric disorders which were to be\r\nmore or less of a trouble to me for the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nIn return for the minute and almost interminable work of correcting the\r\nscore of Donizetti’s opera, I managed to get three hundred francs from\r\nSchlesinger, as he could not get any one else to do it. Besides this, I\r\nhad to find the time to copy out the orchestra parts of my overture to\r\nFaust, which I was still hoping to hear at the Conservatoire; and by\r\nthe way of counteracting the depression produced by this humiliating\r\noccupation, I wrote a short story, Eine Pilgerfahrt zu Beethoven (A\r\nPilgrimage to Beethoven), which appeared in the Gazette Musicale, under\r\nthe title Une Visite a Beethoven. Schlesinger told me candidly that\r\nthis little work had created quite a sensation, and had been received\r\nwith very marked approval; and, indeed, it was actually reproduced,\r\neither complete or in parts, in a good many fireside journals.\r\n\r\nHe persuaded me to write some more of the same kind; and in a sequel\r\nentitled Das Ende eines Musikers in Paris (Un Musicien etranger a\r\nParis) I avenged myself for all the misfortunes I had had to endure.\r\nSchlesinger was not quite so pleased with this as with my first effort,\r\nbut it received touching signs of approval from his poor assistant;\r\nwhile Heinrich Heine praised it by saying that ‘Hoffmann would have\r\nbeen incapable of writing such a thing.’ Even Berlioz was touched by\r\nit, and spoke of the story very favourably in one of his articles in\r\nthe Journal des Debats. He also gave me signs of his sympathy, though\r\nonly during a conversation, after the appearance of another of my\r\nmusical articles entitled Ueber die Ouverture (Concerning Overtures),\r\nmainly because I had illustrated my principle by pointing to Gluck’s\r\noverture to Iphigenia in Aulis as a model for compositions of this\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by these signs of sympathy, I felt anxious to become more\r\nintimately acquainted with Berlioz. I had been introduced to him some\r\ntime previously at Schlesinger’s office, where we used to meet\r\noccasionally. I had presented him with a copy of my Two Grenadiers, but\r\ncould, however, never learn any more from him concerning what he really\r\nthought of it than the fact that as he could only strum a little on the\r\nguitar, he was unable to play the music of my composition to himself on\r\nthe piano. During the previous winter I had often heard his grand\r\ninstrumental pieces played under his own direction, and had been most\r\nfavourably impressed by them. During that winter (1839-40) he conducted\r\nthree performances of his new symphony, Romeo and Juliet, at one of\r\nwhich I was present.\r\n\r\nAll this, to be sure, was quite a new world to me, and I was desirous\r\nof gaining some unprejudiced knowledge of it. At first the grandeur and\r\nmasterly execution of the orchestral part almost overwhelmed me. It was\r\nbeyond anything I could have conceived. The fantastic daring, the sharp\r\nprecision with which the boldest combinations—almost tangible in their\r\nclearness—impressed me, drove back my own ideas of the poetry of music\r\nwith brutal violence into the very depths of my soul. I was simply all\r\nears for things of which till then I had never dreamt, and which I felt\r\nI must try to realise. True, I found a great deal that was empty and\r\nshallow in his Romeo and Juliet, a work that lost much by its length\r\nand form of combination; and this was the more painful to me seeing\r\nthat, on the other hand, I felt overpowered by many really bewitching\r\npassages which quite overcame any objections on my part.\r\n\r\nDuring the same winter Berlioz produced his Sinfonie Fantastique and\r\nhis Harald (‘Harold en Italie’). I was also much impressed by these\r\nworks; the musical genre-pictures woven into the first-named symphony\r\nwere particularly pleasing, while Harald delighted me in almost every\r\nrespect..\r\n\r\nIt was, however, the latest work of this wonderful master, his\r\nTrauer-Symphonie fur die Opfer der Juli-Revolution (Grande Symphonie\r\nFunebre et Triomphale), most skilfully composed for massed military\r\nbands during the summer of 1840 for the anniversary of the obsequies of\r\nthe July heroes, and conducted by him under the column of the Place de\r\nla Bastille, which had at last thoroughly convinced me of the greatness\r\nand enterprise of this incomparable artist. But while admiring this\r\ngenius, absolutely unique in his methods, I could never quite shake off\r\na certain peculiar feeling of anxiety. His works left me with a\r\nsensation as of something strange, something with which I felt I should\r\nnever be able to be familiar, and I was often puzzled at the strange\r\nfact that, though ravished by his compositions, I was at the same time\r\nrepelled and even wearied by them. It was only much later that I\r\nsucceeded in clearly grasping and solving this problem, which for years\r\nexercised such a painful spell over me.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that at that time I felt almost like a little school-boy\r\nby the side of Berlioz. Consequently I was really embarrassed when\r\nSchlesinger, determined to make good use of the success of my short\r\nstory, told me he was anxious to produce some of my orchestral\r\ncompositions at a concert arranged by the editor of the Gazette\r\nMusicale. I realised that none of my available works would in any way\r\nbe suitable for such an occasion. I was not quite confident as to my\r\nFaust Overture because of its zephyr-like ending, which I presumed\r\ncould only be appreciated by an audience already familiar with my\r\nmethods. When, moreover, I learned that I should have only a\r\nsecond-rate orchestra—the Valentino from the Casino, Rue St.\r\nHonore—and, moreover, that there could be only one rehearsal, my only\r\nalternative lay between declining altogether, or making another trial\r\nwith my Columbus Overture, the work composed in my early days at\r\nMagdeburg. I adopted the latter course.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to fetch the score of this composition from Ilabeneck, who\r\nhad it stored among the archives of the Conservatoire, he warned me\r\nsomewhat dryly, though not without kindness, of the danger of\r\npresenting this work to the Parisian public, as, to use his own words,\r\nit was too ‘vague.’ One great objection was the difficulty of finding\r\ncapable musicians for the six cornets required, as the music for this\r\ninstrument, so skilfully played in Germany, could hardly, if ever, be\r\nsatisfactorily executed in Paris. Herr Schlitz, the corrector of my\r\n‘Suites’ for Cornet a piston, offered his assistance. I was compelled\r\nto reduce my six cornets to four, and he told me that only two of these\r\ncould be relied on.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the attempts made at the rehearsal to produce\r\nthose very passages on which the effect of my work chiefly depended\r\nwere very discouraging. Not once were the soft high notes played but\r\nthey were flat or altogether wrong. In addition to this, as I was not\r\ngoing to be allowed to conduct the work myself, I had to rely upon a\r\nconductor who, as I was well aware, had fully convinced himself that my\r\ncomposition was the most utter rubbish—an opinion that seemed to be\r\nshared by the whole orchestra. Berlioz, who was present at the\r\nrehearsal, remained silent throughout. He gave me no encouragement,\r\nthough he did not dissuade me. He merely said afterwards, with a weary\r\nsmile, ‘that it was very difficult to get on in Paris.’\r\n\r\nOn the night of the performance (4th February 1841) the audience, which\r\nwas largely composed of subscribers to the Gazette Musicale, and to\r\nwhom, therefore, my literary successes were not unknown, seemed rather\r\nfavourably disposed towards me. I was told later on that my overture,\r\nhowever wearisome it had been, would certainly have been applauded if\r\nthose unfortunate cornet players, by continually failing to produce the\r\neffective passages, had not excited the public almost to the point of\r\nhostility; for Parisians, for the most part, care only for the skilful\r\nparts of performances, as, for instance, for the faultless production\r\nof difficult tones. I was clearly conscious of my complete failure.\r\nAfter this misfortune Paris no longer existed for me, and all I had to\r\ndo was to go back to my miserable bedroom and resume my work of\r\narranging Donizetti’s operas.\r\n\r\nSo great was my renunciation of the world that, like a penitent, I no\r\nlonger shaved, and to my wife’s annoyance, for the first and only time\r\nin my life allowed my beard to grow quite long. I tried to bear\r\neverything patiently, and the only thing that threatened really to\r\ndrive me to despair was a pianist in the room adjoining ours who during\r\nthe livelong day practised Liszt’s fantasy on Lucia di Lammermoor. I\r\nhad to put a stop to this torture, so, to give him an idea of what he\r\nmade us endure, one day I moved our own piano, which was terribly out\r\nof tune, close up to the party wall. Then Brix with his piccolo-flute\r\nplayed the piano-and-violin (or flute) arrangement of the Favorita\r\nOverture I had just completed, while I accompanied him on the piano.\r\nThe effect on our neighbour, a young piano-teacher, must have been\r\nappalling. The concierge told me the next day that the poor fellow was\r\nleaving, and, after all, I felt rather sorry.\r\n\r\nThe wife of our concierge had entered into a sort of arrangement with\r\nus. At first we had occasionally availed ourselves of her services,\r\nespecially in the kitchen, also for brushing clothes, cleaning boots,\r\nand so on; but even the slight outlay that this involved was eventually\r\ntoo heavy for us, and after having dispensed with her services, Minna\r\nhad to suffer the humiliation of doing the whole work of the household,\r\neven the most menial part of it, herself. As we did not like to mention\r\nthis to Brix, Minna was obliged, not only to do all the cooking and\r\nwashing up, but even to clean our lodger’s boots as well. What we felt\r\nmost, however, was the thought of what the concierge and his wife would\r\nthink of us; but we were mistaken, for they only respected us the more,\r\nthough of course we could not avoid a little familiarity at times, Now\r\nand then, therefore, the man would have a chat with me on politics.\r\nWhen the Quadruple Alliance against France had been concluded, and the\r\nsituation under Thiers’ ministry was regarded as very critical, my\r\nconcierge tried to reassure me one day by saying: ‘Monsieur, il y a\r\nquatre hommes en Europe qui s’appellent: le roi Louis Philippe,\r\nl’empereur d’Autriche, l’empereur de Russie, le roi de Prusse; eh bien,\r\nces quatre sont des c…; et nous n’aurons pas la guerre.’\r\n\r\nOf an evening I very seldom lacked entertainment; but the few faithful\r\nfriends who came to see me had to put up with my going on scribbling\r\nmusic till late in the night. Once they prepared a touching surprise\r\nfor me in the form of a little party which they arranged for New Year’s\r\nEve (1840). Lehrs arrived at dusk, rang the bell, and brought a leg of\r\nveal; Kietz brought some rum, sugar, and a lemon; Pecht supplied a\r\ngoose; and Anders two bottles of the champagne with which he had been\r\npresented by a musical instrument-maker in return for a flattering\r\narticle he had written about his pianos. Bottles from that stock were\r\nproduced only on very great occasions. I soon threw the confounded\r\nFavorita aside, therefore, and entered enthusiastically into the fun.\r\n\r\nWe all had to assist in the preparations, to light the fire in the\r\nsalon, give a hand to my wife in the kitchen, and get what was wanted\r\nfrom the grocer. The supper developed into a dithyrambic orgy. When the\r\nchampagne was drunk, and the punch began to produce its effects, I\r\ndelivered a fiery speech which so provoked the hilarity of the company\r\nthat it seemed as though it would never end. I became so excited that I\r\nfirst mounted a chair, and then, by way of heightening the effect, at\r\nlast stood on the table, thence to preach the maddest gospel of the\r\ncontempt of life together with a eulogy on the South American Free\r\nStates. My charmed listeners eventually broke into such fits of sobs\r\nand laughter, and were so overcome, that we had to give them all\r\nshelter for the night—their condition making it impossible for them to\r\nreach their own homes in safety. On New Year’s Day (1841) I was again\r\nbusy with my Favorita.\r\n\r\nI remember another similar though far less boisterous feast, on the\r\noccasion of a visit paid us by the famous violinist Vieux-temps, an old\r\nschoolfellow of Kietz’s. We had the great pleasure of hearing the young\r\nvirtuoso, who was then greatly feted in Paris, play to us charmingly\r\nfor a whole evening—a performance which lent my little salon an unusual\r\ntouch of ‘fashion.’ Kietz rewarded him for his kindness by carrying him\r\non his shoulders to his hotel close by.\r\n\r\nWe were hard hit in the early part of this year by a mistake I made\r\nowing to my ignorance of Paris customs. It seemed to us quite a matter\r\nof course that we should wait until the proper quarter-day to give\r\nnotice to our landlady. So I called on the proprietress of the house, a\r\nrich young widow living in one of her own houses in the Marias quarter.\r\nShe received me, but seemed much embarrassed, and said she would speak\r\nto her agent about the matter, and eventually referred me to him. The\r\nnext day I was informed by letter that my notice would have been valid\r\nhad it been given two days earlier. By this omission I had rendered\r\nmyself liable, according to the agreement, for another year’s rent.\r\nHorrified by this news, I went to see the agent himself, and after\r\nhaving been kept waiting for a long time—as a matter of fact they would\r\nnot let me in at all—I found an elderly gentleman, apparently crippled\r\nby some very painful malady, lying motionless before me. I frankly told\r\nhim my position, and begged him most earnestly to release me from my\r\nagreement, but I was merely told that the fault was mine, and not his,\r\nthat I had given notice a day too late, and consequently that I must\r\nfind the rent for the next year. My concierge, to whom, with some\r\nemotion, I related the story of this occurrence, tried to soothe me by\r\nsaying: ‘J’aurais pu vous dire cela, car voyez, monsieur, cet homme ne\r\nvaut pas l’eau qu’il boit.’\r\n\r\nThis entirely unforeseen misfortune destroyed our last hopes of getting\r\nout of our disastrous position. We consoled ourselves for awhile with\r\nthe hope of finding another lodger, but the fates were once more\r\nagainst us. Easter came, the new term began, and our prospects were as\r\nhopeless as ever. At last our concierge recommended us to a family who\r\nwere willing to take the whole of our apartment, furniture included,\r\noff our hands for a few months. We gladly accepted this offer; for, at\r\nany rate, it ensured the payment of the rent for the ensuing quarter.\r\nWe thought if only we could get away from this unfortunate place we\r\nshould find some way of getting rid of it altogether. We therefore\r\ndecided to find a cheap summer residence for ourselves in the outskirts\r\nof Paris.\r\n\r\nMeudon had been mentioned to us as an inexpensive summer resort, and we\r\nselected an apartment in the avenue which joins Meudon to the\r\nneighbouring village of Bellevue. We left full authority with our\r\nconcierge as to our rooms in Rue du Helder, and settled down in our new\r\ntemporary abode as well as we could. Old Brix, the good-natured\r\nflutist, had to stay with us again, for, owing to the fact that his\r\nusual receipts had been delayed, he would have been in great straits\r\nhad we refused to give him shelter. The removal of our scanty\r\npossessions took place on the 29th of April, and was, after all, no\r\nmore than a flight from the impossible into the unknown, for how we\r\nwere going to live during the following summer we had not the faintest\r\nidea. Schlesinger had no work for me, and no other sources were\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThe only help we could hope for seemed to lie in journalistic work\r\nwhich, though rather unremunerative, had indeed given me the\r\nopportunity of making a little success. During the previous winter I\r\nhad written a long article on Weber’s Freischutz for the Gazette\r\nMusicale. This was intended to prepare the way for the forthcoming\r\nfirst performance of this opera, after recitatives from the pen of\r\nBerlioz had been added to it. The latter was apparently far from\r\npleased at my article. In the article I could not help referring to\r\nBerlioz’s absurd idea of polishing up this old-fashioned musical work\r\nby adding ingredients that spoiled its original characteristics, merely\r\nin order to give it an appearance suited to the luxurious repertoire of\r\nOpera House. The fact that the result fully justified my forecasts did\r\nnot in the least tend to diminish the ill-feeling I had roused among\r\nall those concerned in the production; but I had the satisfaction of\r\nhearing that the famous George Sand had noticed my article. She\r\ncommenced the introduction to a legendary story of French provincial\r\nlife by repudiating certain doubts as to the ability of the French\r\npeople to understand the mystic, fabulous element which, as I had\r\nshown, was displayed in such a masterly manner in Freischutz, and she\r\npointed to my article as clearly explaining the characteristics of that\r\nopera.\r\n\r\nAnother journalistic opportunity arose out of my endeavours to secure\r\nthe acceptance of my Rienzi by the Court Theatre at Dresden. Herr\r\nWinkler, the secretary of that theatre, whom I have already mentioned,\r\nregularly reported progress; but as editor of the Abendzeitung, a paper\r\nthen rather on the wane, he seized the opportunity presented by our\r\nnegotiations in order to ask me to send him frequent and gratuitous\r\ncontributions. The consequence was, that whenever I wanted to know\r\nanything concerning the fate of my opera, I had to oblige him by\r\nenclosing an article for his paper. Now, as these negotiations with the\r\nCourt Theatre lasted a very long time, and involved a large number of\r\ncontributions from me, I often got into the most extraordinary fixes\r\nsimply owing to the fact that I was now once more a prisoner in my\r\nroom, and had been so for some time, and therefore knew nothing of what\r\nwas going on in Paris.\r\n\r\nI had serious reasons for thus withdrawing from the artistic and social\r\nlife of Paris. My own painful experiences and my disgust at all the\r\nmockery of that kind of life, once so attractive to me and yet so alien\r\nto my education, had quickly driven me away from everything connected\r\nwith it. It is true that the production of the Huguenots, for instance,\r\nwhich I then heard for the first time, dazzled me very much indeed. Its\r\nbeautiful orchestral execution, and the extremely careful and effective\r\nmise en scene, gave me a grand idea of the great possibilities of such\r\nperfect and definite artistic means. But, strange to say, I never felt\r\ninclined to hear the same opera again. I soon became tired of the\r\nextravagant execution of the vocalists, and I often amused my friends\r\nexceedingly by imitating the latest Parisian methods and the vulgar\r\nexaggerations with which the performances teemed. Those composers,\r\nmoreover, who aimed at achieving success by adopting the style which\r\nwas then in vogue, could not help, either, incurring my sarcastic\r\ncriticism. The last shred of esteem which I still tried to retain for\r\nthe ‘first lyrical theatre in the world’ was at last rudely destroyed\r\nwhen I saw how such an empty, altogether un-French work as Donizetti’s\r\nFavorita could secure so long and important a run at this theatre.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time of my stay in Paris I do not think I went to the\r\nopera more than four times. The cold productions at the Opera Comique,\r\nand the degenerate quality of the music produced there, had repelled me\r\nfrom the start; and the same lack of enthusiasm displayed by the\r\nsingers also drove me from Italian opera. The names, often very famous\r\nones, of these artists who sang the same four operas for years could\r\nnot compensate me for the complete absence of sentiment which\r\ncharacterised their performance, so unlike that of Schroder-Devrient,\r\nwhich I so thoroughly enjoyed. I clearly saw that everything was on the\r\ndown grade, and yet I cherished no hope or desire to see this state of\r\ndecline superseded by a period of newer and fresher life. I preferred\r\nthe small theatres, where French talent was shown in its true light;\r\nand yet, as the result of my own longings, I was too intent upon\r\nfinding points of relationship in them which would excite my sympathy,\r\nfor it to be possible for me to realise those peculiar excellences in\r\nthem which did not happen to interest me at all. Besides, from the very\r\nbeginning my own troubles had proved so trying, and the consciousness\r\nof the failure of my Paris schemes had become so cruelly apparent,\r\nthat, either out of indifference or annoyance, I declined all\r\ninvitations to the theatres. Again and again, much to Minna’s regret, I\r\nreturned tickets for performances in which Rachel was to appear at the\r\nTheatre Francais, and, in fact, saw that famous theatre only once,\r\nwhen, some time later, I had to go there on business for my Dresden\r\npatron, who wanted some more articles.\r\n\r\nI adopted the most shameful means for filling the columns of the\r\nAbendzeitung; I just strung together whatever I happened to hear in the\r\nevening from Anders and Lehrs. But as they had no very exciting\r\nadventures either, they simply told me all they had picked up from\r\npapers and table-talk, and this I tried to render with as much piquancy\r\nas possible in accordance with the journalistic style created by Heine,\r\nwhich was all the rage at the time. My one fear was lest old Hofrath\r\nWinkler should some day discover the secret of my wide knowledge of\r\nParis. Among other things which I sent to his declining paper was a\r\nlong account of the production of Freischutz, He was particularly\r\ninterested in it, as he was the guardian of Weber’s children; and when\r\nin one of his letters he assured me that he would not rest until he had\r\ngot the definite assurance that Rienzi had been accepted, I sent him,\r\nwith my most profuse thanks, the German manuscript of my ‘Beethoven’\r\nstory for his paper. The 1841 edition of this gazette, then published\r\nby Arnold, but now no longer in existence, contains the only print of\r\nthis manuscript.\r\n\r\nMy occasional journalistic work was increased by a request from Lewald,\r\nthe editor of Europa, a literary monthly, asking me to write something\r\nfor him. This man was the first who, from time to time, had mentioned\r\nmy name to the public. As he used to publish musical supplements to his\r\nelegant and rather widely read magazine, I sent him two of my\r\ncompositions from Königsberg for publication. One of these was the\r\nmusic I had set to a melancholy poem by Scheuerlin, entitled Der Knabe\r\nund der Tannenbaum (a work of which even to-day I am still proud), and\r\nmy beautiful Carnevals Lied out of Liebesverbot.\r\n\r\nWhen I wanted to publish my little French compositions—Dors, mon\r\nenfant, and the music to Hugo’s Attente and Ronsard’s Mignonne—Lewald\r\nnot only sent me a small fee—the first I had ever received for a\r\ncomposition—but commissioned some long articles on my Paris\r\nimpressions, which he begged me to write as entertainingly as possible.\r\nFor his paper I wrote Pariser Amusements and Pariser Fatalitaten, in\r\nwhich I gave vent in a humorous style, a la Heine, to all my\r\ndisappointing experiences in Paris, and to all my contempt for the life\r\nled by its inhabitants. In the second I described the existence of a\r\ncertain Hermann Pfau, a strange good-for-nothing with whom, during my\r\nearly Leipzig days, I had become more intimately acquainted than was\r\ndesirable. This man had been wandering about Paris like a vagrant ever\r\nsince the beginning of the previous winter, and the meagre income I\r\nderived from arrangements of La Favorita was often partly consumed in\r\nhelping this completely broken-down fellow. So it was only fair that I\r\nshould get back a few francs of the money spent on him in Paris by\r\nturning his adventures to some account in Lewald’s newspapers.\r\n\r\nWhen I came into contact with Leon Pillet, the manager of the Opera, my\r\nliterary work took yet another direction. After numerous inquiries I\r\neventually discovered that he had taken a fancy to my draft of the\r\nFliegender Holländer. He informed me of this, and asked me to sell him\r\nthe plot, as he was under contract to supply various composers with\r\nsubjects for operettas. I tried to explain to Pillet, both verbally and\r\nin writing, that he could hardly expect that the plot would be properly\r\ntreated except by myself, as this draft was in fact my own idea, and\r\nthat it had only come to his knowledge by my having submitted it to\r\nhim. But it was all to no purpose. He was obliged to admit quite\r\nfrankly that the expectations I had cherished as to the result of\r\nMeyerbeer’s recommendation to him would not come to anything. He said\r\nthere was no likelihood of my getting a commission for a composition,\r\neven of a light opera, for the next seven years, as his already\r\nexisting contracts extended over that period. He asked me to be\r\nsensible, and to sell him the draft for a small amount, so that he\r\nmight have the music written by an author to be selected by him; and he\r\nadded that if I still wished to try my luck at the Opera House, I had\r\nbetter see the ‘ballet-master,’ as he might want some music for a\r\ncertain dance. Seeing that I contemptuously refused this proposal, he\r\nleft me to my own devices.\r\n\r\nAfter endless and unsuccessful attempts at getting the matter settled,\r\nI at last begged Edouard Monnaie, the Commissaire for the Royal\r\nTheatres, who was not only a friend of mine, but also editor of the\r\nGazette Musicale, to act as mediator. He candidly confessed that he\r\ncould not understand Pillet’s liking for my plot, which he also was\r\nacquainted with; but as Pillet seemed to like it—though he would\r\nprobably lose it—he advised me to accept anything for it, as Monsieur\r\nPaul Faucher, a brother-in-law of Victor Hugo’s, had had an offer to\r\nwork out the scheme for a similar libretto. This gentleman had,\r\nmoreover, declared that there was nothing new in my plot, as the story\r\nof the Vaisseau Fantome was well known in France. I now saw how I\r\nstood, and, in a conversation with Pillet, at which M. Faucher was\r\npresent, I said I would come to an arrangement. My plot was generously\r\nestimated by Pillet at five hundred francs, and I received that amount\r\nfrom the cash office at the theatre, to be subsequently deducted from\r\nthe author’s rights of the future poet.\r\n\r\nOur summer residence in the Avenue de Meudon now assumed quite a\r\ndefinite character. These five hundred francs had to help me to work\r\nout the words and music of my Fliegender Holländer for Germany, while I\r\nabandoned the French Vaisseau Fantome to its fate.\r\n\r\nThe state of my affairs, which was getting ever worse and worse, was\r\nslightly improved by the settlement of this matter. May and June had\r\ngone by, and during these months our troubles had grown steadily more\r\nserious. The lovely season of the year, the stimulating country air,\r\nand the sensation of freedom following upon my deliverance from the\r\nwretchedly paid musical hack-work I had had to do all the winter,\r\nwrought their beneficial effects on me, and I was inspired to write a\r\nsmall story entitled Ein glucklicher Abend. This was translated and\r\npublished in French in the Gazette Musicale. Soon, however, our lack of\r\nfunds began to make itself felt with a severity that was very\r\ndiscouraging. We felt this all the more keenly when my sister Cecilia\r\nand her husband, following our example, moved to a place quite close to\r\nus. Though not wealthy, they were fairly well-to-do. They came to see\r\nus every day, but we never thought it desirable to let them know how\r\nterribly hard-up we were. One day it came to a climax. Being absolutely\r\nwithout money, I started out, early one morning, to walk to Paris—for I\r\nhad not even enough to pay the railway fare thither—and I resolved to\r\nwander about the whole day, trudging from street to street, even until\r\nlate in the afternoon, in the hope of raising a five-franc piece; but\r\nmy errand proved absolutely vain, and I had to walk all the way back to\r\nMeudon again, utterly penniless.\r\n\r\nWhen I told Minna, who came to meet me, of my failure, she informed me\r\nin despair that Hermann Pfau, whom I have mentioned before, had also\r\ncome to us in the most pitiful plight, and actually in want of food,\r\nand that she had had to give him the last of the bread delivered by the\r\nbaker that morning. The only hope that now remained was that, at any\r\nrate, my lodger Brix, who by a singular fate was now our companion in\r\nmisfortune, would return with some success from the expedition to Paris\r\nwhich he also had made that morning. At last he, too, returned bathed\r\nin perspiration and exhausted, driven home by the craving for a meal,\r\nwhich he had been unable to procure in the town, as he could not find\r\nany of the acquaintances he went to see. He begged most piteously for a\r\npiece of bread. This climax to the situation at last inspired my wife\r\nwith heroic resolution; for she felt it her duty to exert herself to\r\nappease at least the hunger of her menfolk. For the first time during\r\nher stay on French soil, she persuaded the baker, the butcher, and\r\nwine-merchant, by plausible arguments, to supply her with the\r\nnecessaries of life without immediate cash payment, and Minna’s eyes\r\nbeamed when, an hour later, she was able to put before us an excellent\r\nmeal, during which, as it happened, we were surprised by the Avenarius\r\nfamily, who were evidently relieved at finding us so well provided for.\r\n\r\nThis extreme distress was relieved for a time, at the beginning of\r\nJuly, by the sale of my Vaisseau Fantome, which meant my final\r\nrenunciation of my success in Paris. As long as the five hundred francs\r\nlasted, I had an interval of respite for carrying on my work. The first\r\nobject on which I spent my money was on the hire of a piano, a thing of\r\nwhich I had been entirely deprived for months. My chief intention in so\r\ndoing was to revive my faith in myself as a musician, as, ever since\r\nthe autumn of the previous year, I had exercised my talents as a\r\njournalist and adapter of operas only. The libretto of the Fliegender\r\nHolländer, which I had hurriedly written during the recent period of\r\ndistress, aroused considerable interest in Lehrs; he actually declared\r\nI would never write anything better, and that the Fliegender Holländer\r\nwould be my Don Juan; the only thing now was to find the music for it.\r\nAs towards the end of the previous winter I still entertained the hopes\r\nof being permitted to treat this subject for the French Opera, I had\r\nalready finished some of the words and music of the lyric parts, and\r\nhad had the libretto translated by Emile Deschamps, intending it for a\r\ntrial performance, which, alas, never took place. These parts were the\r\nballad of Senta, the song of the Norwegian sailors, and the ‘Spectre\r\nSong’ of the crew of the Fliegender Holländer. Since that time I had\r\nbeen so violently torn away from the music that, when the piano arrived\r\nat my rustic retreat, I did not dare to touch it for a whole day. I was\r\nterribly afraid lest I should discover that my inspiration had left\r\nme—when suddenly I was seized with the idea that I had forgotten to\r\nwrite out the song of the helmsman in the first act, although, as a\r\nmatter of fact, I could not remember having composed it at all, as I\r\nhad in reality only just written the lyrics. I succeeded, and was\r\npleased with the result. The same thing occurred with the ‘Spinner’s\r\nSong,’ and when I had written out these two pieces, and, on further\r\nreflection, could not help admitting that they had really only taken\r\nshape in my mind at that moment, I was quite delirious with joy at the\r\ndiscovery. In seven weeks the whole of the music of the Fliegender\r\nHolländer, except the orchestration, was finished.\r\n\r\nThereupon followed a general revival in our circle; my exuberant good\r\nspirits astonished every one, and my Avenarius relations in particular\r\nthought I must really be prospering, as I was such good company. I\r\nresumed my long walks in the woods of Meudon, frequently even\r\nconsenting to help Minna gather mushrooms, which, unfortunately, were\r\nfor her the chief charm of our woodland retreat, though it filled our\r\nlandlord with terror when he saw us returning with our spoils, as he\r\nfelt sure we should be poisoned if we ate them.\r\n\r\nMy destiny, which almost invariably led me into strange adventures,\r\nhere once more introduced me to the most eccentric character to be\r\nfound not only in the neighbourhood of Meudon, but even in Paris. This\r\nwas M. Jadin, who, though he was old enough to be able to say that he\r\nremembered seeing Madame de Pompadour at Versailles, was still vigorous\r\nbeyond belief. It appeared to be his aim to keep the world in a\r\nconstant state of conjecture as to his real age; he made everything for\r\nhimself with his own hands, including even a quantity of wigs of every\r\nshade, ranging in the most comic variety from youthful flaxen to the\r\nmost venerable white, with intermediate shades of grey; these he wore\r\nalternately, as the fancy pleased him. He dabbled in everything, and I\r\nwas pleased to find he had a particular fancy for painting. The fact\r\nthat all the walls of his rooms were hung with the most childish\r\ncaricatures of animal life, and that he had even embellished the\r\noutside of his blinds with the most ridiculous paintings, did not\r\ndisconcert me in the least; on the contrary, it confirmed my belief\r\nthat he did not dabble in music, until, to my horror, I discovered that\r\nthe strangely discordant sounds of a harp which kept reaching my ears\r\nfrom some unknown region were actually proceeding from his basement,\r\nwhere he had two harpsichords of his own invention. He informed me that\r\nhe had unfortunately neglected playing them for a long time, but that\r\nhe now meant to begin practising again assiduously in order to give me\r\npleasure. I succeeded in dissuading him from this, by assuring him that\r\nthe doctor had forbidden me to listen to the harp, as it was bad for my\r\nnerves. His figure as I saw him for the last time remains impressed on\r\nmy memory, like an apparition from the world of Hoffmann’s fairy-tales.\r\nIn the late autumn, when we were going back to Paris, he asked us to\r\ntake with us on our furniture van an enormous stove-pipe, of which he\r\npromised to relieve us shortly. One very cold day Jadin actually\r\npresented himself at our new abode in Paris, in a most preposterous\r\ncostume of his own manufacture, consisting of very thin light-yellow\r\ntrousers, a very short pale-green dress-coat with conspicuously long\r\ntails, projecting lace shirt frills and cuffs, a very fair wig, and a\r\nhat so small that it was constantly dropping off; he wore in addition a\r\nquantity of imitation jewellery—and all this on the undisguised\r\nassumption that he could not go about in fashionable Paris dressed as\r\nsimply as in the country. He had come for the stove-pipe; we asked him\r\nwhere the men to carry it were; in reply he simply smiled, and\r\nexpressed his surprise at our helplessness; and thereupon took the\r\nenormous stove-pipe under his arm and absolutely refused to accept our\r\nhelp when we offered to assist him in carrying it down the stairs,\r\nthough this operation, notwithstanding his vaunted skill, occupied him\r\nquite half an hour. Every one in the house assembled to witness this\r\nremoval, but he was by no means disconcerted, and managed to get the\r\npipe through the street door, and then tripped gracefully along the\r\npavement with it, and disappeared from our sight.\r\n\r\nFor this short though eventful period, during which I was quite free to\r\ngive full scope to my inmost thoughts, I indulged in the consolation of\r\npurely artistic creations. I can only say that, when it came to an end,\r\nI had made such progress that I could look forward with cheerful\r\ncomposure to the much longer period of trouble and distress I felt was\r\nin store for me. This, in fact, duly set in, for I had only just\r\ncompleted the last scene when I found that my five hundred francs were\r\ncoming to an end, and what was left was not sufficient to secure me the\r\nnecessary peace and freedom from worry for composing the overture; I\r\nhad to postpone this until my luck should take another favourable turn,\r\nand meanwhile I was forced to engage in the struggle for a bare\r\nsubsistence, making efforts of all kinds that left me neither leisure\r\nnor peace of mind. The concierge from the Rue du Helder brought us the\r\nnews that the mysterious family to whom we had let our rooms had left,\r\nand that we were now once more responsible for the rent. I had to tell\r\nhim that I would not under any circumstances trouble about the rooms\r\nany more, and that the landlord might recoup himself by the sale of the\r\nfurniture we had left there. This was done at a very heavy loss, and\r\nthe furniture, the greater part of which was still unpaid for, was\r\nsacrificed to pay the rent of a dwelling which we no longer occupied.\r\n\r\nUnder the stress of the most terrible privations I still endeavoured to\r\nsecure sufficient leisure for working out the orchestration of the\r\nscore of the Fliegender Holländer. The rough autumn weather set in at\r\nan exceptionally early date; people were all leaving their country\r\nhouses for Paris, and, among them, the Avenarius family. We, however,\r\ncould not dream of doing so, for we could not even raise the funds for\r\nthe journey. When M. Jadin expressed his surprise at this, I pretended\r\nto be so pressed with work that I could not interrupt it, although I\r\nfelt the cold that penetrated through the thin walls of the house very\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\nSo I waited for help from Ernst Castel, one of my old Königsberg\r\nfriends, a well-to-do young merchant, who a short time before had\r\ncalled on us in Meudon and treated us to a luxurious repast in Paris,\r\npromising at the same time to relieve our necessities as soon as\r\npossible by an advance, which we knew was an easy matter to him.\r\n\r\nBy way of cheering us up, Kietz came over to us one day, with a large\r\nportfolio and a pillow under his arm; he intended to amuse us by\r\nworking at a large caricature representing myself and my unfortunate\r\nadventures in Paris, and the pillow was to enable him, after his\r\nlabours, to get some rest on our hard couch, which he had noticed had\r\nno pillows at the head. Knowing that we had a difficulty in procuring\r\nfuel, he brought with him some bottles of rum, to ‘warm’ us with punch\r\nduring the cold evenings; under these circumstances I read Hoffmann’s\r\nTales to him and my wife.\r\n\r\nAt last I had news from Königsberg, but it only opened my eyes to the\r\nfact that the gay young dog had not meant his promise seriously. We now\r\nlooked forward almost with despair to the chilly mists of approaching\r\nwinter, but Kietz, declaring that it was his place to find help, packed\r\nup his portfolio, placed it under his arm with the pillow, and went off\r\nto Paris. On the next day he returned with two hundred francs, that he\r\nhad managed to procure by means of generous self-sacrifice. We at once\r\nset off for Paris, and took a small apartment near our friends, in the\r\nback part of No. 14 Rue Jacob. I afterwards heard that shortly after we\r\nleft it was occupied by Proudhon.\r\n\r\nWe got back to town on 30th October. Our home was exceedingly small and\r\ncold, and its chilliness in particular made it very bad for our health.\r\nWe furnished it scantily with the little we had saved from the wreck of\r\nthe Rue du Holder, and awaited the results of my efforts towards\r\ngetting my works accepted and produced in Germany. The first necessity\r\nwas at all costs to secure peace and quietness for myself for the short\r\ntime which I should have to devote to the overture of the Fliegender\r\nHolländer; I told Kietz that he would have to procure the money\r\nnecessary for my household expenses until this work was finished and\r\nthe full score of the opera sent off. With the aid of a pedantic uncle,\r\nwho had lived in Paris a long time and who was also a painter, he\r\nsucceeded in providing me with the necessary assistance, in instalments\r\nof five or ten francs at a time. During this period I often pointed\r\nwith cheerful pride to my boots, which became mere travesties of\r\nfootgear, as the soles eventually disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nAs long as I was engaged on the Dutchman, and Kietz was looking after\r\nme, this made no difference, for I never went out: but when I had\r\ndespatched my completed score to the management of the Berlin Court\r\nTheatre at the beginning of December, the bitterness of the position\r\ncould no longer be disguised. It was necessary for me to buckle to and\r\nlook for help myself.\r\n\r\nWhat this meant in Paris I learned just about this time from the\r\nhapless fate of the worthy Lehrs. Driven by need such as I myself had\r\nhad to surmount a year before at about the same time, he had been\r\ncompelled on a broiling hot day in the previous summer to scour the\r\nvarious quarters of the city breathlessly, to get grace for bills he\r\nhad accepted, and which had fallen due. He foolishly took an iced\r\ndrink, which he hoped would refresh him in his distressing condition,\r\nbut it immediately made him lose his voice, and from that day he was\r\nthe victim of a hoarseness which with terrific rapidity ripened the\r\nseeds of consumption, doubtless latent in him, and developed that\r\nincurable disease. For months he had been growing weaker and weaker,\r\nfilling us at last with the gloomiest anxiety: he alone believed the\r\nsupposed chill would be cured, if he could heat his room better for a\r\ntime. One day I sought him out in his lodging, where I found him in the\r\nicy-cold room, huddled up at his writing-table, and complaining of the\r\ndifficulty of his work for Didot, which was all the more distressing as\r\nhis employer was pressing him for advances he had made.\r\n\r\nHe declared that if he had not had the consolation in those doleful\r\nhours of knowing that I had, at any rate, got my Dutchman finished, and\r\nthat a prospect of success was thus opened to the little circle of\r\nfriends, his misery would have been hard indeed to bear. Despite my own\r\ngreat trouble, I begged him to share our fire and work in my room. He\r\nsmiled at my courage in trying to help others, especially as my\r\nquarters offered barely space enough for myself and my wife. However,\r\none evening he came to us and silently showed me a letter he had\r\nreceived from Villemain, the Minister of Education at that time, in\r\nwhich the latter expressed in the warmest terms his great regret at\r\nhaving only just learned that so distinguished a scholar, whose able\r\nand extensive collaboration in Didot’s issue of the Greek classics had\r\nmade him participator in a work that was the glory of the nation,\r\nshould be in such bad health and straitened circumstances.\r\nUnfortunately, the amount of public money which he had at his disposal\r\nat that moment for subsidising literature only allowed of his offering\r\nhim the sum of five hundred francs, which he enclosed with apologies,\r\nasking him to accept it as a recognition of his merits on the part of\r\nthe French Government, and adding that it was his intention to give\r\nearnest consideration as to how he might materially improve his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThis filled us with the utmost thankfulness on poor Lehrs’ account, and\r\nwe looked on the incident almost as a miracle. We could not help\r\nassuming, however, that M. Villemain had been influenced by Didot, who\r\nhad been prompted by his own guilty conscience for his despicable\r\nexploitation of Lehrs, and by the prospect of thus relieving himself of\r\nthe responsibility of helping him. At the same time, from similar cases\r\nwithin our knowledge, which were fully confirmed by my own subsequent\r\nexperience, we were driven to the conclusion that such prompt and\r\nconsiderate sympathy on the part of a minister would have been\r\nimpossible in Germany. Lehrs would now have a fire to work by, but\r\nalas! our fears as to his declining health could not be allayed. When\r\nwe left Paris in the following spring, it was the certainty that we\r\nshould never see our dear friend again that made our parting so\r\npainful.\r\n\r\nIn my own great distress I was again exposed to the annoyance of having\r\nto write numerous unpaid articles for the Abendzeitung, as my patron,\r\nHofrath Winkler, was still unable to give me any satisfactory account\r\nof the fate of my Rienzi in Dresden. In these circumstances I was\r\nobliged to consider it a good thing that Halevy’s latest opera was at\r\nlast a success. Schlesinger came to us radiant with joy at the success\r\nof La Reine de Chypre, and promised me eternal bliss for the piano\r\nscore and various other arrangements I had made of this newest rage in\r\nthe sphere of opera. So I was again forced to pay the penalty for\r\ncomposing my own Fliegender Holländer by having to sit down and write\r\nout arrangements of Halevy’s opera. Yet this task no longer weighed on\r\nme so heavily. Apart from the wellfounded hope of being at last\r\nrecalled from my exile in Paris, and thus being able, as I thought, to\r\nregard this last struggle with poverty as the decisive one, the\r\narrangement of Halevy’s score was far and away a more interesting piece\r\nof hack-work than the shameful labour I had spent on Donizetti’s\r\nFavorita.\r\n\r\nI paid another visit, the last for a long time to come, to the Grand\r\nOpera to hear this Reine de Chypre. There was, indeed, much for me to\r\nsmile at. My eyes were no longer shut to the extreme weakness of this\r\nclass of work, and the caricature of it that was often produced by the\r\nmethod of rendering it. I was sincerely rejoiced to see the better side\r\nof Halevy again. I had taken a great fancy to him from the time of his\r\nLa Juive, and had a very high opinion of his masterly talent.\r\n\r\nAt the request of Schlesinger I also willingly consented to write for\r\nhis paper a long article on Halevy’s latest work. In it I laid\r\nparticular stress on my hope that the French school might not again\r\nallow the benefits obtained by studying the German style to be lost by\r\nrelapsing into the shallowest Italian methods. On that occasion I\r\nventured, by way of encouraging the French school, to point to the\r\npeculiar significance of Auber, and particularly to his Stumme von\r\nPortici, drawing attention, on the other hand, to the overloaded\r\nmelodies of Rossini, which often resembled sol-fa exercises. In reading\r\nover the proof of my article I saw that this passage about Rossini had\r\nbeen left out, and M. Edouard Monnaie admitted to me that, in his\r\ncapacity as editor of a musical paper, he had felt himself bound to\r\nsuppress it. He considered that if I had any adverse criticism to pass\r\non the composer, I could easily get it published in any other kind of\r\npaper, but not in one devoted to the interests of music, simply because\r\nsuch a passage could not be printed there without seeming absurd. It\r\nalso annoyed him that I had spoken in such high terms of Auber, but he\r\nlet it stand. I had to listen to much from that quarter which\r\nenlightened me for ever with regard to the decay of operatic music in\r\nparticular, and artistic taste in general, among Frenchmen of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nI also wrote a longer article on the same opera for my precious friend\r\nWinkler at Dresden, who was still hesitating about accepting my Rienzi.\r\nIn doing so I intentionally made merry over a mishap that had befallen\r\nLachner the conductor. Küstner, who was theatrical director at Munich\r\nat the time, with a view to giving his friend another chance, ordered a\r\nlibretto to be written for him by St. Georges in Paris, so that,\r\nthrough his paternal care, the highest bliss which a German composer\r\ncould dream of might be assured to his protege. Well, it turned out\r\nthat when Halevy’s Reine de Chypre appeared, it treated the same\r\nsubject as Lachner’s presumably original work, which had been composed\r\nin the meantime. It mattered very little that the libretto was a really\r\ngood one, the value of the bargain lay in the fact that it was to be\r\nglorified by Lachner’s music. It appeared, however, that St. Georges\r\nhad, as a matter of fact, to some extent altered the book sent to\r\nMunich, but only by the omission of several interesting features. The\r\nfury of the Munich manager was great, whereupon St. Georges declared\r\nhis astonishment that the latter could have imagined he would supply a\r\nlibretto intended solely for the German stage at the paltry price\r\noffered by his German customer. As I had formed my own private opinion\r\nas to procuring French librettos for operas, and as nothing in the\r\nworld would have induced me to set to music even the most effective\r\npiece of writing by Scribe or St. Georges, this occurrence delighted me\r\nimmensely, and in the best of spirits I let myself go on the point for\r\nthe benefit of the readers of the Abendzeitung, who, it is to be hoped,\r\ndid not include my future ‘friend’ Lachner.\r\n\r\nIn addition, my work on Halevy’s opera (Reine de Chypre) brought me\r\ninto closer contact with that composer, and was the means of procuring\r\nme many an enlivening talk with that peculiarly good-hearted and really\r\nunassuming man, whose talent, alas, declined all too soon. Schlesinger,\r\nin fact, was exasperated at his incorrigible laziness. Halevy, who had\r\nlooked through my piano score, contemplated several changes with a view\r\nto making it easier, but he did not proceed with them: Schlesinger\r\ncould not get the proof-sheets back; the publication was consequently\r\ndelayed, and he feared that the popularity of the opera would be over\r\nbefore the work was ready for the public. He urged me to get firm hold\r\nof Halevy very early in the morning in his rooms, and compel him to set\r\nto work at the alterations in my company.\r\n\r\nThe first time I reached his house at about ten in the morning, I found\r\nhim just out of bed, and he informed me that he really must have\r\nbreakfast first. I accepted his invitation, and sat down with him to a\r\nsomewhat luxurious meal; my conversation seemed to appeal to him, but\r\nfriends came in, and at last Schlesinger among the number, who burst\r\ninto a fury at not finding him at work on the proofs he regarded as so\r\nimportant. Halevy, however, remained quite unmoved. In the best of good\r\ntempers he merely complained of his latest success, because he had\r\nnever had more peace than of late, when his operas, almost without\r\nexception, had been failures, and he had not had anything to do with\r\nthem after the first production. Moreover, he feigned not to understand\r\nwhy this Reine de Chypre in particular should have been a success; he\r\ndeclared that Schlesinger had engineered it on purpose to worry him.\r\nWhen he spoke a few words to me in German, one of the visitors was\r\nastonished, whereupon Schlesinger said that all Jews could speak\r\nGerman. Thereupon Schlesinger was asked if he also was a Jew. He\r\nanswered that he had been, but had become a Christian for his wife’s\r\nsake. This freedom of speech was a pleasant surprise to me, because in\r\nGermany in such cases we always studiously avoided the point, as\r\ndiscourteous to the person referred to. But as we never got to the\r\nproof correcting, Schlesinger made me promise to give Halevy no peace\r\nuntil we had done them.\r\n\r\nThe secret of his indifference to success became clear to me in the\r\ncourse of further conversation, as I learned that he was on the point\r\nof making a wealthy marriage. At first I was inclined to think that\r\nHalevy was simply a man whose youthful talent was only stimulated to\r\nachieve one great success with the object of becoming rich; in his\r\ncase, however, this was not the only reason, as he was very modest in\r\nregard to his own capacity, and had no great opinion of the works of\r\nthose more fortunate composers who were writing for the French stage at\r\nthat time. In him I thus, for the first time, met with the frankly\r\nexpressed admission of disbelief in the value of all our modern\r\ncreations in this dubious field of art. I have since come to the\r\nconclusion that this incredulity, often expressed with much less\r\nmodesty, justifies the participation of all Jews in our artistic\r\nconcerns. Only once did Halevy speak to me with real candour, when, on\r\nmy tardy departure for Germany, he wished me the success he thought my\r\nworks deserved.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1860 I saw him again. I had learned that, while the\r\nParisian critics were giving vent to the bitterest condemnation of the\r\nconcerts I was giving at that time, he had expressed his approval, and\r\nthis determined me to visit him at the Palais de l’Institut, of which\r\nhe had for some time been permanent secretary. He seemed particularly\r\neager to learn from my own lips what my new theory about music really\r\nwas, of which he had heard such wild rumours. For his own part, he\r\nsaid, he had never found anything but music in my music, but with this\r\ndifference, that mine had generally seemed very good. This gave rise to\r\na lively discussion on my part, to which he good-humouredly agreed,\r\nonce more wishing me success in Paris. This time, however, he did so\r\nwith less conviction than when he bade me good-bye for Germany, which I\r\nthought was because he doubted whether I could succeed in Paris. From\r\nthis final visit I carried away a depressing sense of the enervation,\r\nboth moral and aesthetic, which had overcome one of the last great\r\nFrench musicians, while, on the other hand, I could not help feeling\r\nthat a tendency to a hypocritical or frankly impudent exploitation of\r\nthe universal degeneracy marked all who could be designated as Halevy’s\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nThroughout this period of constant hack-work my thoughts were entirely\r\nbent on my return to Germany, which now presented itself to my mind in\r\na wholly new and ideal light. I endeavoured in various ways to secure\r\nall that seemed most attractive about the project, or which filled my\r\nsoul with longing. My intercourse with Lehrs had, on the whole, given a\r\ndecided spur to my former tendency to grapple seriously with my\r\nsubjects, a tendency which had been counteracted by closer contact with\r\nthe theatre. This desire now furnished a basis for closer study of\r\nphilosophical questions. I had been astonished at times to hear even\r\nthe grave and virtuous Lehrs, openly and quite as a matter of course,\r\ngive expression to grave doubts concerning our individual survival\r\nafter death. He declared that in many great men this doubt, even though\r\nonly tacitly held, had been the real incitement to noble deeds. The\r\nnatural result of such a belief speedily dawned on me without, however,\r\ncausing me any serious alarm. On the contrary, I found a fascinating\r\nstimulus in the fact that boundless regions of meditation and knowledge\r\nwere thereby opened up which hitherto I had merely skimmed in\r\nlight-hearted levity.\r\n\r\nIn my renewed attempts to study the Greek classics in the original, I\r\nreceived no encouragement from Lehrs. He dissuaded me from doing so\r\nwith the well-meant consolation, that as I could only be born once, and\r\nthat with music in me, I should learn to understand this branch of\r\nknowledge without the help of grammar or lexicon; whereas if Greek were\r\nto be studied with real enjoyment, it was no joke, and would not suffer\r\nbeing relegated to a secondary place.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I felt strongly drawn to gain a closer acquaintance\r\nof German history than I had secured at school. I had Raumer’s History\r\nof the Hohenstaufen within easy reach to start upon. All the great\r\nfigures in this book lived vividly before my eyes. I was particularly\r\ncaptivated by the personality of that gifted Emperor Frederick II.,\r\nwhose fortunes aroused my sympathy so keenly that I vainly sought for a\r\nfitting artistic setting for them. The fate of his son Manfred, on the\r\nother hand, provoked in me an equally well-grounded, but more easily\r\ncombated, feeling of opposition.\r\n\r\nI accordingly made a plan of a great five-act dramatic poem, which\r\nshould also be perfectly adapted to a musical setting. My impulse to\r\nembellish the story with the central figure of romantic significance\r\nwas prompted by the fact of Manfred’s enthusiastic reception in Luceria\r\nby the Saracens, who supported him and carried him on from victory to\r\nvictory till he reached his final triumph, and this, too, in spite of\r\nthe fact that he had come to them betrayed on every hand, banned by the\r\nChurch, and deserted by all his followers during his flight through\r\nApulia and the Abruzzi.\r\n\r\nEven at this time it delighted me to find in the German mind the\r\ncapacity of appreciating beyond the narrow bounds of nationality all\r\npurely human qualities, in however strange a garb they might be\r\npresented. For in this I recognised how nearly akin it is to the mind\r\nof Greece. In Frederick II. I saw this quality in full flower. A\r\nfair-haired German of ancient Swabian stock, heir to the Norman realm\r\nof Sicily and Naples, who gave the Italian language its first\r\ndevelopment, and laid a basis for the evolution of knowledge and art\r\nwhere hitherto ecclesiastical fanaticism and feudal brutality had alone\r\ncontended for power, a monarch who gathered at his court the poets and\r\nsages of eastern lands, and surrounded himself with the living products\r\nof Arabian and Persian grace and spirit—this man I beheld betrayed by\r\nthe Roman clergy to the infidel foe, yet ending his crusade, to their\r\nbitter disappointment, by a pact of peace with the Sultan, from whom he\r\nobtained a grant of privileges to Christians in Palestine such as the\r\nbloodiest victory could scarcely have secured.\r\n\r\nIn this wonderful Emperor, who finally, under the ban of that same\r\nChurch, struggled hopelessly and in vain against the savage bigotry of\r\nhis age, I beheld the German ideal in its highest embodiment. My poem\r\nwas concerned with the fate of his favourite son Manfred. On the death\r\nof an elder brother, Frederick’s empire had entirely fallen to pieces,\r\nand the young Manfred was left, under papal suzerainty, in nominal\r\npossession of the throne of Apulia. We find him at Capua, in\r\nsurroundings, and attended by a court, in which the spirit of his great\r\nfather survives, in a state of almost effeminate degeneration. In\r\ndespair of ever restoring the imperial power of the Hohenstaufen, he\r\nseeks to forget his sadness in romance and song. There now appears upon\r\nthe scene a young Saracen lady, just arrived from the East, who, by\r\nappealing to the alliance between East and West concluded by Manfred’s\r\nnoble father, conjures the desponding son to maintain his imperial\r\nheritage. She acts the part of an inspired prophetess, and though the\r\nprince is quickly filled with love for her, she succeeds in keeping him\r\nat a respectful distance. By a skilfully contrived flight she snatches\r\nhim, not only from the pursuit of rebellious Apulian nobles, but also\r\nfrom the papal ban which is threatening to depose him from his throne.\r\nAccompanied only by a few faithful followers, she guides him through\r\nmountain fastnesses, where one night the wearied son beholds the spirit\r\nof Frederick II. passing with feudal array through the Abruzzi, and\r\nbeckoning him on to Luceria.\r\n\r\nTo this district, situated in the Papal States, Frederick had, by a\r\npeaceful compact, transplanted the remnant of his Saracen retainers,\r\nwho had previously been wreaking terrible havoc in the mountains of\r\nSicily. To the great annoyance of the Pope, he had handed the town over\r\nto them in fee-simple, thus securing for himself a band of faithful\r\nallies in the heart of an ever-treacherous and hostile country.\r\n\r\nFatima, as my heroine is called, has prepared, through the\r\ninstrumentality of trusty friends, a reception for Manfred in this\r\nplace. When the papal governor has been expelled by a revolution, he\r\nslips through the gateway into the town, is recognised by the whole\r\npopulation as the son of their beloved Emperor, and, amid wildest\r\nenthusiasm, is placed at their head, to lead them against the enemies\r\nof their departed benefactor. In the meantime, while Manfred is\r\nmarching on from victory to victory in his reconquest of the whole\r\nkingdom of Apulia, the tragic centre of my action still continues to be\r\nthe unvoiced longing of the lovelorn victor for the marvellous heroine.\r\n\r\nShe is the child of the great Emperor’s love for a noble Saracen\r\nmaiden. Her mother, on her deathbed, had sent her to Manfred,\r\nforetelling that she would work wonders for his glory provided she\r\nnever yielded to his passion. Whether Fatima was to know that she was\r\nhis sister I left undecided in framing my plot. Meanwhile she is\r\ncareful to show herself to him only at critical moments, and then\r\nalways in such a way as to remain unapproachable. When at last she\r\nwitnesses the completion of her task in his coronation at Naples, she\r\ndetermines, in obedience to her vow, to slip away secretly from the\r\nnewly anointed king, that she may meditate in the solitude of her\r\ndistant home upon the success of her enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Saracen Nurreddin, who had been a companion of her youth, and to\r\nwhose help she had chiefly owed her success in rescuing Manfred, is to\r\nbe the sole partner of her flight. To this man, who loves her with\r\npassionate ardour, she had been promised in her childhood. Before her\r\nsecret departure she pays a last visit to the slumbering king. This\r\nrouses her lover’s furious jealousy, as he construes her act into a\r\nproof of unfaithfulness on the part of his betrothed. The last look of\r\nfarewell which Fatima casts from a distance at the young monarch, on\r\nhis return from his coronation, inflames the jealous lover to wreak\r\ninstant vengeance for the supposed outrage upon his honour. He strikes\r\nthe prophetess to the earth, whereupon she thanks him with a smile for\r\nhaving delivered her from an unbearable existence. At the sight of her\r\nbody Manfred realises that henceforth happiness has deserted him for\r\never.\r\n\r\nThis theme I had adorned with many gorgeous scenes and complicated\r\nsituations, so that when I had worked it out I could regard it as a\r\nfairly suitable, interesting, and effective whole, especially when\r\ncompared with other well-known subjects of a similar nature. Yet I\r\ncould never rouse myself to sufficient enthusiasm over it to give my\r\nserious attention to its elaboration, especially as another theme now\r\nlaid its grip upon me. This was suggested to me by a pamphlet on the\r\n‘Venusberg,’ which accidentally fell into my hands.\r\n\r\nIf all that I regarded as essentially German had hitherto drawn me with\r\never-increasing force, and compelled me to its eager pursuit, I here\r\nfound it suddenly presented to me in the simple outlines of a legend,\r\nbased upon the old and well-known ballad of ‘Tannhäuser.’ True, its\r\nelements were already familiar to me from Tieck’s version in his\r\nPhantasus. But his conception of the subject had flung me back into the\r\nfantastic regions created in my mind at an earlier period by Hoffmann,\r\nand I should certainly never have been tempted to extract the framework\r\nof a dramatic work from his elaborate story. The point in this popular\r\npamphlet which had so much weight with me was that it brought\r\n‘Tannhäuser,’ if only by a passing hint, into touch with ‘The\r\nMinstrel’s War on the Wartburg.’ I had some knowledge of this also from\r\nHoffmann’s account in his Serapionsbrudern. But I felt that the writer\r\nhad only grasped the old legend in a distorted form, and therefore\r\nendeavoured to gain a closer acquaintance with the true aspect of this\r\nattractive story. At this juncture Lehrs brought me the annual report\r\nof the proceedings of the Königsberg German Society, in which the\r\n‘Wartburg contest’ was criticised with a fair amount of detail by\r\nLukas. Here I also found the original text. Although I could utilise\r\nbut little of the real setting for my own purpose, yet the picture it\r\ngave me of Germany in the Middle Ages was so suggestive that I found I\r\nhad not previously had the smallest conception of what it was like.\r\n\r\nAs a sequel to the Wartburg poem, I also found in the same copy a\r\ncritical study, ‘Lohengrin,’ which gave in full detail the main\r\ncontents of that widespread epic.\r\n\r\nThus a whole new world was opened to me, and though as yet I had not\r\nfound the form in which I might cope with Lohengrin, yet this image\r\nalso lived imperishably within me. When, therefore, I afterwards made a\r\nclose acquaintance with the intricacies of this legend, I could\r\nvisualise the figure of the hero with a distinctness equal to that of\r\nmy conception of Tannhäuser at this time.\r\n\r\nUnder these influences my longing for a speedy return to Germany grew\r\never more intense, for there I hoped to earn a new home for myself\r\nwhere I could enjoy leisure for creative work. But it was not yet\r\npossible even to think of occupying myself with such grateful tasks.\r\nThe sordid necessities of life still bound me to Paris. While thus\r\nemployed, I found an opportunity of exerting myself in a way more\r\ncongenial to my desires. When I was a young man at Prague, I had made\r\nthe acquaintance of a Jewish musician and composer called Dessauer—a\r\nman who was not devoid of talent, who in fact achieved a certain\r\nreputation, but was chiefly known among his intimates on account of his\r\nhypochondria. This man, who was now in flourishing circumstances, was\r\nso far patronised by Schlesinger that the latter seriously proposed to\r\nhelp him to a commission for Grand Opera. Dessauer had come across my\r\npoem of the Fliegender Holländer, and now insisted that I should draft\r\na similar plot for him, as M. Leon Pillet’s Vaisseau Fantome had\r\nalready been given to M. Dietsch, the letter’s musical conductor, to\r\nset to music. From this same conductor Dessauer obtained the promise of\r\na like commission, and he now offered me two hundred francs to provide\r\nhim with a similar plot, and one congenial to his hypochondriacal\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\nTo meet this wish I ransacked my brain for recollections of Hoffmann,\r\nand quickly decided to work up his Bergwerke von Falun. The moulding of\r\nthis fascinating and marvellous material succeeded as admirably as I\r\ncould wish. Dessauer also felt convinced that the topic was worth his\r\nwhile to set to music. His dismay was accordingly all the greater when\r\nPillet rejected our plot on the ground that the staging would be too\r\ndifficult, and that the second act especially would entail\r\ninsurmountable obstacles for the ballet, which had to be given each\r\ntime. In place of this Dessauer wished me to compose him an oratorio on\r\n‘Mary Magdalene.’ As on the day that he expressed this wish he appeared\r\nto be suffering from acute melancholia, so much so that he declared he\r\nhad that morning seen his own head lying beside his bed, I thought well\r\nnot to refuse his request. I asked him, therefore, to give me time, and\r\nI regret to say that ever since that day I have continued to take it..\r\n\r\nIt was amid such distractions as these that this winter at length drew\r\nto an end, while my prospects of getting to Germany gradually grew more\r\nhopeful, though with a slowness that sorely tried my patience. I had\r\nkept up a continuous correspondence with Dresden respecting Rienzi, and\r\nin the worthy chorus-master Fischer I at last found an honest man who\r\nwas favourably disposed to me. He sent me reliable and reassuring\r\nreports as to the state of my affairs.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving news, early in January, 1842, of renewed delay, I at\r\nlast heard that by the end of February the work would be ready for\r\nperformance. I was seriously uneasy at this, as I was afraid of not\r\nbeing able to accomplish the journey by that date. But this news also\r\nwas soon contradicted, and the honest Fischer informed me that my opera\r\nhad had to be postponed till the autumn of that year. I realised fully\r\nthat it would never be performed if I could not be present in person at\r\nDresden. When eventually in March Count Redern, the director of the\r\nTheatre Royal in Berlin, told me that my Fliegender Holländer had been\r\naccepted for the opera there, I thought I had sufficient reason to\r\nreturn to Germany at all costs as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI had already had various experiences as to the views of German\r\nmanagers on this work. Relying on the plot, which had pleased the\r\nmanager of the Paris Opera so much, I had sent the libretto in the\r\nfirst instance to my old acquaintance Ringelhardt, the director of the\r\nLeipzig theatre. But the man had cherished an undisguised aversion for\r\nme since my Liebesverbot. As he could not this time possibly object to\r\nany levity in my subject, he now found fault with its gloomy solemnity\r\nand refused to accept it. As I had met Councillor Küstner, at that time\r\nmanager of the Munich Court Theatre, when he was making arrangements\r\nabout La Reine de Chypre in Paris, I now sent him the text of the\r\nDutchman with a similar request. He, too, returned it, with the\r\nassurance that it was not suited to German stage conditions, or to the\r\ntaste of the German public. As he had ordered a French libretto for\r\nMunich, I knew what he meant. When the score was finished, I sent it to\r\nMeyerbeer in Berlin, with a letter for Count Redern, and begged him, as\r\nhe had been unable to help me to anything in Paris, in spite of his\r\ndesire to do so, to be kind enough to use his influence in Berlin in\r\nfavour of my composition. I was genuinely astonished at the truly\r\nprompt acceptance of my work two months later, which was accompanied by\r\nvery gratifying assurances from the Count, and I was delighted to see\r\nin it a proof of Meyerbeer’s sincere and energetic intervention in my\r\nfavour. Strange to say, on my return to Germany soon afterwards, I was\r\ndestined to learn that Count Redern had long since retired from the\r\nmanagement of the Berlin Opera House, and that Küstner of Munich had\r\nalready been appointed his successor; the upshot of this was that Count\r\nRedern’s consent, though very courteous, could not by any means be\r\ntaken seriously, as the realisation of it depended not on him but on\r\nhis successor. What the result was remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nA circumstance that eventually facilitated my long-desired return to\r\nGermany, which was now justified by my good prospects, was the tardily\r\nawakened interest taken in my position by the wealthy members of my\r\nfamily. If Didot had had reasons of his own for applying to the\r\nMinister Villemain for support for Lehrs, so also Avenarius, my\r\nbrother-in-law in Paris, when he heard how I was struggling against\r\npoverty, one day took it into his head to surprise me with some quite\r\nunexpected help secured by his appeal to my sister Louisa. On 26th\r\nDecember of the fast-waning year 1841 I went home to Minna carrying a\r\ngoose under my arm, and in the beak of the bird we found a\r\nfive-hundred-franc note. This note had been given me by Avenarius as\r\nthe result of a request on my behalf made by my sister Louisa to a\r\nfriend of hers, a wealthy merchant named Schletter. This welcome\r\naddition to our extremely straitened resources might not in itself have\r\nbeen sufficient to put me in an exceedingly good-humour, had I not\r\nclearly seen in it the prospect of escaping altogether from my position\r\nin Paris. As the leading German managers had now consented to the\r\nperformance of two of my compositions, I thought I might seriously\r\nreproach my brother-in-law, Friedrich Brockhaus, who had repulsed me\r\nthe year before when I applied to him in great distress, on the ground\r\nthat he ‘disapproved of my profession.’ This time I might be more\r\nsuccessful in securing the wherewithal for my return. I was not\r\nmistaken, and when the time came I was supplied from this source with\r\nthe necessary travelling expenses.\r\n\r\nWith these prospects, and my position thus improved, I found myself\r\nspending the second half of the winter 1841-42 in high spirits, and\r\naffording constant entertainment to the small circle of friends which\r\nmy relationship to Avenarius had created around me. Minna and I\r\nfrequently spent our evenings with this family and others, amongst whom\r\nI have pleasant recollections of a certain Herr Kuhne, the head of a\r\nprivate school, and his wife. I contributed so greatly to the success\r\nof their little soirees, and was always so willing to improvise dances\r\non the piano for them to dance to, that I soon ran the risk of enjoying\r\nan almost burdensome popularity.\r\n\r\nAt length the hour struck for my deliverance; the day came on which, as\r\nI devoutly hoped, I might turn my back on Paris for ever. It was the\r\n7th of April, and Paris was already gay with the first luxuriant\r\nbuddings of spring. In front of our windows, which all the winter had\r\nlooked upon a bleak and desolate garden, the trees were burgeoning, and\r\nthe birds sang. Our emotion at parting from our dear friends Anders,\r\nLehrs, and Kietz, however, was great, almost overwhelming. The first\r\nseemed already doomed to an early death, for his health was exceedingly\r\nbad, and he was advanced in years. About Lehrs’ condition, as I have\r\nalready said, there could no longer be any doubt, and it was dreadful,\r\nafter so short an experience as the two and a half years which I had\r\nspent in Paris, to see the ravages that want had wrought among good,\r\nnoble, and sometimes even distinguished men. Kietz, for whose future I\r\nwas concerned, less on grounds of health than of morals, touched our\r\nhearts once more by his boundless and almost childlike good-nature.\r\nFancying, for instance, that I might not have enough money for the\r\njourney, he forced me, in spite of all resistance, to accept another\r\nfive-franc piece, which was about all that remained of his own fortune\r\nat the moment: he also stuffed a packet of good French snuff for me\r\ninto the pocket of the coach, in which we at last rumbled through the\r\nboulevards to the barriers, which we passed but were unable to see this\r\ntime, because our eyes were blinded with tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n1842-1850\r\n\r\n\r\nThe journey from Paris to Dresden at that time took five days and\r\nnights. On the German frontier, near Forbach, we met with stormy\r\nweather and snow, a greeting which seemed inhospitable after the spring\r\nwe had already enjoyed in Paris. And, indeed, as we continued our\r\njourney through our native land once more, we found much to dishearten\r\nus, and I could not help thinking that the Frenchmen who on leaving\r\nGermany breathed more freely on reaching French soil, and unbuttoned\r\ntheir coats, as though passing from winter into summer, were not so\r\nvery foolish after all, seeing that we, for our part, were now\r\ncompelled to seek protection against this conspicuous change of\r\ntemperature by being very careful to put on sufficient clothing. The\r\nunkindness of the elements became perfect torture when, later on,\r\nbetween Frankfort and Leipzig, we were swept into the stream of\r\nvisitors to the Great Easter Fair.\r\n\r\nThe pressure on the mail-coaches was so great, that for two days and a\r\nnight, amid ceaseless storm, snow and rain, we were continually\r\nchanging from one wretched ‘substitute’ to another, thus turning our\r\njourney into an adventure of almost the same type as our former voyage\r\nat sea.\r\n\r\nOne solitary flash of brightness was afforded by our view of the\r\nWartburg, which we passed during the only sunlit hour of this journey.\r\nThe sight of this mountain fastness, which, from the Fulda side, is\r\nclearly visible for a long time, affected me deeply. A neighbouring\r\nridge further on I at once christened the Horselberg, and as we drove\r\nthrough the valley, pictured to myself the scenery for the third act of\r\nmy Tannhäuser. This scene remained so vividly in my mind, that long\r\nafterwards I was able to give Desplechin, the Parisian scene-painter,\r\nexact details when he was working out the scenery under my direction.\r\nIf I had already been impressed by the significance of the fact that my\r\nfirst journey through the German Rhine district, so famous in legend,\r\nshould have been made on my way home from Paris, it seemed an even more\r\nominous coincidence that my first sight of Wartburg, which was so rich\r\nin historical and mythical associations, should come just at this\r\nmoment. The view so warmed my heart against wind and weather, Jews and\r\nthe Leipzig Fair, that in the end I arrived, on 12th April, 1842, safe\r\nand sound, with my poor, battered, half-frozen wife, in that selfsame\r\ncity of Dresden which I had last seen on the occasion of my sad\r\nseparation from my Minna, and my departure for my northern place of\r\nexile.\r\n\r\nWe put up at the ‘Stadt Gotha’ inn. The city, in which such momentous\r\nyears of my childhood and boyhood had been spent, seemed cold and dead\r\nbeneath the influences of the wild, gloomy weather. Indeed, everything\r\nthere that could remind me of my youth seemed dead. No hospitable house\r\nreceived us. We found my wife’s parents living in cramped and dingy\r\nlodgings in very straitened circumstances, and were obliged at once to\r\nlook about for a small abode for ourselves. This we found in the\r\nTopfergasse for twenty-one marks a month. After paying the necessary\r\nbusiness visits in connection with Rienzi, and making arrangements for\r\nMinna during my brief absence, I set out on 15th April direct for\r\nLeipzig, where I saw my mother and family for the first time in six\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, which had been so eventful for my own life, my\r\nmother had undergone a great change in her domestic position through\r\nthe death of Rosalie. She was living in a pleasant roomy flat near the\r\nBrockhaus family, where she was free from all those household cares to\r\nwhich, owing to her large family, she had devoted so many years of\r\nanxious thought. Her bustling energy, which had almost amounted to\r\nhardness, had entirely given place to a natural cheerfulness and\r\ninterest in the family prosperity of her married daughters. For the\r\nblissful calm of this happy old age she was mainly indebted to the\r\naffectionate care of her son-in-law, Friedrich Brockhaus, to whom I\r\nexpressed my heartfelt thanks for his goodness. She was exceedingly\r\nastonished and pleased to see me unexpectedly enter her room. Any\r\nbitterness that ever existed between us had utterly vanished, and her\r\nonly complaint was that she could not put me up in her house, instead\r\nof my brother Julius, the unfortunate goldsmith, who had none of the\r\nqualities that could make him a suitable companion for her. She was\r\nfull of hope for the success of my undertaking, and felt this\r\nconfidence strengthened by the favourable prophecy which our dear\r\nRosalie had made about me shortly before her sad death.\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, I only stayed a few days in Leipzig, as I had\r\nfirst to visit Berlin in order to make definite arrangements with Count\r\nRedern for the performance of the Fliegender Holländer. As I have\r\nalready observed, I was here at once destined to learn that the Count\r\nwas on the point of retiring from the directorship, and he accordingly\r\nreferred me for all further decisions to the new director, Küstner, who\r\nhad not yet arrived in Berlin. I now suddenly realised what this\r\nstrange circumstance meant, and knew that, so far as the Berlin\r\nnegotiations went, I might as well have remained in Paris. This\r\nimpression was in the main confirmed by a visit to Meyerbeer, who, I\r\nfound, regarded my coming to Berlin as over hasty. Nevertheless, he\r\nbehaved in a kind and friendly manner, only regretting that he was just\r\non the point of ‘going away,’ a state in which I always found him\r\nwhenever I visited him again in Berlin.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn was also in the capital about this time, having been\r\nappointed one of the General Musical Directors to the King of Prussia.\r\nI also sought him out, having been previously introduced to him in\r\nLeipzig. He informed me that he did not believe his work would prosper\r\nin Berlin, and that he would rather go back to Leipzig. I made no\r\ninquiry about the fate of the score of my great symphony performed at\r\nLeipzig in earlier days, which I had more or less forced upon him so\r\nmany years ago. On the other hand, he did not betray to me any signs of\r\nremembering that strange offering. In the midst of the lavish comforts\r\nof his home he struck me as cold, yet it was not so much that he\r\nrepelled me as that I recoiled from him. I also paid a visit to\r\nRellstab, to whom I had a letter of introduction from his trusty\r\npublisher, my brother-in-law Brockhaus. Here it was not so much smug\r\nease that I encountered; I doubtless felt repulsed more by the fact\r\nthat he showed no inclination whatever to interest himself in my\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nI grew very low spirited in Berlin. I could almost have wished\r\nCommissioner Cerf back again. Miserable as had been the time I had\r\nspent here years before, I had then, at any rate, met one man, who, for\r\nall the bluntness of his exterior, had treated me with true\r\nfriendliness and consideration. In vain did I try to call to mind the\r\nBerlin through whose streets I had walked, with all the ardour of\r\nyouth, by the side of Laube. After my acquaintance with London, and\r\nstill more with Paris, this city, with its sordid spaces and\r\npretensions to greatness, depressed me deeply, and I breathed a hope\r\nthat, should no luck crown my life, it might at least be spent in Paris\r\nrather than in Berlin.\r\n\r\nOn my return from this wholly fruitless expedition, I first went to\r\nLeipzig for a few days, where, on this occasion, I stayed with my\r\nbrother-in-law, Hermann Brockhaus, who was now Professor of Oriental\r\nLanguages at the University. His family had been increased by the birth\r\nof two daughters, and the atmosphere of unruffled content, illuminated\r\nby mental activity and a quiet but vivid interest in all things\r\nrelating to the higher aspects of life, greatly moved my homeless and\r\nvagabond soul. One evening, after my sister had seen to her children,\r\nwhom she had brought up very well, and had sent them with gentle words\r\nto bed, we gathered in the large richly stocked library for our evening\r\nmeal and a long confidential chat. Here I broke out into a violent fit\r\nof weeping, and it seemed as though the tender sister, who five years\r\nbefore had known me during the bitterest straits of my early married\r\nlife in Dresden, now really understood me. At the express suggestion of\r\nmy brother-in-law Hermann, my family tendered me a loan, to help me to\r\ntide over the time of waiting for the performance of my Rienzi in\r\nDresden. This, they said, they regarded merely as a duty, and assured\r\nme that I need have no hesitation whatever in accepting it. It\r\nconsisted of a sum of six hundred marks, which was to be paid me in\r\nmonthly instalments for six months. As I had no prospect of being able\r\nto reply on any other source of income, there was every chance of\r\nMinna’s talent for management being put severely to the test, if this\r\nwere to carry us through; it could be done, however, and I was able to\r\nreturn to Dresden with a great sense of relief.\r\n\r\nWhile I was staying with my relatives I played and sang them the\r\nFliegender Holländer for the first time connectedly, and seemed to\r\narouse considerable interest by my performance, for when, later on, my\r\nsister Louisa heard the opera in Dresden, she complained that much of\r\nthe effect previously produced by my rendering did not come back to\r\nher. I also sought out my old friend Apel again. The poor man had gone\r\nstone blind, but he astonished me by his cheeriness and contentment,\r\nand thereby once and for all deprived me of any reason for pitying him.\r\nAs he declared that he knew the blue coat I was wearing very well,\r\nthough it was really a brown one, I thought it best not to argue the\r\npoint, and I left Leipzig in a state of wonder at finding every one\r\nthere so happy and contented.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Dresden, on 26th April, I found occasion to grapple more\r\nvigorously with my lot. Here I was enlivened by closer intercourse with\r\nthe people on whom I had to rely for a successful production of Rienzi.\r\nIt is true that the results of my interviews with Lüttichau, the\r\ngeneral manager, and Reissiger, the musical conductor, left me cold and\r\nincredulous. Both were sincerely astonished at my arrival in Dresden;\r\nand the same might even be said of my frequent correspondent and\r\npatron, Hofrath Winkler, who also would have preferred my remaining in\r\nParis. But, as has been my constant experience both before and since,\r\nhelp and encouragement have always come to me from humbler and never\r\nfrom the more exalted ranks of life.\r\n\r\nSo in this case, too, I met my first agreeable sensation in the\r\noverwhelmingly cordial reception I received from the old chorus-master,\r\nWilhelm Fischer. I had had no previous acquaintance with him, yet he\r\nwas the only person who had taken the trouble to read my score\r\ncarefully, and had not only conceived serious hopes for the success of\r\nmy opera, but had worked energetically to secure its being accepted and\r\npractised. The moment I entered his room and told him my name, he\r\nrushed to embrace me with a loud cry, and in a second I was translated\r\nto an atmosphere of hope. Besides this man, I met in the actor\r\nFerdinand Heine and his family another sure foundation for hearty and,\r\nindeed, deep-rooted friendship. It is true that I had known him from\r\nchildhood, for at that time he was one of the few young people whom my\r\nstepfather Geyer liked to see about him. In addition to a fairly\r\ndecided talent for drawing, it was chiefly his pleasant social gifts\r\nthat had won him an entrance into our more intimate family circle. As\r\nhe was very small and slight, my stepfather nicknamed him DavidCHEN,\r\nand under this appellation he used to take part with great affability\r\nand good-humour in our little festivities, and above all in our\r\nfriendly excursions into the neighbouring country, in which, as I\r\nmentioned in its place, even Carl Maria von Weber used to join.\r\nBelonging to the good old school, he had become a useful, if not\r\nprominent, member of the Dresden stage. He possessed all the knowledge\r\nand qualities for a good stage manager, but never succeeded in inducing\r\nthe committee to give him that appointment. It was only as a designer\r\nof costumes that he found further scope for his talents, and in this\r\ncapacity he was included in the consultations over the staging of\r\nRienzi.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that he had the opportunity of busying himself with\r\nthe work of a member, now grown to man’s estate, of the very family\r\nwith whom he had spent such pleasant days in his youth. He greeted me\r\nat once as a child of the house, and we two homeless creatures found in\r\nour memories of this long-lost home the first common basis to our\r\nfriendship. We generally spent our evenings with old Fischer at\r\nHeine’s, where, amid hopeful conversation, we regaled ourselves on\r\npotatoes and herrings, of which the meal chiefly consisted.\r\nSchroder-Devrient was away on a holiday; Tichatschek, who was also on\r\nthe point of going away, I had just time to see, and with him I went\r\nquickly through a part of his role in Rienzi. His brisk and lively\r\nnature, his glorious voice and great musical talent, gave special\r\nweight to his encouraging assurance that he delighted in the role of\r\nRienzi. Heine also told me that the mere prospect of having many new\r\ncostumes, and especially new silver armour, had inspired Tichatschek\r\nwith the liveliest desire to play this part, so that I might rely on\r\nhim under any circumstances. Thus I could at once give closer attention\r\nto the preparations for practice, which was fixed to begin in the late\r\nsummer, after the principal singers had returned from their holiday.\r\n\r\nI had to make special efforts to pacify my friend Fischer by my\r\nreadiness to abbreviate the score, which was excessively lengthy. His\r\nintentions in the matter were so honest that I gladly sat down with him\r\nto the wearisome task. I played and sang my score to the astonished man\r\non an old grand piano in the rehearsing-room of the Court Theatre, with\r\nsuch frantic vigour that, although he did not mind if the instrument\r\ncame to grief, he grew concerned about my chest. Finally, amid hearty\r\nlaughter, he ceased to argue about cutting down passages, as precisely\r\nwhere he thought something might be omitted I proved to him with\r\nheadlong eloquence that it was precisely here that the main point lay.\r\nHe plunged with me head over heels into the vast chaos of sound,\r\nagainst which he could raise no objection, beyond the testimony of his\r\nwatch, whose correctness I also ended by disputing. As sops I\r\nlight-heartedly flung him the big pantomime and most of the ballet in\r\nthe second act, whereby I reckoned we might save a whole half-hour.\r\nThus, thank goodness, the whole monster was at last handed over to the\r\nclerks to make a fair copy of, and the rest was left for time to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nWe next discussed what we should do in the summer, and I decided upon a\r\nstay of several months at Toplitz, the scene of my first youthful\r\nflights, whose fine air and baths, I hoped, would also benefit Minna’s\r\nhealth. But before we could carry out this intention I had to pay\r\nseveral more visits to Leipzig to settle the fate of my Dutchman. On\r\n5th May I proceeded thither to have an interview with Küstner, the new\r\ndirector of the Berlin Opera, who I had been told had just arrived\r\nthere. He was now placed in the awkward position of being about to\r\nproduce in Berlin the very opera which he had before declined in\r\nMunich, as it had been accepted by his predecessor in office. He\r\npromised me to consider what steps he would take in this predicament.\r\nIn order to learn the result of Küstner’s deliberations, I determined,\r\non 2nd June, to seek him out, and this time in Berlin itself. But at\r\nLeipzig I found a letter in which he begged me to wait patiently a\r\nlittle longer for his final verdict. I took advantage of being in the\r\nneighbourhood of Halle to pay a visit to my eldest brother Albert. I\r\nwas very much grieved and depressed to find the poor fellow, whom I\r\nmust give the credit of having the greatest perseverance and a quite\r\nremarkable talent for dramatic song, living in the unworthy and mean\r\ncircumstances which the Halle Theatre offered to him and his family.\r\nThe realisation of conditions into which I myself had once nearly sunk\r\nnow filled me with indescribable abhorrence. Still more harrowing was\r\nit to hear my brother speak of this state in tones which showed, alas,\r\nonly too plainly, the hopeless submission with which he had already\r\nresigned himself to its horrors. The only consolation I could find was\r\nthe personality and childlike nature of his step-daughter Johanna, who\r\nwas then fifteen, and who sang me Spohr’s Rose, wie bist du so schon\r\nwith great expression and in a voice of an extraordinarily beautiful\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThen I returned to Dresden, and at last, in wonderful weather,\r\nundertook the pleasant journey to Toplitz with Minna and one of her\r\nsisters, reaching that place on 9th June, where we took up our quarters\r\nat a second-class inn, the Eiche, at Schonau. Here we were soon joined\r\nby my mother, who paid her usual yearly visit to the warm baths all the\r\nmore gladly this time because she knew she would find me there. If she\r\nhad before had any prejudice against Minna because of my premature\r\nmarriage to her, a closer acquaintance with her domestic gifts soon\r\nchanged it into respect, and she quickly learned to love the partner of\r\nmy doleful days in Paris. Although my mother’s vagaries demanded no\r\nsmall consideration, yet what particularly delighted me about her was\r\nthe astonishing vivacity of her almost childlike imagination, a faculty\r\nshe retained to such a degree that one morning she complained that my\r\nrelation of the Tannhäuser legend on the previous evening had given her\r\na whole night of pleasant but most tiring sleeplessness.\r\n\r\nBy dint of appealing letters to Schletter, a wealthy patron of art in\r\nLeipzig, I managed to do something for Kietz, who, had remained behind\r\nin misery in Paris, and also to provide Minna with medical treatment. I\r\nalso succeeded to a certain extent in ameliorating my own woeful\r\nfinancial position. Scarcely were these tasks accomplished, when I\r\nstarted off in my old boyish way on a ramble of several days on foot\r\nthrough the Bohemian mountains, in order that I might mentally work out\r\nmy plan of the ‘Venusberg’ amid the pleasant associations of such a\r\ntrip. Here I took the fancy of engaging quarters in Aussig on the\r\nromantic Schreckenstein, where for several days I occupied the little\r\npublic room, in which straw was laid down for me to sleep on at night.\r\nI found recreation in daily ascents of the Wostrai, the highest peak in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and so keenly did the fantastic solitude quicken my\r\nyouthful spirit, that I clambered about the ruins of the Schreckenstein\r\nthe whole of one moonlit night, wrapped only in a blanket, in order\r\nmyself to provide the ghost that was lacking, and delighted myself with\r\nthe hope of scaring some passing wayfarer.\r\n\r\nHere I drew up in my pocket-book the detailed plan of a three-act opera\r\non the ‘Venusberg,’ and subsequently carried out the composition of\r\nthis work in strict accordance with the sketch I then made.\r\n\r\nOne day, when climbing the Wostrai, I was astonished, on turning the\r\ncorner of a valley, to hear a merry dance tune whistled by a goatherd\r\nperched up on a crag. I seemed immediately to stand among the chorus of\r\npilgrims filing past the goatherd in the valley; but I could not\r\nafterwards recall the goatherd’s tune, so I was obliged to help myself\r\nout of the matter in the usual way.\r\n\r\nEnriched by these spoils, I returned to Toplitz in a wonderfully\r\ncheerful frame of mind and robust health, but on receiving the\r\ninteresting news that Tichatschek and Schroder-Devrient were on the\r\npoint of returning, I was impelled to set off once more for Dresden. I\r\ntook this step, not so much to avoid missing any of the early\r\nrehearsals of Rienzi, as because I wanted to prevent the management\r\nreplacing it by something else. I left Minna for a time with my mother,\r\nand reached Dresden on 18th July.\r\n\r\nI hired a small lodging in a queer house, since pulled down, facing the\r\nMaximilian Avenue, and entered into a fairly lively intercourse with\r\nour operatic stars who had just returned. My old enthusiasm for\r\nSchroder-Devrient revived when I saw her again more frequently in\r\nopera. Strange was the effect produced upon me when I heard her for the\r\nfirst time in Gretry’s Blaubart, for I could not help remembering that\r\nthis was the first opera I had ever seen. I had been taken to it as a\r\nboy of five (also in Dresden), and I still retained my wondrous first\r\nimpressions of it. All my earliest childish memories were revived, and\r\nI recollected how frequently and with what emphasis I had myself sung\r\nBluebeard’s song: Ha, die Falsche! Die Thure offen! to the amusement of\r\nthe whole house, with a paper helmet of my own making on my head. My\r\nfriend Heine still remembered it well.\r\n\r\nIn other respects the operatic performances were not such as to impress\r\nme very favourably: I particularly missed the rolling sound of the\r\nfully equipped Parisian orchestra of string instruments. I also noticed\r\nthat, when opening the fine new theatre, they had quite forgotten to\r\nincrease the number of these instruments in proportion to the enlarged\r\nspace. In this, as well as in the general equipment of the stage, which\r\nwas materially deficient in many respects, I was impressed by the sense\r\nof a certain meanness about theatrical enterprise in Germany, which\r\nbecame most noticeable when reproductions were given, often with\r\nwretched translations of the text, of the Paris opera repertoire. If\r\neven in Paris my dissatisfaction with this treatment of opera had been\r\ngreat, the feeling which once drove me thither from the German theatres\r\nnow returned with redoubled energy. I actually felt degraded again, and\r\nnourished within my breast a contempt so deep that for a time I could\r\nhardly endure the thought of signing a lasting contract, even with one\r\nof the most up-to-date of German opera houses, but sadly wondered what\r\nsteps I could take to hold my ground between disgust and desire in this\r\nstrange world.\r\n\r\nNothing but the sympathy inspired by communion with persons endowed\r\nwith exceptional gifts enabled me to triumph over my scruples. This\r\nstatement applies above all to my great ideal, Schroder-Devrient, in\r\nwhose artistic triumphs it had once been my most burning desire to be\r\nassociated. It is true that many years had elapsed since my first\r\nyouthful impressions of her were formed. As regards her looks, the\r\nverdict which, in the following winter, was sent to Paris by Berlioz\r\nduring his stay in Dresden, was so far correct that her somewhat\r\n‘maternal’ stoutness was unsuited to youthful parts, especially in male\r\nattire, which, as in Rienzi, made too great a demand upon the\r\nimagination. Her voice, which in point of quality had never been an\r\nexceptionally good medium for song, often landed her in difficulties,\r\nand in particular she was forced, when singing, to drag the time a\r\nlittle all through. But her achievements were less hampered now by\r\nthese material hindrances than by the fact that her repertoire\r\nconsisted of a limited number of leading parts, which she had sung so\r\nfrequently that a certain monotony in the conscious calculation of\r\neffect often developed into a mannerism which, from her tendency to\r\nexaggeration, was at times almost painful.\r\n\r\nAlthough these defects could not escape me, yet I, more than any one,\r\nwas especially qualified to overlook such minor weaknesses, and realise\r\nwith enthusiasm the incomparable greatness of her performances. Indeed,\r\nit only needed the stimulus of excitement, which this actress’s\r\nexceptionally eventful life still procured, fully to restore the\r\ncreative power of her prime, a fact of which I was subsequently to\r\nreceive striking demonstrations. But I was seriously troubled and\r\ndepressed at seeing how strong was the disintegrating effect of\r\ntheatrical life upon the character of this singer, who had originally\r\nbeen endowed with such great and noble qualities. From the very mouth\r\nthrough which the great actress’s inspired musical utterances reached\r\nme, I was compelled to hear at other times very similar language to\r\nthat in which, with but few exceptions, nearly all heroines of the\r\nstage indulge. The possession of a naturally fine voice, or even mere\r\nphysical advantages, which might place her rivals on the same footing\r\nas herself in public favour, was more than she could endure; and so far\r\nwas she from acquiring the dignified resignation worthy of a great\r\nartist, that her jealousy increased to a painful extent as years went\r\non. I noticed this all the more because I had reason to suffer from it.\r\nA fact which caused me even greater trouble, however, was that she did\r\nnot grasp music easily, and the study of a new part involved\r\ndifficulties which meant many a painful hour for the composer who had\r\nto make her master his work. Her difficulty in learning new parts, and\r\nparticularly that of Adriano in Rienzi, entailed disappointments for\r\nher which caused me a good deal of trouble.\r\n\r\nIf, in her case, I had to handle a great and sensitive nature very\r\ntenderly, I had, on the other hand, a very easy task with Tichatschek,\r\nwith his childish limitations and superficial, but exceptionally\r\nbrilliant, talents. He did not trouble to learn his parts by heart, as\r\nhe was so musical that he could sing the most difficult music at sight,\r\nand thought all further study needless, whereas with most other singers\r\nthe work consisted in mastering the score. Hence, if he sang through a\r\npart at rehearsals often enough to impress it on his memory, the rest,\r\nthat is to say, everything pertaining to vocal art and dramatic\r\ndelivery, would follow naturally. In this way he picked up any clerical\r\nerrors there might be in the libretto, and that with such incorrigible\r\npertinacity, that he uttered the wrong words with just the same\r\nexpression as if they were correct. He waved aside good-humouredly any\r\nexpostulations or hints as to the sense with the remark, ‘Ah! that will\r\nbe all right soon.’ And, in fact, I very soon resigned myself and quite\r\ngave up trying to get the singer to use his intelligence in the\r\ninterpretation of the part of the hero, for which I was very agreeably\r\ncompensated by the light-hearted enthusiasm with which he flung himself\r\ninto his congenial role, and the irresistible effect of his brilliant\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of these two actors who played the leading parts, I\r\nhad only very moderate material at my disposal. But there was plenty of\r\ngoodwill, and I had recourse to an ingenious device to induce Reissiger\r\nthe conductor to hold frequent piano rehearsals. He had complained to\r\nme of the difficulty he had always found in securing a well-written\r\nlibretto, and thought it was very sensible of me to have acquired the\r\nhabit of writing my own. In his youth he had unfortunately neglected to\r\ndo this for himself, and yet this was all he lacked to make a\r\nsuccessful dramatic composer. I feel bound to confess that he possessed\r\n‘a good deal of melody’; but this, he added, did not seem sufficient to\r\ninspire the singers with the requisite enthusiasm. His experience was\r\nthat Schroder-Devrient, in his Adele de Foix, would render very\r\nindifferently the same final passage with which, in Bellini’s Romeo and\r\nJuliet, she would put the audience into an ecstasy. The reason for\r\nthis, he presumed, must lie in the subject-matter. I at once promised\r\nhim that I would supply him with a libretto in which he would be able\r\nto introduce these and similar melodies to the greatest advantage. To\r\nthis he gladly agreed, and I therefore set aside for versification, as\r\na suitable text for Reissiger, my Hohe Braut, founded on Konig’s\r\nromance, which I had once before submitted to Scribe. I promised to\r\nbring Reissiger a page of verse for every piano rehearsal, and this I\r\nfaithfully did until the whole book was done. I was much surprised to\r\nlearn some time later that Reissiger had had a new libretto written for\r\nhim by an actor named Kriethe. This was called the Wreck of the Medusa.\r\nI then learned that the wife of the conductor, who was a suspicious\r\nwoman, had been filled with the greatest concern at my readiness to\r\ngive up a libretto to her husband. They both thought the book was good\r\nand full of striking effects, but they suspected some sort of trap in\r\nthe background, to escape from which they must certainly exercise the\r\ngreatest caution. The result was that I regained possession of my\r\nlibretto and was able, later on, to help my old friend Kittl with it in\r\nPrague; he set it to music of his own, and entitled it Die Franzosen\r\nvor Nizza. I heard that it was frequently performed in Prague with\r\ngreat success, though I never saw it myself; and I was also told at the\r\nsame time by a local critic that this text was a proof of my real\r\naptitude as a librettist, and that it was a mistake for me to devote\r\nmyself to composition. As regards my Tannhäuser, on the other hand,\r\nLaube used to declare it was a misfortune that I had not got an\r\nexperienced dramatist to supply me with a decent text for my music.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, however, this work of versification had the desired\r\nresult, and Reissiger kept steadily to the study of Rienzi. But what\r\nencouraged him even more than my verses was the growing interest of the\r\nsingers, and above all the genuine enthusiasm of Tichatschek. This man,\r\nwho had been so ready to leave the delights of the theatre piano for a\r\nshooting party, now looked upon the rehearsals of Rienzi as a genuine\r\ntreat. He always attended them with radiant eyes and boisterous\r\ngood-humour. I soon felt myself in a state of constant exhilaration:\r\nfavourite passages were greeted with acclamation by the singers at\r\nevery rehearsal, and a concerted number of the third finale, which\r\nunfortunately had afterwards to be omitted owing to its length,\r\nactually became on that occasion a source of profit to me. For\r\nTichatschek maintained that this B minor was so lovely that something\r\nought to be paid for it every time, and he put down a silver penny,\r\ninviting the others to do the same, to which they all responded\r\nmerrily. From that day forward, whenever we came to this passage at\r\nrehearsals, the cry was raised, ‘Here comes the silver penny part,’ and\r\nSchroder-Devrient, as she took out her purse, remarked that these\r\nrehearsals would ruin her. This gratuity was conscientiously handed to\r\nme each time, and no one suspected that these contributions, which were\r\ngiven as a joke, were often a very welcome help towards defraying the\r\ncost of our daily food. For Minna had returned from Toplitz, at the\r\nbeginning of August, accompanied by my mother.\r\n\r\nWe lived very frugally in chilly lodgings, hopefully awaiting the tardy\r\nday of our deliverance. The months of August and September passed, in\r\npreparation for my work, amid frequent disturbances caused by the\r\nfluctuating and scanty repertoire of a German opera house, and not\r\nuntil October did the combined rehearsals assume such a character as to\r\npromise the certainty of a speedy production. From the very beginning\r\nof the general rehearsals with the orchestra we all shared the\r\nconviction that the opera would, without doubt, be a great success.\r\nFinally, the full dress rehearsals produced a perfectly intoxicating\r\neffect. When we tried the first scene of the second act with the\r\nscenery complete, and the messengers of peace entered, there was a\r\ngeneral outburst of emotion, and even Schroder-Devrient, who was\r\nbitterly prejudiced against her part, as it was not the role of the\r\nheroine, could only answer my questions in a voice stifled with tears.\r\nI believe the whole theatrical body, down to its humblest officials,\r\nloved me as though I were a real prodigy, and I am probably not far\r\nwrong in saying that much of this arose from sympathy and lively\r\nfellow-feeling for a young man, whose exceptional difficulties were not\r\nunknown to them, and who now suddenly stepped out of perfect obscurity\r\ninto splendour. During the interval at the full dress rehearsal, while\r\nother members had dispersed to revive their jaded nerves with lunch, I\r\nremained seated on a pile of boards on the stage, in order that no one\r\nmight realise that I was in the quandary of being unable to obtain\r\nsimilar refreshment. An invalid Italian singer, who was taking a small\r\npart in the opera, seemed to notice this, and kindly brought me a glass\r\nof wine and a piece of bread. I was sorry that I was obliged to deprive\r\nhim of even his small part in the course of the year, for its loss\r\nprovoked such ill-treatment from his wife, that by conjugal tyranny he\r\nwas driven into the ranks of my enemies. When, after my flight from\r\nDresden in 1849, I learned that I had been denounced to the police by\r\nthis same singer for supposed complicity in the rising which took place\r\nin that town, I bethought me of this breakfast during the Rienzi\r\nrehearsal, and felt I was being punished for my ingratitude, for I knew\r\nI was guilty of having brought him into trouble with his wife.\r\n\r\nThe frame of mind in which I looked forward to the first performance of\r\nmy work was a unique experience which I have never felt either before\r\nor since. My kind sister Clara fully shared my feelings. She had been\r\nliving a wretched middle-class life at Chemnitz, which, just about this\r\ntime, she had left to come and share my fate in Dresden. The poor\r\nwoman, whose undoubted artistic gifts had faded so early, was\r\nlaboriously dragging out a commonplace bourgeois existence as a wife\r\nand mother; but now, under the influence of my growing success, she\r\nbegan joyously to breathe a new life. She and I and the worthy\r\nchorus-master Fischer used to spend our evenings with the Heine family,\r\nstill over potatoes and herrings, and often in a wonderfully elated\r\nframe of mind. The evening before our first performance I was able to\r\ncrown our happiness by myself ladling out a bowl of punch. With mingled\r\ntears and laughter we skipped about like happy children, and then in\r\nsleep prepared ourselves for the triumphant day to which we looked\r\nforward with such confidence..\r\n\r\nAlthough on the morning of 20th October, 1842 I had resolved not to\r\ndisturb any of my singers by a visit, yet I happened to come across one\r\nof them, a stiff Philistine called Risse, who was playing a minor bass\r\npart in a dull but respectable way. The day was rather cool, but\r\nwonderfully bright and sunshiny, after the gloomy weather we had just\r\nbeen having. Without a word this curious creature saluted me and then\r\nremained standing, as though bewitched. He simply gazed into my face\r\nwith wonder and rapture, in order to find out, so he at last managed to\r\ntell me in strange confusion, how a man looked who that very day was to\r\nface such an exceptional fate. I smiled and reflected that it was\r\nindeed a day of crisis, and promised him that I would soon drink a\r\nglass with him, at the Stadt Hamburg inn, of the excellent wine he had\r\nrecommended to me with so much agitation.\r\n\r\nNo subsequent experience of mine can be compared with the sensations\r\nwhich marked the day of the first production of Rienzi. At all the\r\nfirst performances of my works in later days, I have been so absorbed\r\nby an only too well-founded anxiety as to their success, that I could\r\nneither enjoy the opera nor form any real estimate of its reception by\r\nthe public. As for my subsequent experiences at the general rehearsal\r\nof Tristan und Isolde, this took place under such exceptional\r\ncircumstances, and its effect upon me differed so fundamentally from\r\nthat produced by the first performance of Rienzi, that no comparison\r\ncan possibly be drawn between the two.\r\n\r\nThe immediate success of Rienzi was no doubt assured beforehand. But\r\nthe emphatic way in which the audience declared their appreciation was\r\nthus far exceptional, that in cities like Dresden the spectators are\r\nnever in a position to decide conclusively upon a work of importance on\r\nthe first night, and consequently assume an attitude of chilling\r\nrestraint towards the works of unknown authors. But this was, in the\r\nnature of things, an exceptional case, for the numerous staff of the\r\ntheatre and the body of musicians had inundated the city beforehand\r\nwith such glowing reports of my opera, that the whole population\r\nawaited the promised miracle in feverish expectation. I sat with Minna,\r\nmy sister Clara, and the Heine family in a pit-box, and when I try to\r\nrecall my condition during that evening, I can only picture it with all\r\nthe paraphernalia of a dream. Of real pleasure or agitation I felt none\r\nat all: I seemed to stand quite aloof from my work; whereas the sight\r\nof the thickly crowded auditorium agitated me so much, that I was\r\nunable even to glance at the body of the audience, whose presence\r\nmerely affected me like some natural phenomenon—something like a\r\ncontinuous downpour of rain—from which I sought shelter in the farthest\r\ncorner of my box as under a protecting roof. I was quite unconscious of\r\napplause, and when at the end of the acts I was tempestuously called\r\nfor, I had every time to be forcibly reminded by Heine and driven on to\r\nthe stage. On the other hand, one great anxiety filled me with growing\r\nalarm: I noticed that the first two acts had taken as long as the whole\r\nof Freischutz, for instance. On account of its warlike calls to arms\r\nthe third act begins with an exceptional uproar, and when at its close\r\nthe clock pointed to ten, which meant that the performance had already\r\nlasted full four hours, I became perfectly desperate. The fact that\r\nafter this act, also, I was again loudly called, I regarded merely as a\r\nfinal courtesy on the part of the audience, who wished to signify that\r\nthey had had quite enough for one evening, and would now leave the\r\nhouse in a body. As we had still two acts before us, I thought it\r\nsettled that we should not be able to finish the piece, and apologised\r\nfor my lack of wisdom in not having previously effected the necessary\r\ncurtailments. Now, thanks to my folly, I found myself in the unheard-of\r\npredicament of being unable to finish an opera, otherwise extremely\r\nwell received, simply because it was absurdly long. I could only\r\nexplain the undiminished zeal of the singers, and particularly of\r\nTichatschek, who seemed to grow lustier and cheerier the longer it\r\nlasted, as an amiable trick to conceal from me the inevitable\r\ncatastrophe. But my astonishment at finding the audience still there in\r\nfull muster, even in the last act—towards midnight—filled me with\r\nimbounded perplexity. I could no longer trust my eyes or ears, and\r\nregarded the whole events of the evening as a nightmare. It was past\r\nmidnight when, for the last time, I had to obey the thunderous calls of\r\nthe audience, side by side with my trusty singers.\r\n\r\nMy feeling of desperation at the unparalleled length of my opera was\r\naugmented by the temper of my relatives, whom I saw for a short time\r\nafter the performance. Friedrich Brockhaus and his family had come over\r\nwith some friends from Leipzig, and had invited us to the inn, hoping\r\nto celebrate an agreeable success over a pleasant supper, and possibly\r\nto drink my health. But on arriving, kitchen and cellar were closed,\r\nand every one was so worn out that nothing was to be heard but outcries\r\nat the unparalleled case of an opera lasting from six o’clock till past\r\ntwelve. No further remarks were exchanged, and we stole away feeling\r\nquite stupefied.\r\n\r\nAbout eight the next morning I put in an appearance at the clerks’\r\noffice, in order that in case there should be a second performance I\r\nmight arrange the necessary curtailment of the parts. If, during the\r\nprevious summer, I had contested every beat with the faithful\r\nchorus-master Fischer, and proved them all to be indispensable, I was\r\nnow possessed by a blind rage for striking out. There was not a single\r\npart of my score which seemed any longer necessary—what the audience\r\nhad been made to swallow the previous evening now appeared but a chaos\r\nof sheer impossibilities, each and all of which might be omitted\r\nwithout the slightest damage or risk of being unintelligible. My one\r\nthought now was how to reduce my convolution of monstrosities to decent\r\nlimits. By dint of unsparing and ruthless abbreviations handed over to\r\nthe copyist, I hoped to avert a catastrophe, for I expected nothing\r\nless than that the general manager, together with the city and the\r\ntheatre, would that very day give me to understand that such a thing as\r\nthe performance of my Last of the Tribunes might perhaps be permitted\r\nonce as a curiosity, but not oftener. All day long, therefore, I\r\ncarefully avoided going near the theatre, so as to give time for my\r\nheroic abbreviations to do their salutary work, and for news of them to\r\nspread through the city. But at midday I looked in again upon the\r\ncopyists, to assure myself that all had been duly performed as I had\r\nordered. I then learned that Tichatschek had also been there, and,\r\nafter inspecting the omissions that I had arranged, had forbidden their\r\nbeing carried out. Fischer, the chorus-master, also wished to speak to\r\nme about them: work was suspended, and I foresaw great confusion. I\r\ncould not understand what it all meant, and feared mischief if the\r\narduous task were delayed. At length, towards evening, I sought out\r\nTichatschek at the theatre. Without giving him a chance to speak, I\r\nbrusquely asked him why he had interrupted the copyists’ work. In a\r\nhalf-choked voice he curtly and defiantly rejoined, ‘I will have none\r\nof my part cut out—it is too heavenly.’ I stared at him blankly, and\r\nthen felt as though I had been suddenly bewitched: such an unheard-of\r\ntestimony to my success could not but shake me out of my strange\r\nanxiety. Others joined him, Fischer radiant with delight and bubbling\r\nwith laughter. Every one spoke of the enthusiastic emotion which\r\nthrilled the whole city. Next came a letter of thanks from the\r\nCommissioner acknowledging my splendid work. Nothing now remained for\r\nme but to embrace Tichatschek and Fischer, and go on my way to inform\r\nMinna and Clara how matters stood.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days’ rest for the actors, the second performance took\r\nplace on 26th October, but with various curtailments, for which I had\r\ngreat difficulty in obtaining Tichatschek’s consent. Although it was\r\nstill of much more than average length, I heard no particular\r\ncomplaints, and at last adopted Tichatschek’s view that, if he could\r\nstand it, so could the audience. For six performances therefore, all of\r\nwhich continued to receive a similar avalanche of applause, I let the\r\nmatter run its course.\r\n\r\nMy opera, however, had also excited interest among the elder princesses\r\nof the royal family. They thought its exhausting length a drawback, but\r\nwere nevertheless unwilling to miss any of it. Lüttichau consequently\r\nproposed that I should give the piece at full length, but half of it at\r\na time on two successive evenings. This suited me very well, and after\r\nan interval of a few weeks we announced Rienzi’s Greatness for the\r\nfirst day, and His Fall for the second. The first evening we gave two\r\nacts, and on the second three, and for the latter I composed a special\r\nintroductory prelude. This met with the entire approval of our august\r\npatrons, and especially of the two eldest, Princesses Amalie and\r\nAugusta. The public, on the contrary, simply regarded this in the light\r\nof now being asked to pay two entrance fees for one opera, and\r\npronounced the new arrangement a decided fraud. Its annoyance at the\r\nchange was so great that it actually threatened to be fatal to the\r\nattendance, and after three performances of the divided Rienzi the\r\nmanagement was obliged to go back to the old arrangement, which I\r\nwillingly made possible by introducing my cuttings again.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the piece used to fill the house to overflowing\r\nas often as it could be presented, and the permanence of its success\r\nbecame still more obvious when I began to realise the envy it drew upon\r\nme from many different quarters. My first experience of this was truly\r\npainful, and came from the hands of the poet, Julius Mosen, on the very\r\nday after the first performance. When I first reached Dresden in the\r\nsummer I had sought him out, and, having a really high opinion of his\r\ntalent, our intercourse soon became more intimate, and was the means of\r\ngiving me much pleasure and instruction. He had shown me a volume of\r\nhis plays, which on the whole appealed to me exceptionally. Among these\r\nwas a tragedy, Cola Rienzi, dealing with the same subject as my opera,\r\nand in a manner partly new to me, and which I thought effective. With\r\nreference to this poem, I had begged him to take no notice of my\r\nlibretto, as in the quality of its poetry it could not possibly bear\r\ncomparison with his own; and it cost him little sacrifice to grant the\r\nrequest. It happened that just before the first performance of my\r\nRienzi, he had produced in Dresden Bernhard von Weimar, one of his\r\nleast happy pieces, the result of which had brought him little\r\npleasure. Dramatically it was a thing with no life in it, aiming only\r\nat political harangue, and had shared the inevitable fate of all such\r\naberrations. He had therefore awaited the appearance of my Rienzi with\r\nsome vexation, and confessed to me his bitter chagrin at not being able\r\nto procure the acceptance of his tragedy of the same name in Dresden.\r\nThis, he presumed, arose from its somewhat pronounced political\r\ntendency, which, certainly in a spoken play on a similar subject, would\r\nbe more noticeable than in an opera, where from the very start no one\r\npays any heed to the words. I had genially confirmed him in this\r\ndepreciation of the subject matter in opera; and was therefore the more\r\nstartled when, on finding him at my sister Louisa’s the day after the\r\nfirst performance, he straightway overwhelmed me with a scornful\r\noutburst of irritation at my success. But he found in me a strange\r\nsense of the essential unreality in opera of such a subject as that\r\nwhich I had just illustrated with so much success in Rienzi, so that,\r\noppressed by a secret sense of shame, I had no serious rejoinder to\r\noffer to his candidly poisonous abuse. My line of defence was not yet\r\nsufficiently clear in my own mind to be available offhand, nor was it\r\nyet backed by so obvious a product of my own peculiar genius that I\r\ncould venture to quote it. Moreover, my first impulse was only one of\r\npity for the unlucky playwright, which I felt all the more constrained\r\nto express, because his burst of fury gave me the inward satisfaction\r\nof knowing that he recognised my great success, of which I was not yet\r\nquite clear myself.\r\n\r\nBut this first performance of Rienzi did far more than this. It gave\r\noccasion for controversy, and made an ever-widening breach between\r\nmyself and the newspaper critics. Herr Karl Bank, who for some time had\r\nbeen the chief musical critic in Dresden, had been known to me before\r\nat Magdeburg, where he once visited me and listened with delight to my\r\nplaying of several fairly long passages from my Liebesverbot. When we\r\nmet again in Dresden, this man could not forgive me for having been\r\nunable to procure him tickets for the first performance of Rienzi. The\r\nsame thing happened with a certain Herr Julius Schladebach, who\r\nlikewise settled in Dresden about that time as a critic. Though I was\r\nalways anxious to be gracious to everybody, yet I felt just then an\r\ninvincible repugnance for showing special deference to any man because\r\nhe was a critic. As time went on, I carried this rule to the point of\r\nalmost systematic rudeness, and was consequently all my life through\r\nthe victim of unprecedented persecution from the press. As yet,\r\nhowever, this ill-will had not become pronounced, for at that time\r\njournalism had not begun to give itself airs in Dresden. There were so\r\nfew contributions sent from there to the outside press that our\r\nartistic doings excited very little notice elsewhere, a fact which was\r\ncertainly not without its disadvantages for me. Thus for the present\r\nthe unpleasant side of my success scarcely affected me at all, and for\r\na brief space I felt myself, for the first and only time in my life, so\r\npleasantly borne along on the breath of general good-will, that all my\r\nformer troubles seemed amply requited.\r\n\r\nFor further and quite unexpected fruits of my success now appeared with\r\nastonishing rapidity, though not so much in the form of material\r\nprofit, which for the present resolved itself into nine hundred marks,\r\npaid me by the General Board as an exceptional fee instead of the usual\r\ntwenty golden louis. Nor did I dare to cherish the hope of selling my\r\nwork advantageously to a publisher, until it had been performed in some\r\nother important towns. But fate willed it, that by the sudden death of\r\nRastrelli, royal director of music, which occurred shortly after the\r\nfirst production of Rienzi, an office should unexpectedly become\r\nvacant, for the filling of which all eyes at once turned to me.\r\n\r\nWhile the negotiations over this matter were slowly proceeding, the\r\nGeneral Board gave proof in another direction of an almost passionate\r\ninterest in my talents. They insisted that the first performance of the\r\nFliegender Holländer should on no account be conceded to the Berlin\r\nopera, but reserved as an honour for Dresden. As the Berlin authorities\r\nraised no obstacle, I very gladly handed over my latest work also to\r\nthe Dresden theatre. If in this I had to dispense with Tichatschek’s\r\nassistance, as there was no leading tenor part in the play, I could\r\ncount all the more surely on the helpful co-operation of\r\nSchroder-Devrient, to whom a worthier task was assigned in the leading\r\nfemale part than that which she had had in Rienzi. I was glad to be\r\nable thus to rely entirely upon her, as she had grown strangely out of\r\nhumour with me, owing to her scanty share in the success of Rienzi. The\r\ncompleteness of my faith in her I proved with an exaggeration by no\r\nmeans advantageous to my own work, by simply forcing the leading male\r\npart on Wachter, a once capable, but now somewhat delicate baritone. He\r\nwas in every respect wholly unsuited to the task, and only accepted it\r\nwith unfeigned hesitation. On submitting my play to my adored prima\r\ndonna, I was much relieved to find that its poetry made a special\r\nappeal to her. Thanks to the genuine personal interest awakened in me\r\nunder very peculiar circumstances by the character and fate of this\r\nexceptional woman, our study of the part of Senta, which often brought\r\nus into close contact, became one of the most thrilling and momentously\r\ninstructive periods of my life.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the great actress, especially when under the influence\r\nof her famous mother, Sophie Schroder, who was just then with her on a\r\nvisit, showed undisguised vexation at my having composed so brilliant a\r\nwork as Rienzi for Dresden without having specifically reserved the\r\nprincipal part for her. Yet the magnanimity of her disposition\r\ntriumphed even over this selfish impulse: she loudly proclaimed me ‘a\r\ngenius,’ and honoured me with that special confidence which, she said,\r\nnone but a genius should enjoy. But when she invited me to become both\r\nthe accomplice and adviser in her really dreadful love affairs, this\r\nconfidence certainly began to have its risky side; nevertheless there\r\nwere at first occasions on which she openly proclaimed herself before\r\nall the world as my friend, making most flattering distinctions in my\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nFirst of all I had to accompany her on a trip to Leipzig, where she was\r\ngiving a concert for her mother’s benefit, which she thought to make\r\nparticularly attractive by including in its programme two selections\r\nfrom Rienzi—the aria of Adriano and the hero’s prayer (the latter sung\r\nby Tichatschek), and both under my personal conductorship. Mendelssohn,\r\nwho was also on very friendly terms with her, had been enticed to this\r\nconcert too, and produced his overture to Ruy Blas, then quite new. It\r\nwas during the two busy days spent on this occasion in Leipzig that I\r\nfirst came into close contact with him, all my previous knowledge of\r\nhim having been limited to a few rare and altogether profitless visits.\r\nAt the house of my brother-in-law, Fritz Brockhaus, he and Devrient\r\ngave us a good deal of music, he playing her accompaniment to a number\r\nof Schubert’s songs. I here became conscious of the peculiar unrest and\r\nexcitement with which this master of music, who, though still young,\r\nhad already reached the zenith of his fame and life’s work, observed or\r\nrather watched me. I could see clearly that he thought but little of a\r\nsuccess in opera, and that merely in Dresden. Doubtless I seemed in his\r\neyes one of a class of musicians to whom he attached no value, and with\r\nwhom he proposed to have no intercourse. Nevertheless my success had\r\ncertain characteristic features, which gave it a more or less alarming\r\naspect. Mendelssohn’s most ardent desire for a long time past had been\r\nto write a successful opera, and it was possible he now felt annoyed\r\nthat, before he had succeeded in doing so, a triumph of this nature\r\nshould suddenly be thrust into his face with blunt brutality, and based\r\nupon a style of music which he might feel justified in regarding as\r\npoor. He probably found it no less exasperating that Devrient, whose\r\ngifts he acknowledged, and who was his own devoted admirer, should now\r\nso openly and loudly sound my praises. These thoughts were dimly\r\nshaping themselves in my mind, when Mendelssohn, by a very remarkable\r\nstatement, drove me, almost with violence, to adopt this\r\ninterpretation. On our way home together, after the joint concert\r\nrehearsal, I was talking very warmly on the subject of music. Although\r\nby no means a talkative man, he suddenly interrupted me with curiously\r\nhasty excitement by the assertion that music had but one great fault,\r\nnamely, that more than any other art it stimulated not only our good,\r\nbut also our evil qualities, such, for instance, as jealousy. I blushed\r\nwith shame to have to apply this speech to his own feelings towards me;\r\nfor I was profoundly conscious of my innocence of ever having dreamed,\r\neven in the remotest degree, of placing my own talents or performances\r\nas a musician in comparison with his. Yet, strange to say, at this very\r\nconcert he showed himself in a light by no means calculated to place\r\nhim beyond all possibility of comparison with myself. A rendering of\r\nhis Hebrides Overture would have placed him so immeasurably above my\r\ntwo operatic airs, that all shyness at having to stand beside him would\r\nhave been spared me, as the gulf between our two productions was\r\nimpassable. But in his choice of the Ruy Blas Overture he appears to\r\nhave been prompted by a desire to place himself on this occasion so\r\nclose to the operatic style that its effectiveness might be reflected\r\nupon his own work. The overture was evidently calculated for a Parisian\r\naudience, and the astonishment Mendelssohn caused by appearing in such\r\na connection was shown by Robert Schumann in his own ungainly fashion\r\nat its close. Approaching the musician in the orchestra, he blandly,\r\nand with a genial smile, expressed his admiration of the ‘brilliant\r\norchestral piece’ just played..\r\n\r\nBut in the interests of veracity let me not forget that neither he nor\r\nI scored the real success of that evening. We were both wholly eclipsed\r\nby the tremendous effect produced by the grey-haired Sophie Schroder in\r\na recitation of Burger’s Lenore. While the daughter had been taunted in\r\nthe newspapers with unfairly employing all sorts of musical attractions\r\nto cozen a benefit concert out of the music lovers of Leipzig for a\r\nmother who never had anything to do with that art, we, who were there\r\nas her musical aiders and abettors, had to stand like so many idle\r\nconjurers, while this aged and almost toothless dame declaimed Burger’s\r\npoem with truly terrifying beauty and grandeur. This episode, like so\r\nmuch else that I saw during these few days, gave me abundant food for\r\nthought and meditation.\r\n\r\nA second excursion, also undertaken with Devrient, took me in the\r\nDecember of that year to Berlin, where the singer had been invited to\r\nappear at a grand state concert. I for my part wanted an interview with\r\nDirector Küstner about the Fliegender Holländer. Although I arrived at\r\nno definite result regarding my own personal business, this short visit\r\nto Berlin was memorable for my meeting with Franz Liszt, which\r\nafterwards proved of great importance. It took place under singular\r\ncircumstances, which placed both him and me in a situation of peculiar\r\nembarrassment, brought about in the most wanton fashion by Devrient’s\r\nexasperating caprice.\r\n\r\nI had already told my patroness the story of my earlier meeting with\r\nLiszt. During that fateful second winter of my stay in Paris, when I\r\nhad at last been driven to be grateful for Schlesinger’s hack-work, I\r\none day received word from Laube, who always bore me in mind, that F.\r\nLiszt was coming to Paris. He had mentioned and recommended me to him\r\nwhen he was in Germany, and advised me to lose no time in looking him\r\nup, as he was ‘generous,’ and would certainly find means of helping me.\r\nAs soon as I heard that he had really arrived, I presented myself at\r\nthe hotel to see him. It was early in the morning. On my entrance I\r\nfound several strange gentlemen waiting in the drawing-room, where,\r\nafter some time, we were joined by Liszt himself, pleasant and affable,\r\nand wearing his indoor coat. The conversation was carried on in French,\r\nand turned upon his experiences during his last professional journey in\r\nHungary. As I was unable to take part, on account of the language, I\r\nlistened for some time, feeling heartily bored, until at last he asked\r\nme pleasantly what he could do for me. He seemed unable to recall\r\nLaube’s recommendation, and all the answer I could give was that I\r\ndesired to make his acquaintance. To this he had evidently no\r\nobjection, and informed me he would take care to have a ticket sent me\r\nfor his great matinee, which was to take place shortly. My sole attempt\r\nto introduce an artistic theme of conversation was a question as to\r\nwhether he knew Lowe’s Erlkonig as well as Schubert’s. His reply in the\r\nnegative frustrated this somewhat awkward attempt, and I ended my visit\r\nby giving him my address. Thither his secretary, Belloni, presently\r\nsent me, with a few polite words, a card of admission to a concert to\r\nbe given entirely by the master himself in the Salle Erard. I duly\r\nwended my way to the overcrowded hall, and beheld the platform on which\r\nthe grand piano stood, closely beleaguered by the cream of Parisian\r\nfemale society, and witnessed their enthusiastic ovations of this\r\nvirtuoso, who was at that time the wonder of the world. Moreover, I\r\nheard several of his most brilliant pieces, such as ‘Variations on\r\nRobert le Diable,’ but carried away with me no real impression beyond\r\nthat of being stunned. This took place just at the time when I\r\nabandoned a path which had been contrary to my truer nature, and had\r\nled me astray, and on which I now emphatically turned my back in silent\r\nbitterness. I was therefore in no fitting mood for a just appreciation\r\nof this prodigy, who at that time was shining in the blazing light of\r\nday, but from whom I had turned my face to the night. I went to see\r\nLiszt no more.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, I had given Devrient a bare outline of this\r\nstory, but she had noted it with particular attention, for I happened\r\nto have touched her weak point of professional jealousy. As Liszt had\r\nalso been commanded by the King of Prussia to appear at the grand state\r\nconcert at Berlin, it so happened that the first time they met Liszt\r\nquestioned her with great interest about the success of Rienzi. She\r\nthereupon observed that the composer of that opera was an altogether\r\nunknown man, and proceeded with curious malice to taunt him with his\r\napparent lack of penetration, as proved by the fact that the said\r\ncomposer, who now so keenly excited his interest, was the very same\r\npoor musician whom he had lately ‘turned away so contemptuously’ in\r\nParis. All this she told me with an air of triumph, which distressed me\r\nvery much, and I at once set to work to correct the false impression\r\nconveyed by my former account. As we were still debating this point in\r\nher room, we were startled by hearing from the next the famous bass\r\npart in the ‘Revenge’ air from Donna Anna, rapidly executed in octaves\r\non the piano. ‘That’s Liszt himself,’ she cried. Liszt then entered the\r\nroom to fetch her for the rehearsal. To my great embarrassment she\r\nintroduced me to him with malicious delight as the composer of Rienzi,\r\nthe man whose acquaintance he now wished to make after having\r\npreviously shown him the door in his glorious Paris. My solemn\r\nasseverations that my patroness—no doubt only in fun—was deliberately\r\ndistorting my account of my former visit to him, apparently pacified\r\nhim so far as I was concerned, and, on the other hand, he had no doubt\r\nalready formed his own opinion of the impulsive singer. He certainly\r\nregretted that he could not remember my visit in Paris, but it\r\nnevertheless shocked and alarmed him to learn that any one should have\r\nhad reason to complain of such treatment at his hands. The hearty\r\nsincerity of Listz’s simple words to me about this misunderstanding, as\r\ncontrasted with the strangely passionate raillery of the incorrigible\r\nlady, made a most pleasing and captivating impression upon me. The\r\nwhole bearing of the man, and the way in which he tried to ward off the\r\npitiless scorn of her attacks, was something new to me, and gave me a\r\ndeep insight into his character, so firm in its amiability and\r\nboundless good-nature. Finally, she teased him about the Doctor’s\r\ndegree which had just been conferred on him by the University of\r\nKönigsberg, and pretended to mistake him for a chemist. At last he\r\nstretched himself out flat on the floor, and implored her mercy,\r\ndeclaring himself quite defenceless against the storm of her invective.\r\nThen turning to me with a hearty assurance that he would make it his\r\nbusiness to hear Rienzi, and would in any case endeavour to give me a\r\nbetter opinion of himself than his evil star had hitherto permitted, we\r\nparted for that occasion.\r\n\r\nThe almost naive simplicity and naturalness of his every phrase and\r\nword, and particularly his emphatic manner, left a most profound\r\nimpression upon me. No one could fail to be equally affected by these\r\nqualities, and I now realised for the first time the almost magic power\r\nexerted by Liszt over all who came in close contact with him, and saw\r\nhow erroneous had been my former opinion as to its cause.\r\n\r\nThese two excursions to Leipzig and Berlin found but brief\r\ninterruptions of the period devoted at home to our study of the\r\nFliegender Holländer. It was therefore, of paramount importance to me\r\nto maintain Schroder-Devrient’s keen interest in her part, since, in\r\nview of the weakness of the rest of the cast, I was convinced that it\r\nwas from her alone I could expect any adequate interpretation of the\r\nspirit of my work.\r\n\r\nThe part of Senta was essentially suited to her, and there were just at\r\nthat moment peculiar circumstances in her life which brought her\r\nnaturally emotional temperament to a high pitch of tension. I was\r\namazed when she confided to me that she was on the point of breaking\r\noff a regular liaison of many years’ standing, to form, in passionate\r\nhaste, another much less desirable one. The forsaken lover, who was\r\ntenderly devoted to her, was a young lieutenant in the Royal Guards,\r\nand the son of Muller, the ex-Minister of Education; her new choice,\r\nwhose acquaintance she had formed on a recent visit to Berlin, was Herr\r\nvon Munchhausen. He was a tall, slim young man, and her predilection\r\nfor him was easily explained when I became more closely acquainted with\r\nher love affairs. It seemed to me that the bestowal of her confidence\r\non me in this matter arose from her guilty conscience; she was aware\r\nthat Muller, whom I liked on account of his excellent disposition, had\r\nloved her with the earnestness of a first love, and also that she was\r\nnow betraying him in the most faithless way on a trivial pretext. She\r\nmust have known that her new lover was entirely unworthy of her, and\r\nthat his intentions were frivolous and selfish. She knew, too, that no\r\none, and certainly none of her older friends who knew her best, would\r\napprove of her behaviour. She told me candidly that she had felt\r\nimpelled to confide in me because I was a genius, and would understand\r\nthe demands of her temperament. I hardly knew what to think. I was\r\nrepelled alike by her passion and the circumstances attending it; but\r\nto my astonishment I had to confess that the infatuation, so repulsive\r\nto me, held this strange woman in so powerful a grasp that I could not\r\nrefuse her a certain amount of pity, nay, even real sympathy.\r\n\r\nShe was pale and distraught, ate hardly anything, and her faculties\r\nwere subjected to a strain so extraordinary that I thought she would\r\nnot escape a serious, perhaps a fatal illness. Sleep had long since\r\ndeserted her, and whenever I brought her my unlucky Fliegender\r\nHolländer, her looks so alarmed me that the proposed rehearsal was the\r\nlast thing I thought of. But in this matter she insisted; she made me\r\nsit down at the piano, and then plunged into the study of her role as\r\nif it were a matter of life and death. She found the actual learning of\r\nthe part very difficult, and it was only by repeated and persevering\r\nrehearsal that she mastered her task. She would sing for hours at a\r\ntime with such passion that I often sprang up in terror and begged her\r\nto spare herself; then she would point smiling to her chest, and expand\r\nthe muscles of her still magnificent person, to assure me that she was\r\ndoing herself no harm. Her voice really acquired at that time a\r\nyouthful freshness and power of endurance. I had to confess that which\r\noften astonished me: this infatuation for an insipid nobody was very\r\nmuch to the advantage of my Senta. Her courage under this intense\r\nstrain was so great that, as time pressed, she consented to have the\r\ngeneral rehearsal on the very day of the first performance, and a delay\r\nwhich would have been greatly to my disadvantage was thus avoided.\r\n\r\nThe performance took place on 2nd January, in the year 1843. Its result\r\nwas extremely instructive to me, and led to the turning-point of my\r\ncareer. The ill-success of the performance taught me how much care and\r\nforethought were essential to secure the adequate dramatic\r\ninterpretation of my latest works. I realised that I had more or less\r\nbelieved that my score would explain itself, and that my singers would\r\narrive at the right interpretation of their own accord. My good old\r\nfriend Wachter, who at the time of Henriette Sontag’s first success was\r\na favourite ‘Barber of Seville,’ had from the first discreetly thought\r\notherwise. Unfortunately, even Schroder-Devrient only saw when the\r\nrehearsals were too far advanced how utterly incapable Wachter was of\r\nrealising the horror and supreme suffering of my Mariner. His\r\ndistressing corpulence, his broad fat face, the extraordinary movements\r\nof his arms and legs, which he managed to make look like mere stumps,\r\ndrove my passionate Senta to despair. At one rehearsal, when in the\r\ngreat scene in Act ii. she comes to him in the guise of a guardian\r\nangel to bring the message of salvation, she broke off to whisper\r\ndespairingly in my ear, ‘How can I say it when I look into those beady\r\neyes? Good God, Wagner, what a muddle you have made!’ I consoled her as\r\nwell as I could, and secretly placed my dependence on Herr von\r\nMunchhausen, who promised faithfully to sit that evening in the front\r\nrow of the stalls, so that Devrient’s eyes must fall on him. And the\r\nmagnificent performance of my great artiste, although she stood\r\nhorribly alone on the stage, did succeed in rousing enthusiasm in the\r\nsecond act. The first act offered the audience nothing but a dull\r\nconversation between Herr Wachter and that Herr Risse who had invited\r\nme to an excellent glass of wine on the first night of Rienzi, and in\r\nthe third the loudest raging of the orchestra did not rouse the sea\r\nfrom its dead calm nor the phantom ship in its cautious rocking. The\r\naudience fell to wondering how I could have produced this crude,\r\nmeagre, and gloomy work after Rienzi, in every act of which incident\r\nabounded, and Tichatschek shone in an endless variety of costumes.\r\n\r\nAs Schroder-Devrient soon left Dresden for a considerable time, the\r\nFliegender Holländer saw only four performances, at which the\r\ndiminishing audiences made it plain that I had not pleased Dresden\r\ntaste with it. The management was compelled to revive Rienzi in order\r\nto maintain my prestige; and the triumph of this opera compared with\r\nthe failure of the Dutchman gave me food for reflection. I had to\r\nadmit, with some misgivings, that the success of my Rienzi was not\r\nentirely due to the cast and staging, although I was fully alive to the\r\ndefects from which the Fliegender Holländer suffered in this respect.\r\nAlthough Wachter was far from realising my conception of the Fliegender\r\nHolländer I could not conceal from myself the fact that Tichatschek was\r\nquite as far removed from the ideal Rienzi. His abominable errors and\r\ndeficiencies in his presentation of the part had never escaped me; he\r\nhad never been able to lay aside his brilliant and heroic leading-tenor\r\nmanners in order to render that gloomy demonic strain in Rienzi’s\r\ntemperament on which I had laid unmistakable stress at the critical\r\npoints of the drama. In the fourth act, after the pronouncement of the\r\ncurse, he fell on his knees in the most melancholy fashion and\r\nabandoned himself to bewailing his fate in piteous tones. When I\r\nsuggested to him that Rienzi, though inwardly despairing, must take up\r\nan attitude of statuesque firmness before the world, he pointed out to\r\nme the great popularity which the end of this very act had won as\r\ninterpreted by himself, with an intimation that he intended making no\r\nchange in it.\r\n\r\nAnd when I considered the real causes of the success of Rienzi, I found\r\nthat it rested on the brilliant and extraordinarily fresh voice of the\r\nsoaring, happy singer, in the refreshing effect of the chorus and the\r\ngay movement and colouring on the stage. I received a still more\r\nconvincing proof of this when we divided the opera into two, and found\r\nthat the second part, which was the more important from both the\r\ndramatic and the musical point of view, was noticeably less well\r\nattended than the first, for the very obvious reason, as I thought,\r\nthat the ballet occurred in the first part. My brother Julius, who had\r\ncome over from Leipzig for one of the performances of Rienzi, gave me a\r\nstill more naive testimony as to the real point of interest in the\r\nopera. I was sitting with him in an open box, in full sight of the\r\naudience, and had therefore begged him to desist from giving any\r\napplause, even if directed only to the efforts of the singers; he\r\nrestrained himself all through the evening, but his enthusiasm at a\r\ncertain figure of the ballet was too much for him, and he clapped\r\nloudly, to the great amusement of the audience, telling me that he\r\ncould not hold himself in any longer. Curiously enough, this same\r\nballet secured for Rienzi, which was otherwise received with\r\nindifference, the enduring preference of the present King of\r\nPrussia,[11]     who many years afterwards ordered the revival of this\r\nopera, although it had utterly failed in arousing public interest by\r\nits merits as a drama.\r\n\r\n [11] William the First.\r\n\r\n\r\nI found, when I had to be present later on at a representation of the\r\nsame opera at Darmstadt, that while wholesale cuts had to be made in\r\nits best parts, it had been found necessary to expand the ballets by\r\nadditions and repetitions. This ballet music, which I had put together\r\nwith contemptuous haste at Riga in a few days without any inspiration,\r\nseemed to me, moreover, so strikingly weak that I was thoroughly\r\nashamed of it even in those days at Dresden, when I had found myself\r\ncompelled to suppress its best feature, the tragic pantomime. Further,\r\nthe resources of the ballet in Dresden did not even admit of the\r\nexecution of my stage directions for the combat in the arena, nor for\r\nthe very significant round dances, both admirably carried out at a\r\nlater date in Berlin. I had to be content with the humiliating\r\nsubstitution of a long, foolish step-dance by two insignificant\r\ndancers, which was ended by a company of soldiers marching on, bearing\r\ntheir shields on high so as to form a roof and remind the audience of\r\nthe Roman testudo; then the ballet-master with his assistant, in\r\nflesh-coloured tights, leaped on to the shields and turned somersaults,\r\na proceeding which they thought was reminiscent of the gladiatorial\r\ngames. It was at this point that the house was always moved to\r\nresounding applause, and I had to own that this moment marked the\r\nclimax of my success.\r\n\r\nI thus had my doubts as to the intrinsic divergence between my inner\r\naims and my outward success; at the same time a decisive and fatal\r\nchange in my fortunes was brought about by my acceptance of the\r\nconductorship at Dresden, under circumstances as perplexing in their\r\nway as those preceding my marriage. I had met the negotiations which\r\nled up to this appointment with a hesitation and a coolness by no means\r\naffected. I felt nothing but scorn for theatrical life; a scorn that\r\nwas by no means lessened by a closer acquaintance with the apparently\r\ndistinguished ruling body of a court theatre, the splendours of which\r\nonly conceal, with arrogant ignorance, the humiliating conditions\r\nappertaining to it and to the modern theatre in general. I saw every\r\nnoble impulse stifled in those occupied with theatrical matters, and a\r\ncombination of the vainest and most frivolous interests maintained by a\r\nridiculously rigid and bureaucratic system; I was now fully convinced\r\nthat the necessity of handling the business of the theatre would be the\r\nmost distasteful thing I could imagine. Now that, through Rastrelli’s\r\ndeath, the temptation to be false to my inner conviction came to me in\r\nDresden, I explained to my old and trusted friends that I did not think\r\nI should accept the vacant post.\r\n\r\nBut everything calculated to shake human resolution combined against\r\nthis decision. The prospect of securing the means of livelihood through\r\na permanent position with a fixed salary was an irresistible\r\nattraction. I combated the temptation by reminding myself of my success\r\nas an operatic composer, which might reasonably be expected to bring in\r\nenough to supply my moderate requirements in a lodging of two rooms,\r\nwhere I could proceed undisturbed with fresh compositions. I was told\r\nin answer to this that my work itself would be better served by a fixed\r\nposition without arduous duties, as for a whole year since the\r\ncompletion of the Fliegender Holländer I had not, under existing\r\ncircumstances, found any leisure at all for composition. I still\r\nremained convinced that Rastrelli’s post of musical director, in\r\nsubordination to the conductor, was unworthy of me, and I declined to\r\nentertain the proposal, thus leaving the management to look elsewhere\r\nfor some one to fill the vacancy.\r\n\r\nThere was therefore no further question of this particular post, but I\r\nwas then informed that the death of Morlacchi had left vacant a court\r\nconductorship, and it was thought that the King would be willing to\r\noffer me the post. My wife was very much excited at this prospect, for\r\nin Germany the greatest value is laid on these court appointments,\r\nwhich are tenable for life, and the dazzling respectability pertaining\r\nto them is held out to German musicians as the acme of earthly\r\nhappiness. The offer opened up for us in many directions the prospect\r\nof friendly relations in a society which had hitherto been outside our\r\nexperience. Domestic comfort and social prestige were very alluring to\r\nthe homeless wanderers who, in bygone days of misery, had often longed\r\nfor the comfort and security of an assured and permanent position such\r\nas was now open to them under the august protection of the court. The\r\ninfluence of Caroline von Weber did much in the long-run to weaken my\r\nopposition. I was often at her house, and took great pleasure in her\r\nsociety, which brought back to my mind very vividly the personality of\r\nmy still dearly beloved master. She begged me with really touching\r\ntenderness not to withstand this obvious command of fate, and asserted\r\nher right to ask me to settle in Dresden, to fill the place left sadly\r\nempty by her husband’s death. ‘Just think,’ she said, ‘how can I look\r\nWeber in the face again when I join him if I have to tell him that the\r\nwork for which he made such devoted sacrifices in Dresden is neglected;\r\njust imagine my feelings when I see that indolent Reissiger stand in my\r\nnoble Weber’s place, and when I hear his operas produced more\r\nmechanically every year. If you loved Weber, you owe it to his memory\r\nto step into his place and to continue his work.’ As an experienced\r\nwoman of the world she also pointed out energetically and prudently the\r\npractical side of the matter, impressing on me the duty of thinking of\r\nmy wife, who would, in case of my death, be sufficiently provided for\r\nif I accepted the post.\r\n\r\nThe promptings of affection, prudence and good sense, however, had less\r\nweight with me than the enthusiastic conviction, never at any period of\r\nmy life entirely destroyed, that wherever fate led me, whether to\r\nDresden or elsewhere, I should find the opportunity which would convert\r\nmy dreams into reality through currents set in motion by some change in\r\nthe everyday order of events. All that was needed for this was the\r\nadvent of an ardent and aspiring soul who, with good luck to back him,\r\nmight make up for lost time, and by his ennobling influence achieve the\r\ndeliverance of art from her shameful bonds. The wonderful and rapid\r\nchange which had taken place in my fortunes could not fail to encourage\r\nsuch a hope, and I was seduced on perceiving the marked alteration that\r\nhad taken place in the whole attitude of Lüttichau, the general\r\ndirector, towards me. This strange individual showed me a kindliness of\r\nwhich no one would hitherto have thought him capable, and that he was\r\nprompted by a genuine feeling of personal benevolence towards me I\r\ncould not help being absolutely convinced, even at the time of my\r\nsubsequent ceaseless differences with him.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the decision came as a kind of surprise. On 2nd February\r\n1843 I was very politely invited to the director’s office, and there\r\nmet the general staff of the royal orchestra, in whose presence\r\nLüttichau, through the medium of my never-to-be-forgotten friend\r\nWinkler, solemnly read out to me a royal rescript appointing me\r\nforthwith conductor to his Majesty, with a life salary of four thousand\r\nfive hundred marks a year. Lüttichau followed the reading of this\r\ndocument by a more or less ceremonious speech, in which he assumed that\r\nI should gratefully accept the King’s favour. At this polite ceremony\r\nit did not escape my notice that all possibility of future negotiations\r\nover the figure of the salary was cut off; on the other hand, a\r\nsubstantial exemption in my favour, the omission of the condition,\r\nenforced even on Weber in his time, of serving a year’s probation under\r\nthe title of mere musical director, was calculated to secure my\r\nunconditional acceptance. My new colleagues congratulated me, and\r\nLüttichau accompanied me with the politest phrases to my own door,\r\nwhere I fell into the arms of my poor wife, who was giddy with delight.\r\nTherefore I fully realised that I must put the best face I could on the\r\nmatter, and unless I wished to give unheard-of offence, I must even\r\ncongratulate myself on my appointment as royal conductor.\r\n\r\nA few days after taking the oath as a servant of the King in solemn\r\nsession, and undergoing the ceremony of presentation to the assembled\r\norchestra by means of an enthusiastic speech from the general director,\r\nI was summoned to an audience with his Majesty. When I saw the features\r\nof the kind, courteous, and homely monarch, I involuntarily thought of\r\nmy youthful attempt at a political overture on the theme of Friedrich\r\nund Freiheit. Our somewhat embarrassed conversation brightened with the\r\nKing’s expression of his satisfaction with those two of my operas which\r\nhad been performed in Dresden. He expressed with polite hesitation his\r\nfeeling that if my operas left anything to be desired, it was a clearer\r\ndefinition of the various characters in my musical dramas. He thought\r\nthe interest in the persons was overpowered by the elemental forces\r\nfiguring beside them—in Hienzi the mob, in the Fliegender Holländer the\r\nsea. I thought I understood his meaning perfectly, and this proof of\r\nhis sincere sympathy and original judgment pleased me very much. He\r\nalso made his excuses in advance for a possible rare attendance at my\r\noperas on his part, his sole reason for this being that he had a\r\npeculiar aversion from theatre-going, as the result of one of the rules\r\nof his early training, under which he and his brother John, who had\r\nacquired a similar aversion, were for a long time compelled regularly\r\nto attend the theatre, when he, to tell the truth, would often have\r\npreferred to be left alone to follow his own pursuits independent of\r\netiquette.\r\n\r\nAs a characteristic instance of the courtier spirit, I afterwards\r\nlearned that Lüttichau, who had had to wait for me in the anteroom\r\nduring this audience, had been very much put out by its long duration.\r\nIn the whole course of my life I was only admitted twice more to\r\npersonal intercourse and speech with the good King. The first occasion\r\nwas when I presented him with the dedication copy of the pianoforte\r\nscore of my Rienzi; and the second was after my very successful\r\narrangement and performance of the Iphigenia in Aulis, by Gluck, of\r\nwhose operas he was particularly fond, when he stopped me in the public\r\npromenade and congratulated me on my work.\r\n\r\nThat first audience with the King marked the zenith of my hastily\r\nadopted career at Dresden; thenceforward anxiety reasserted itself in\r\nmanifold ways. I very quickly realised the difficulties of my material\r\nsituation, since it soon became evident that the advantage won by new\r\nexertions and my present appointment bore no proportion to the heavy\r\nsacrifices and obligations which I incurred as soon as I entered on an\r\nindependent career. The young musical director of Riga, long since\r\nforgotten, suddenly reappeared in an astonishing reincarnation as royal\r\nconductor to the King of Saxony. The first-fruits of the universal\r\nestimate of my good fortune took the shape of pressing creditors and\r\nthreats of prosecution; next followed demands from the Königsberg\r\ntradesmen, from whom I had escaped from Riga by means of that horribly\r\nwretched and miserable flight. I also heard from people in the most\r\ndistant parts, who thought they had some claim on me, dating even from\r\nmy student, nay, my school days, until at last I cried out in my\r\nastonishment that I expected to receive a bill next from the nurse who\r\nhad suckled me. All this did not amount to any very large sum, and I\r\nmerely mention it because of the ill-natured rumours which, I learned\r\nyears later, had been spread abroad about the extent of my debts at\r\nthat time. Out of three thousand marks, borrowed at interest from\r\nSchroder-Devrient, I not only paid these debts, but also fully\r\ncompensated the sacrifices which Kietz had made on my behalf, without\r\never expecting any return, in the days of my poverty in Paris. I was,\r\nmoreover, able to be of practical use to him. But where was I to find\r\neven this sum, as my distress had hitherto been so great that I was\r\nobliged to urge Schroder-Devrient to hurry on the rehearsals of the\r\nFliegender Holländer by pointing out to her the enormous importance to\r\nme of the fee for the performance? I had no allowance for the expenses\r\nof my establishment in Dresden, though it had to be suitable for my\r\nposition as royal conductor, nor even for the purchase of a ridiculous\r\nand expensive court uniform, so that there would have been no\r\npossibility of my making a start at all, as I had no private means,\r\nunless I borrowed money at interest.\r\n\r\nBut no one who knew of the extraordinary success of Rienzi at Dresden\r\ncould help believing in an immediate and remunerative rage for my\r\noperas on the German stage. My own relatives, even the prudent Ottilie,\r\nwere so convinced of it that they thought I might safely count on at\r\nleast doubling my salary by the receipts from my operas. At the very\r\nbeginning the prospects did indeed seem bright; the score of my\r\nFliegender Holländer was ordered by the Royal Theatre at Cassel and by\r\nthe Riga theatre, which I had known so well in the old days, because\r\nthey were anxious to perform something of mine at an early date, and\r\nhad heard that this opera was on a smaller scale, and made smaller\r\ndemands on the stage management, than Rienzi. In May, 1843 I heard good\r\nreports of the success of the performances from both those places. But\r\nthis was all for the time being, and a whole year went by without the\r\nsmallest inquiry for any of my scores. An attempt was made to secure me\r\nsome benefit by the publication of the pianoforte score of the\r\nFliegender Holländer, as I wanted to reserve Rienzi, after the\r\nsuccesses it had gained, as useful capital for a more favourable\r\nopportunity; but the plan was spoilt by the opposition of Messrs.\r\nHartel of Leipzig, who, although ready enough to publish my opera,\r\nwould only do so on the condition that I abstained from asking any\r\npayment for it.\r\n\r\nSo I had, for the present, to content myself with the moral\r\nsatisfaction of my successes, of which my unmistakable popularity with\r\nthe Dresden public, and the respect and attention paid to me, formed\r\npart. But even in this respect my Utopian dreams were destined to be\r\ndisturbed. I think that my appearance at Dresden marked the beginning\r\nof a new era in journalism and criticism, which found food for its\r\nhitherto but slightly developed vitality in its vexation at my success.\r\nThe two gentlemen I have already mentioned, C. Bank and J. Schladebach,\r\nhad, as I now know, first taken up their regular abode in Dresden at\r\nthat time; I know that when difficulties were raised about the\r\npermanence of Bank’s appointment, they were waived, owing to the\r\ntestimonials and recommendation of my present colleague Reissiger. The\r\nsuccess of my Rienzi had been the source of great annoyance to these\r\ngentlemen, who were now established as musical critics to the Dresden\r\npress, because I made no effort to win their favour; they were not\r\nill-pleased, therefore, to find an opportunity of pouring out the\r\nvitriol of their hatred over the universally popular young musician who\r\nhad won the sympathy of the kindly public, partly on account of the\r\npoverty and ill-luck which had hitherto been his lot. The need for any\r\nkind of human consideration had suddenly vanished with my ‘unheard-of’\r\nappointment to the royal conductorship. Now ‘all was well with me,’\r\n‘too well,’ in fact; and envy found its congenial food; this provided a\r\nperfectly clear and comprehensible point of attack; and soon there\r\nspread through the German press, in the columns given to Dresden news,\r\nan estimate of me which has never fundamentally changed, except in one\r\npoint, to this day. This single modification, which was purely\r\ntemporary and confined to papers of one political colour, occurred on\r\nmy first settlement as a political refugee in Switzerland, but lasted\r\nonly until, through Liszt’s exertions, my operas began to be produced\r\nall over Germany, in spite of my exile. The orders from two theatres,\r\nimmediately after the Dresden performance, for one of my scores, were\r\nmerely due to the fact that up to that time the activity of my\r\njournalistic critics was still limited. I put down the cessation of all\r\ninquiries, certainly not without due justification, mainly to the\r\neffect of the false and calumnious reports in the papers.\r\n\r\nMy old friend Laube tried, indeed, to undertake my defence in the\r\npress. On New Year’s Day, 1843 he resumed the editorship of the Zeitung\r\nfur die Elegante Welt, and asked me to provide him with a biographical\r\nnotice of myself for the first number. It evidently gave him great\r\npleasure to present me thus in triumph to the literary world, and in\r\norder to give the subject more prominence he added a supplement to that\r\nnumber in the shape of a lithograph reproduction of my portrait by\r\nKietz. But after a time even he became anxious and confused in his\r\njudgment of my works, when he saw the systematic and increasingly\r\nvirulent detraction, depreciation, and scorn to which they were\r\nsubjected. He confessed to me later that he had never imagined such a\r\ndesperate position as mine against the united forces of journalism\r\ncould possibly exist, and when he heard my view of the question, he\r\nsmiled and gave me his blessing, as though I were a lost soul.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a change was observable in the attitude of those immediately\r\nconnected with me in my work, and this provided very acceptable\r\nmaterial for the journalistic campaign. I had been led, though by no\r\nambitious impulse, to ask to be allowed to conduct the performances of\r\nmy own works. I found that at every performance of Rienzi Reissiger\r\nbecame more negligent in his conducting, and that the whole production\r\nwas slipping back into the old familiar, expressionless, and humdrum\r\nperformance; and as my appointment was already mooted, I had asked\r\npermission to conduct the sixth performance of my work in person. I\r\nconducted without having held a single rehearsal, and without any\r\nprevious experience, at the head of the Dresden orchestra. The\r\nperformance went splendidly; singers and orchestra were inspired with\r\nnew life, and everybody was obliged to admit that this was the finest\r\nperformance of Rienzi that had yet been given. The rehearsing and\r\ncon-ducting of the Fliegender Holländer were willingly handed over to\r\nme, because Reissiger was overwhelmed with work, in consequence of the\r\ndeath of the musical director, Rastrelli. In addition to this I was\r\nasked to conduct Weber’s Euryanthe, by way of providing a direct proof\r\nof my capacity to interpret scores other than my own. Apparently\r\neverybody was pleased, and it was the tone of this performance that\r\nmade Weber’s widow so anxious that I should accept the Dresden\r\nconductorship; she declared that for the first time since her husband’s\r\ndeath she had heard his work correctly interpreted, both in expression\r\nand time.\r\n\r\nThereupon, Reissiger, who would have preferred to have a musical\r\ndirector under him, but had received instead a colleague on an equal\r\nfooting, felt himself aggrieved by my appointment. Though his own\r\nindolence would have inclined him to the side of peace and a good\r\nunderstanding with me, his ambitious wife took care to stir up his fear\r\nof me. This never led to an openly hostile attitude on his part, but I\r\nnoticed certain indiscretions in the press from that time onwards,\r\nwhich showed me that the friendliness of my colleague, who never talked\r\nto me without first embracing me, was not of the most honourable type.\r\n\r\nI also received a quite unexpected proof that I had attracted the\r\nbitter envy of another man whose sentiments I had no reason to suspect.\r\nThis was Karl Lipinsky, a celebrated violinist in his day, who had for\r\nmany years led the Dresden orchestra. He was a man of ardent\r\ntemperament and original talent, but of incredible vanity, which his\r\nemotional, suspicious Polish temperament rendered dangerous. I always\r\nfound him annoying, because however inspiring and instructive his\r\nplaying was as to the technical execution of the violinists, he was\r\ncertainly ill-fitted to be the leader of a first-class orchestra. This\r\nextraordinary person tried to justify Director Lüttichau’s praise of\r\nhis playing, which could always be heard above the rest of the\r\norchestra; he came in a little before the other violins; he was a\r\nleader in a double sense, as he was always a little ahead. He acted in\r\nmuch the same way with regard to expression, marking his slight\r\nvariations in the piano passages with fanatical precision. It was\r\nuseless to talk to him about it, as nothing but the most skilful\r\nflattery had any effect on him. So I had to endure it as best I could,\r\nand to think out ways and means of diminishing its ill effects on the\r\norchestral performances as a whole by having recourse to the most\r\npolite circumlocutions. Even so he could not endure the higher\r\nestimation in which the performances of the orchestra under my\r\nconductorship were held, because he thought that the playing of an\r\norchestra in which he was the leader must invariably be excellent,\r\nwhoever stood at the conductor’s desk. Now it happened, as is always\r\nthe case when a new man with fresh ideas is installed in office, that\r\nthe members of the orchestra came to me with the most varied\r\nsuggestions for improvements which had hitherto been neglected; and\r\nLipinsky, who was already annoyed about this, turned a certain case of\r\nthis kind to a peculiarly treacherous use. One of the oldest\r\ncontrabassists had died. Lipinsky urged me to arrange that the post\r\nshould not be filled in the usual way by promotion from the ranks of\r\nour own orchestra, but should be given, on his recommendation, to a\r\ndistinguished and skilful contrabassist from Darmstadt named Muller.\r\nWhen the musician whose rights of seniority were thus threatened,\r\nappealed to me, I kept my promise to Lipinsky, explained my views about\r\nthe abuses of promotion by seniority, and declared that, in accordance\r\nwith my sworn oath to the King, I held it my paramount duty to consider\r\nthe maintenance of the artistic interests of the institution before\r\neverything else. I then found to my great astonishment, though it was\r\nfoolish of me to be surprised, that the whole of the orchestra turned\r\nupon me as one man, and when the occasion arose for a discussion\r\nbetween Lipinsky and myself as to his own numerous grievances, he\r\nactually accused me of having threatened, by my remarks in the\r\ncontrabassist case, to undermine the well-established rights of the\r\nmembers of the orchestra, whose welfare it was my duty to protect.\r\nLüttichau, who was on the point of absenting himself from Dresden for\r\nsome time, was extremely uneasy, as Reissiger was away on his holiday,\r\nat leaving musical affairs in such a dangerous state of unrest. The\r\ndeceit and impudence of which I had been the victim was a revelation to\r\nme, and I gathered from this experience the calm sense necessary to set\r\nthe harassed director at ease by the most conclusive assurances that I\r\nunderstood the people with whom I had to deal, and would act\r\naccordingly. I faithfully kept my word, and never again came into\r\ncollision either with Lipinsky or any other member of the orchestra. On\r\nthe contrary, all the musicians were soon so firmly attached to me that\r\nI could always pride myself on their devotion.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward, however, one thing at least was certain, namely,\r\nthat I should not die as conductor at Dresden. My post and my work at\r\nDresden thenceforward became a burden, of which the occasionally\r\nexcellent results of my efforts made me all the more sensible.\r\n\r\nMy position at Dresden, however, brought me one friend whose intimate\r\nrelations with me long survived our artistic collaboration in Dresden.\r\nA musical director was assigned to each conductor; he had to be a\r\nmusician of repute, a hard worker, adaptable, and, above all, a\r\nCatholic, for the two conductors were Protestants, a cause of much\r\nannoyance to the clergy of the Catholic cathedral, numerous positions\r\nin which had to be filled from the orchestra. August Röckel, a nephew\r\nof Hummel, who sent in his application for this position from Weimar,\r\nfurnished evidence of his suitability under all these heads. He\r\nbelonged to an old Bavarian family; his father was a singer, and had\r\nsung the part of Florestan at the time of the first production of\r\nBeethoven’s Fidelio, and had himself remained on terms on close\r\nintimacy with the Master, many details about whose life have been\r\npreserved through his care. His subsequent position as a teacher of\r\nsinging led him to take up theatrical management, and he introduced\r\nGerman opera to the Parisians with so much success, that the credit for\r\nthe popularity of Fidelio and Der Freischutz with French audiences, to\r\nwhom these works were quite unknown, must be awarded to his admirable\r\nenterprise, which was also responsible for Schroder-Devrient’s debut in\r\nParis. August Röckel, his son, who was still a young man, by helping\r\nhis father in these and similar undertakings, had gained practical\r\nexperience as a musician. As his father’s business had for some time\r\neven extended to England, August had won practical knowledge of all\r\nsorts by contact with many men and things, and in addition had learned\r\nFrench and English. But music had remained his chosen vocation, and his\r\ngreat natural talent justified the highest hopes of success. He was an\r\nexcellent pianist, read scores with the utmost ease, possessed an\r\nexceptionally fine ear, and had indeed every qualification for a\r\npractical musician. As a composer he was actuated, not so much by a\r\nstrong impulse to create, as the desire to show what he was capable of;\r\nthe success at which he aimed was to gain the reputation of a clever\r\noperatic composer rather than recognition as a distinguished musician,\r\nand he hoped to obtain his end by the production of popular works.\r\nActuated by this modest ambition he had completed an opera, Farinelli,\r\nfor which he had also written the libretto, with no other aspiration\r\nthan that of attaining the same reputation as his brother-in-law\r\nLortzing.\r\n\r\nHe brought this score to me, and begged me—it was his first visit\r\nbefore he had heard one of my operas in Dresden—to play him something\r\nfrom Rienzi and the Fliegender Holländer. His frank, agreeable\r\npersonality induced me to try and meet his wishes as far as I could;\r\nand I am convinced that I soon made such a great and unexpectedly\r\npowerful impression on him that from that moment he determined not to\r\nbother me further with the score of his opera. It was not until we had\r\nbecome more intimate and had discovered mutual personal interests, that\r\nthe desire of turning his work to account induced him to ask me to show\r\nmy practical friendship by turning my attention to his score. I made\r\nvarious suggestions as to how it might be improved, but he was soon so\r\nhopelessly disgusted with his own work that he put it absolutely aside,\r\nand never again felt seriously moved to undertake a similar task. On\r\nmaking a closer acquaintance with my completed operas and plans for new\r\nworks, he declared to me that he felt it his vocation to play the part\r\nof spectator, to be my faithful helper and the interpreter of my new\r\nideas, and, as far as in him lay, to remove entirely, and at all events\r\nto relieve me as far as possible from, all the unpleasantnesses of my\r\nofficial position and of my dealings with the outside world. He wished,\r\nhe said, to avoid placing himself in the ridiculous position of\r\ncomposing operas of his own while living on terms of close friendship\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I tried to urge him to turn his own talent to account,\r\nand to this end called his attention to several plots which I wished\r\nhim to work out. Among these was the idea contained in a small French\r\ndrama entitled Cromwell’s Daughter, which was subsequently used as the\r\nsubject for a sentimental pastoral romance, and for the elaboration of\r\nwhich I presented him with an exhaustive plan.\r\n\r\nBut in the end all my efforts remained fruitless, and it became evident\r\nthat his productive talent was feeble. This perhaps arose partly from\r\nhis extremely needy and trying domestic circumstances, which were such\r\nthat the poor fellow wore himself out to support his wife and numerous\r\ngrowing children. Indeed, he claimed my help and sympathy in quite\r\nanother fashion than by arousing my interest in his artistic\r\ndevelopment. He was unusually clear-headed, and possessed a rare\r\ncapacity for teaching and educating himself in every branch of\r\nknowledge and experience; he was, moreover, so genuinely true and\r\ngood-hearted that he soon became my intimate friend and comrade. He\r\nwas, and continued to be, the only person who really appreciated the\r\nsingular nature of my position towards the surrounding world, and with\r\nwhom I could fully and sincerely discuss the cares and sorrows arising\r\ntherefrom. What dreadful trials and experiences, what painful anxieties\r\nour common fate was to bring upon us, will soon be seen.\r\n\r\nThe earlier period of my establishment in Dresden brought me also\r\nanother devoted and lifelong friend, though his qualities were such\r\nthat he exerted a less decisive influence upon my career. This was a\r\nyoung physician, named Anton Pusinelli, who lived near me. He seized\r\nthe occasion of a serenade sung in honour of my thirtieth birthday by\r\nthe Dresden Glee Club to express to me personally his hearty and\r\nsincere attachment. We soon entered upon a quiet friendship from which\r\nwe derived a mutual benefit. He became my attentive family doctor, and\r\nduring my residence in Dresden, marked as it was by accumulating\r\ndifficulties, he had abundant opportunities of helping me. His\r\nfinancial position was very good, and his ready self-sacrifice enabled\r\nhim to give me substantial succour and bound me to him by many\r\nheartfelt obligations.\r\n\r\nA further development of my association with Dresden buddy was provided\r\nby the kindly advances of Chamberlain von Konneritz’s family. His wife,\r\nMarie von Konneritz (nee Fink), was a friend of Countess Ida Hahn-Hahn,\r\nand expressed her appreciation of my success as a composer with great\r\nwarmth, I might almost say, with enthusiasm. I was often invited to\r\ntheir house, and seemed likely, through this family, to be brought into\r\ntouch with the higher aristocracy of Dresden. I merely succeeded in\r\ntouching the fringe, however, as we really had nothing in common. True,\r\nI here made the acquaintance of Countess Rossi, the famous Sontag, by\r\nwhom, to my genuine astonishment, I was most heartily greeted, and I\r\nthereby obtained the right of afterwards approaching her in Berlin with\r\na certain degree of familiarity. The curious way in which I was\r\ndisillusioned about this lady on that occasion will be related in due\r\ncourse. I would only mention here that, through my earlier experiences\r\nof the world, I had become fairly impervious to deception, and my\r\ndesire for closer acquaintance with these circles speedily gave way to\r\na complete hopelessness and an entire lack of ease in their sphere of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Konneritz couple remained friendly during the whole of my\r\nprolonged sojourn in Dresden, yet the connection had not the least\r\ninfluence either upon my development or my position. Only once, on the\r\noccasion of a quarrel between Lüttichau and myself, the former observed\r\nthat Frau von Konneritz, by her unmeasured praises, had turned my head\r\nand made me forget my position towards him. But in making this taunt he\r\nforgot that, if any woman in the higher ranks of Dresden society had\r\nexerted a real and invigorating influence upon my inward pride, that\r\nwoman was his own wife, Ida von Lüttichau (nee von Knobelsdorf).\r\n\r\nThe power which this cultured, gentle, and distinguished lady exercised\r\nover my life was of a kind I now experienced for the first time, and\r\nmight have become of great importance had I been favoured with more\r\nfrequent and intimate intercourse. But it was less her position as wife\r\nof the general director than her constant ill-health and my own\r\npeculiar unwillingness to appear obtrusive, that hindered our meeting,\r\nexcept at rare intervals. My recollections of her merge somewhat, in my\r\nmemory, with those of my own sister Rosalie. I remember the tender\r\nambition which inspired me to win the encouraging sympathy of this\r\nsensitive woman, who was painfully wasting away amid the coarsest\r\nsurroundings. My earliest hope for the fulfilment of this ambition\r\narose from her appreciation of my Fliegender Holländer, in spite of the\r\nfact that, following close upon Rienzi, it had so puzzled the Dresden\r\npublic. In this way she was the first, so to speak, who swam against\r\nthe tide and met me upon my new path. So deeply was I touched by this\r\nconquest that, when I afterwards published the opera, I dedicated it to\r\nher. In the account of my later years in Dresden I shall have more to\r\nrecord of the warm sympathy for my new development and dearest artistic\r\naims for which I was indebted to her. But of real intercourse we had\r\nnone, and the character of my Dresden life was not affected by this\r\nacquaintance, otherwise so important in itself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my theatrical acquaintances thrust themselves with\r\nirresistible importunancy into the wide foreground of my life, and in\r\nfact, after my brilliant successes, I was still restricted to the same\r\nlimited and familiar sphere in which I had prepared myself for these\r\ntriumphs. Indeed, the only one who joined my old friends Heine and\r\nGaffer Fischer was Tichatschek, with his strange domestic circle. Any\r\none who lived in Dresden at that time and chanced to know the court\r\nlithographer, Furstenau, will be astonished to hear that, without\r\nreally being aware of it myself, I entered into a familiarity that was\r\nto prove a lasting one with this man who was an intimate friend of\r\nTichatschek’s. The importance of this singular connection may be judged\r\nfrom the fact that my complete withdrawal from him coincided exactly\r\nwith the collapse of my civic position in Dresden.\r\n\r\nMy good-humoured acceptance of election to the musical committee of the\r\nDresden Glee Club also brought me further chance acquaintances. This\r\nclub consisted of a limited number of young merchants and officials,\r\nwho had more taste for any kind of convivial entertainment than for\r\nmusic. But it was seduously kept together by a remarkable and ambitious\r\nman, Professor Lowe, who nursed it with special objects in view, for\r\nthe attainment of which he felt the need of an authority such as I\r\npossessed at that time in Dresden.\r\n\r\nAmong other aims he was particularly and chiefly concerned in arranging\r\nfor the transfer of Weber’s remains from London to Dresden. As this\r\nproject was one which interested me also, I lent him my support, though\r\nhe was in reality merely following the voice of personal ambition. He\r\nfurthermore desired, as head of the Glee Club—which, by the way, from\r\nthe point of view of music was quite worthless—to invite all the male\r\nchoral unions of Saxony to a great gala performance in Dresden. A\r\ncommittee was appointed for the execution of this plan, and as things\r\nsoon became pretty warm, Lowe turned it into a regular revolutionary\r\ntribunal, over which, as the great day of triumph approached, he\r\npresided day and night without resting, and by his furious zeal earned\r\nfrom me the nickname of ‘Robespierre.’\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that I had been placed at the head of this\r\nenterprise, I luckily managed to evade his terrorism, as I was fully\r\noccupied with a great composition promised for the festival. The task\r\nhad been assigned to me of writing an important piece for male voices\r\nonly, which, if possible, should occupy half an hour. I reflected that\r\nthe tiresome monotony of male singing, which even the orchestra could\r\nonly enliven to a slight extent, can only be endured by the\r\nintroduction of dramatic themes. I therefore designed a great choral\r\nscene, selecting the apostolic Pentecost with the outpouring of the\r\nHoly Ghost as its subject. I completely avoided any real solos, but\r\nworked out the whole in such a way that it should be executed by\r\ndetached choral masses according to requirement. Out of this\r\ncomposition arose my Liebesmahl der Apostel (‘Lovefeast of the\r\nApostles’), which has recently been performed in various places.\r\n\r\nAs I was obliged at all costs to finish it within a limited time, I do\r\nnot mind including this in the list of my uninspired compositions. But\r\nI was not displeased with it when it was done, more especially when it\r\nwas played at the rehearsals given by the Dresden choral societies\r\nunder my personal supervision. When, therefore, twelve hundred singers\r\nfrom all parts of Saxony gathered around me in the Frauenkirche, where\r\nthe performance took place, I was astonished at the comparatively\r\nfeeble effect produced upon my ear by this colossal human tangle of\r\nsounds. The conclusion at which I arrived was, that these enormous\r\nchoral undertakings are folly, and I never again felt inclined to\r\nrepeat the experiment.\r\n\r\nIt was with much difficulty that I shook myself free of the Dresden\r\nGlee Club, and I only succeeded in doing so by introducing to Professor\r\nLowe another ambitious man in the person of Herr Ferdinand Hiller. My\r\nmost glorious exploit in connection with this association was the\r\ntransfer of Weber’s ashes, of which I will speak later on, though it\r\noccurred at an earlier date. I will only refer now to another\r\ncommissioned composition which, as royal bandmaster, I was officially\r\ncommanded to produce. On the 7th of June of this year (1843) the statue\r\nof King Frederick Augustus by Rietschl was unveiled in the Dresden\r\nZwinger [12] with all due pomp and ceremony. In honour of this event I,\r\nin collaboration with Mendelssohn, was commanded to compose a festal\r\nsong, and to conduct the gala performance. I had written a simple song\r\nfor male voices of modest design, whereas to Mendelssohn had been\r\nassigned the more complicated task of interweaving the National Anthem\r\n(the English ‘God Save the King,’ which in Saxony is called Heil Dir im\r\nRautenkranz) into the male chorus he had to compose. This he had\r\neffected by an artistic work in counterpoint, so arranged that from the\r\nfirst eight beats of his original melody the brass instruments\r\nsimultaneously played the Anglo-Saxon popular air. My simpler song\r\nseems to have sounded very well from a distance, whereas I understood\r\nthat Mendelssohn’s daring combination quite missed its effect, because\r\nno one could understand why the vocalists did not sing the same air as\r\nthe wind instruments were playing. Nevertheless Mendelssohn, who was\r\npresent, left me a written expression of thanks for the pains I had\r\ntaken in the production of his composition. I also received a gold\r\nsnuff-box from the grand gala committee, presumably meant as a reward\r\nfor my male chorus, but the hunting scene which was engraved on the top\r\nwas so badly done that I found, to my surprise, that in several places\r\nthe metal was cut through.\r\n\r\n [12] This is the name by which the famous Dresden Art Galleries are\r\n known.—Editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmid all the distractions of this new and very different mode of life,\r\nI diligently strove to concentrate and steel my soul against these\r\ninfluences, bearing in mind my experiences of success in the past. By\r\nMay of my thirtieth year I had finished my poem Der Venusberg (‘The\r\nMount of Venus’), as I called Tannhäuser at that time. I had not yet by\r\nany means gained any real knowledge of mediaeval poetry. The classical\r\nside of the poetry of the Middle Ages had so far only faintly dawned\r\nupon me, partly from my youthful recollections, and partly from the\r\nbrief acquaintance I had made with it through Lehrs’ instruction in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nNow that I was secure in the possession of a royal appointment that\r\nwould last my lifetime, the establishment of a permanent domestic\r\nhearth began to assume great importance; for I hoped it would enable me\r\nto take up my serious studies once more, and in such a way as to make\r\nthem productive—an aim which my theatrical life and the miseries of my\r\nyears in Paris had rendered impossible. My hope of being able to do\r\nthis was strengthened by the character of my official employment, which\r\nwas never very arduous, and in which I met with exceptional\r\nconsideration from the general management. Though I had only held my\r\nappointment for a few months, yet I was given a holiday this first\r\nsummer, which I spent in a second visit to Toplitz, a place which I had\r\ngrown to like, and whither I had sent on my wife in advance.\r\n\r\nKeenly indeed did I appreciate the change in my position since the\r\npreceding year. I could now engage four spacious and well-appointed\r\nrooms in the same house—the Eiche at Schonau—where I had before lived\r\nin such straitened and frugal circumstances. I invited my sister Clara\r\nto pay us a visit, and also my good mother, whose gout necessitated her\r\ntaking the Toplitz baths every year. I also seized the opportunity of\r\ndrinking the mineral waters, which I hoped might have a beneficial\r\neffect on the gastric troubles from which I had suffered ever since my\r\nvicissitudes in Paris. Unfortunately the attempted cure had a contrary\r\neffect, and when I complained of the painful irritation produced, I\r\nlearned that my constitution was not adapted for water cures. In fact,\r\non my morning promenade, and while drinking my water, I had been\r\nobserved to race through the shady alleys of the adjacent Thurn\r\nGardens, and it was pointed out to me that such a cure could only be\r\nproperly wrought by leisurely calm and easy sauntering. It was also\r\nremarked that I usually carried about a fairly stout volume, and that,\r\narmed with this and my bottle of mineral water, I used to take rest in\r\nlonely places.\r\n\r\nThis book was J. Grimm’s German Mythology. All who know the work can\r\nunderstand how the unusual wealth of its contents, gathered from every\r\nside, and meant almost exclusively for the student, would react upon\r\nme, whose mind was everywhere seeking for something definite and\r\ndistinct. Formed from the scanty fragments of a perished world, of\r\nwhich scarcely any monuments remained recognisable and intact, I here\r\nfound a heterogeneous building, which at first glance seemed but a\r\nrugged rock clothed in straggling brambles. Nothing was finished, only\r\nhere and there could the slightest resemblance to an architectonic line\r\nbe traced, so that I often felt tempted to relinquish the thankless\r\ntask of trying to build from such materials. And yet I was enchained by\r\na wondrous magic. The baldest legend spoke to me of its ancient home,\r\nand soon my whole imagination thrilled with images; long-lost forms for\r\nwhich I had sought so eagerly shaped themselves ever more and more\r\nclearly into realities that lived again. There rose up soon before my\r\nmind a whole world of figures, which revealed themselves as so\r\nstrangely plastic and primitive, that, when I saw them clearly before\r\nme and heard their voices in my heart, I could not account for the\r\nalmost tangible familiarity and assurance of their demeanour. The\r\neffect they produced upon the inner state of my soul I can only\r\ndescribe as an entire rebirth. Just as we feel a tender joy over a\r\nchild’s first bright smile of recognition, so now my own eyes flashed\r\nwith rapture as I saw a world, revealed, as it were, by miracle, in\r\nwhich I had hitherto moved blindly as the babe in its mother’s womb.\r\n\r\nBut the result of this reading did not at first do much to help me in\r\nmy purpose of composing part of the Tannhäuser music. I had had a piano\r\nput in my room at the Eiche, and though I smashed all its strings,\r\nnothing satisfactory would emerge. With much pain and toil I sketched\r\nthe first outlines of my music for the Venusberg, as fortunately I\r\nalready had its theme in my mind. Meanwhile I was very much troubled by\r\nexcitability and rushes of blood to the brain. I imagined I was ill,\r\nand lay for whole days in bed, where I read Grimm’s German legends, or\r\ntried to master the disagreeable mythology. It was quite a relief when\r\nI hit upon the happy thought of freeing myself from the torments of my\r\ncondition by an excursion to Prague. Meanwhile I had already ascended\r\nMount Millischau once with my wife, and in her company I now made the\r\njourney to Prague in an open carriage. There I stayed once more at my\r\nfavourite inn, the Black Horse, met my friend Kittl, who had now grown\r\nfat and rotund, made various excursions, revelled in the curious\r\nantiquities of the old city, and learned to my joy that the two lovely\r\nfriends of my youth, Jenny and Auguste Pachta, had been happily married\r\nto members of the highest aristocracy. Thereupon, having reassured\r\nmyself that everything was in the best possible order, I returned to\r\nDresden and resumed my functions as musical conductor to the King of\r\nSaxony.\r\n\r\nWe now set to work on the preparations and furnishing of a roomy and\r\nwell-situated house in the Ostra Allee, with an outlook upon the\r\nZwinger. Everything was good and substantial, as is only right for a\r\nman of thirty who is settling down at last for the whole of his life.\r\nAs I had not received any subsidy towards this outlay, I had naturally\r\nto raise the money by loan. But I could look forward to a certain\r\nharvest from my operatic successes in Dresden, and what was more\r\nnatural than for me to expect soon to earn more than enough? The three\r\nmost valued treasures which adorned my house were a concert grand piano\r\nby Breitkopf and Hartel, which I had bought with much pride; a stately\r\nwriting-desk, now in possession of Otto Kummer, the chamber-music\r\nartist; and the title-page by Cornelius for the Nibelungen, in a\r\nhandsome Gothic frame—the only object which has remained faithful to me\r\nto the present day. But the thing which above all else made my house\r\nseem homelike and attractive was the presence of a library, which I\r\nprocured in accordance with a systematic plan laid down by my proposed\r\nline of study. On the failure of my Dresden career this library passed\r\nin a curious way into the possession of Herr Heinrich Brockhaus, to\r\nwhom at that time I owed fifteen hundred marks, and who took it as\r\nsecurity for the amount. My wife knew nothing at the time of this\r\nobligation, and I never afterwards succeeded in recovering this\r\ncharacteristic collection from his hands. Upon its shelves old German\r\nliterature was especially well represented, and also the closely\r\nrelated work of the German Middle Ages, including many a costly volume,\r\nas, for instance, the rare old work, Romans des douze Paris. Beside\r\nthese stood many excellent historical works on the Middle Ages, as well\r\nas on the German people in general. At the same time I made provision\r\nfor the poetical and classical literature of all times and languages.\r\nAmong these were the Italian poets, Shakespeare and the French writers,\r\nof whose language I had a passable knowledge. All these I acquired in\r\nthe original, hoping some day to find time to master their neglected\r\ntongues. As for the Greek and Roman classics, I had to content myself\r\nwith standard German translations. Indeed, on looking once more into my\r\nHomer—whom I secured in the original Greek—I soon recognised that I\r\nshould be presuming on more leisure than my conductorship was likely to\r\nleave me, if I hoped to find time for regaining my lost knowledge of\r\nthat language. Moreover, I provided most thoroughly for a study of\r\nuniversal history, and to this end did not fail to equip myself with\r\nthe most voluminous works. Thus armed, I thought I could bid defiance\r\nto all the trials which I clearly foresaw would inevitably accompany my\r\ncalling and position. In hopes, therefore, of long and peaceable\r\nenjoyment of this hard-earned home, I entered into possession with the\r\nbest of spirits in October of this year (1843), and though my\r\nconductor’s quarters were by no means magnificent, they were stately\r\nand substantial.\r\n\r\nThe first leisure in my new home which I could snatch from the claims\r\nof my profession and my favourite studies was devoted to the\r\ncomposition of Tannhäuser, the first act of which was completed in\r\nJanuary of the new year, 1844. I have no recollections of any\r\nimportance regarding my activities in Dresden during this winter. The\r\nonly memorable events were two enterprises which took me away from\r\nhome, the first to Berlin early in the year, for the production of my\r\nFliegender Holländer, and the other in March to Hamburg for Rienzi.\r\n\r\nOf these the former made the greater impression upon my mind. The\r\nmanager of the Berlin theatre, Küstner, quite took me by surprise when\r\nhe announced the first performance of the Fliegender Holländer for an\r\nearly date.\r\n\r\nAs the opera house had been burnt down only about a year before, and\r\ncould not possibly have been rebuilt, it had not occurred to me to\r\nremind them about the production of my opera. It had been performed in\r\nDresden with very poor scenic accessories, and knowing how important a\r\ncareful and artistic execution of the difficult scenery was for my\r\ndramatic sea-scapes, I had relied implicitly on the admirable\r\nmanagement and staging capacities of the Berlin opera house.\r\nConsequently I was very much annoyed that the Berlin manager should\r\nselect my opera as a stopgap to be produced at the Comedy Theatre,\r\nwhich was being used as a temporary opera house. All remonstrances\r\nproved useless, for I learned that they were not merely thinking about\r\nrehearsing the work, but that it was already actually being rehearsed,\r\nand would be produced in a few days. It was obvious that this\r\narrangement meant that my opera was to be condemned to quite a short\r\nrun in their repertoire, as it was not to be expected that they would\r\nremount it when the new opera house was opened. On the other hand, they\r\ntried to appease me by saying that this first production of the\r\nFliegender Holländer was to be associated with a special engagement of\r\nSchroder-Devrient, which was to begin in Berlin immediately. They\r\nnaturally thought I should be delighted to see the great actress in my\r\nown work. But this only confirmed me in the suspicion that this opera\r\nwas simply wanted as a makeshift for the duration of\r\nSchroder-Devrient’s visit. They were evidently in a dilemma with regard\r\nto her repertoire, which consisted mainly of so-called grand\r\noperas—such as Meyerbeer’s—destined exclusively for the opera house,\r\nand which were being specially reserved for the brilliant future of the\r\nnew building. I therefore realised beforehand that my Fliegender\r\nHolländer was to be relegated to the category of conductor’s operas,\r\nand would meet with the usual predestined fate of such productions. The\r\nwhole treatment meted out to me and my works all pointed in the same\r\ndirection; but in consideration of the expected co-operation of\r\nSchroder-Devrient I fought against these vexatious premonitions, and\r\nset out for Berlin to do all I could for the success of my opera. I saw\r\nat once that my presence was very necessary. I found the conductor’s\r\ndesk occupied by a man calling himself Conductor Henning (or Henniger),\r\nan official who had won promotion from the ranks of ordinary musicians\r\nby an upright observance of the laws of seniority, but who knew\r\nprecious little about conducting an orchestra at all, and about my\r\nopera had not the faintest glimmer of an idea. I took my seat at the\r\ndesk, and conducted one full rehearsal and two performances, in neither\r\nof which, however, did Schroder-Devrient take part. Although I found\r\nmuch to complain of in the weakness of the string instruments and the\r\nconsequent mean sound of the orchestra, yet I was well satisfied with\r\nthe actors both as regards their capacity and their zeal. The careful\r\nstaging, moreover, which under the supervision of the really gifted\r\nstage manager, Blum, and with the co-operation of his skilful and\r\ningenious mechanics, was truly excellent, gave me a most pleasant\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nI was now very curious to learn what effect these pleasing and\r\nencouraging preparations would have upon the Berlin public when the\r\nfull performance took place. My experiences on this point were very\r\ncurious. Apparently the only thing that interested the large audience\r\nwas to discover my weak points. During the first act the prevalent\r\nopinion seemed to be that I belonged to the category of bores. Not a\r\nsingle hand was moved, and I was afterwards informed that this was\r\nfortunate, as the slightest attempt at applause would have been\r\nascribed to a paid claque, and would have been energetically opposed.\r\nKüstner alone assured me that the composure with which, on the close of\r\nthis act, I quitted my desk and appeared before the curtain, had filled\r\nhim with wonder, considering this entire absence—lucky as it appears to\r\nhave been—of all applause. But so long as I myself felt content with\r\nthe execution, I was not disposed to let the public apathy discourage\r\nme, knowing, as I did, that the crucial test was in the second act.\r\n\r\nIt lay, therefore, much nearer my heart to do all I could for the\r\nsuccess of this than to inquire into the reasons for this attitude on\r\nthe part of the Berlin public. And here the ice was really broken at\r\nlast. The audience seemed to abandon all idea of finding a proper niche\r\nfor me, and allowed itself to be carried away into giving vent to\r\napplause, which at last grew into the most boisterous enthusiasm. At\r\nthe close of the act, amid a storm of shouts, I led forward my singers\r\non to the stage for the customary bows of thanks. As the third act was\r\ntoo short to be tedious, and as the scenic effects were both new and\r\nimpressive, we could not help hoping that we had won a veritable\r\ntriumph, especially as renewed outbursts of applause marked the end of\r\nthe performance. Mendelssohn, who happened at that time to be in\r\nBerlin, with Meyerbeer, on business relating to the general musical\r\nconductorship, was present in a stage box during this performance. He\r\nfollowed its progress with a pale face, and afterwards came and\r\nmurmured to me in a weary tone of voice, ‘Well, I should think you are\r\nsatisfied now!’ I met him several times during my brief stay in\r\nBerlin., and also spent an evening with him listening to various pieces\r\nof chamber-music. But never did another word concerning the Fliegender\r\nHolländer pass his lips, beyond inquiries as to the second performance,\r\nand as to whether Devrient or some one else would appear in it. I\r\nheard, moreover, that he had responded with equal indifference to the\r\nearnest warmth of my allusions to his own music for the Midsummer\r\nNight’s Dream, which was being frequently played at that time, and\r\nwhich I had heard for the first time. The only thing he discussed with\r\nany detail was the actor Gern, who was playing in Zettel, and who he\r\nconsidered was overacting his part.\r\n\r\nA few days later came a second performance with the same cast. My\r\nexperiences on this evening were even more startling than on the\r\nformer. Evidently the first night had won me a few friends, who were\r\nagain present, for they began to applaud after the overture. But others\r\nresponded with hisses, and for the rest of the evening no one again\r\nventured to applaud. My old friend Heine had arrived in the meantime\r\nfrom Dresden, sent by our own board of directors to study the scenic\r\narrangements of the Midsummer Night’s Dream for our theatre. He was\r\npresent at this second performance, and had persuaded me to accept the\r\ninvitation from one of his Berlin relatives to have supper after the\r\nperformance in a wine-bar unter den Linden. Very weary, I followed him\r\nto a nasty and badly lighted house, where I gulped down the wine with\r\nhasty ill-humour to warm myself, and listened to the embarrassed\r\nconversation of my good-natured friend and his companion, whilst I\r\nturned over the day’s papers. I now had ample leisure to read the\r\ncriticisms they contained on the first performance of my Fliegender\r\nHolländer. A terrible spasm cut my heart as I realised the contemptible\r\ntone and unparalleled shamelessness of their raging ignorance regarding\r\nmy own name and work. Our Berlin friend and host, a thorough\r\nPhilistine, said that he had known how things would go in the theatre\r\nthat night, after having read these criticisms in the morning. The\r\npeople of Berlin, he added, wait to hear what Rellstab and his mates\r\nhave to say, and then they know how to behave. The good fellow was\r\nanxious to cheer me up, and ordered one wine after another. Heine\r\nhunted up his reminiscences of our merry Rienzi times in Dresden, until\r\nat last the pair conducted me, staggering along in an addled condition,\r\nto my hotel.\r\n\r\nIt was already midnight. As I was being lighted by the waiter through\r\nits gloomy corridors to my room, a gentleman in black, with a pale\r\nrefined face, came forward and said he would like to speak to me. He\r\ninformed me that he had waited there since the close of the play, and\r\nas he was determined to see me, had stopped till now. I excused myself\r\non the ground of being quite unfit for business, and added that,\r\nalthough not exactly inclined to merriment, I had, as he might\r\nperceive, somewhat foolishly drunk a little too much wine. This I said\r\nin a stammering voice; but my strange visitor seemed only the more\r\nunwilling to be repulsed. He accompanied me to my room, declaring that\r\nit was all the more imperative for him to speak with me. We seated\r\nourselves in the cold room, by the meagre light of a single candle, and\r\nthen he began to talk. In flowing and impressive language he related\r\nthat he had been present at the performance that night of my Fliegender\r\nHolländer, and could well conceive the humour in which the evening’s\r\nexperiences had left me. For this very reason he felt that nothing\r\nshould hinder him from speaking to me that night, and telling me that\r\nin the Fliegender Holländer I had produced an unrivalled masterpiece.\r\nMoreover, the acquaintance he had made with this work had awakened in\r\nhim a new and unforeseen hope for the future of German art; and that it\r\nwould be a great pity if I yielded to any sense of discouragement as\r\nthe result of the unworthy reception accorded to it by the Berlin\r\npublic. My hair began to stand on end. One of Hoffmann’s fantastic\r\ncreations had entered bodily into my life. I could find nothing to say,\r\nexcept to inquire the name of my visitor, at which he seemed surprised,\r\nas I had talked with him the day before at Mendelssohn’s house. He said\r\nthat my conversation and manner had created such an impression upon him\r\nthere, and had filled him with such sudden regret at not having\r\nsufficiently overcome his dislike for opera in general, to be present\r\nat the first performance, that he had at once resolved not to miss the\r\nsecond. His name, he added, was Professor Werder. That was no use to\r\nme, I said, he must write his name down. Getting paper and ink, he did\r\nas I desired, and we parted. I flung myself unconsciously on the bed\r\nfor a deep and invigorating sleep. Next morning I was fresh and well. I\r\npaid a farewell call on Schroeder-Devrient, who promised me to do all\r\nshe could for the Fliegender Holländer as soon as possible, drew my fee\r\nof a hundred ducats, and set off for home. On my way through Leipzig I\r\nutilised my ducats for the repayment of sundry advances made me by my\r\nrelatives during the earlier and poverty-stricken period of my sojourn\r\nin Dresden, and then continued my journey, to recuperate among my books\r\nand meditate upon the deep impression made on me by Werder’s midnight\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of this winter I received a genuine invitation to\r\nHamburg for the performance of Rienzi. The enterprising director, Herr\r\nCornet, through whom it came, confessed that he had many difficulties\r\nto contend against in the management of his theatre, and was in need of\r\na great success. This, after the reception with which it had met in\r\nDresden, he thought he could secure by the production of Rienzi. I\r\naccordingly betook myself thither in the month of March. The journey at\r\nthat time was not an easy one, as after Hanover one had to proceed by\r\nmail-coach, and the crossing of the Elbe, which was full of floating\r\nice, was a risky business. Owing to a great fire that had recently\r\nbroken out, the town of Hamburg was in process of being rebuilt, and\r\nthere were still many wide spaces encumbered with ruins. Cold weather\r\nand an ever-gloomy sky make my recollections of my somewhat prolonged\r\nsojourn in this town anything but agreeable. I was tormented to such an\r\nextent by having to rehearse with bad material, fit only for the\r\npoorest theatrical trumpery, that, worn out and exposed to constant\r\ncolds, I spent most of my leisure time in the solitude of my inn\r\nchamber. My earlier experiences of ill-arranged and badly managed\r\ntheatres came back to me afresh. I was particularly depressed when I\r\nrealised that I had made myself an unconscious accomplice of Director\r\nCornet’s basest interests. His one aim was to create a sensation, which\r\nhe thought should be of great service to me also; and not only did he\r\nput me off with a smaller fee, but even suggested that it should be\r\npaid by gradual instalments. The dignity of scenic decoration, of which\r\nhe had not the smallest idea, was completely sacrificed to the most\r\nridiculous and tawdry showiness. He imagined that pageantry was all\r\nthat was really needed to secure my success. So he hunted out all the\r\nold fairy-ballet costumes from his stock, and fancied that if they only\r\nlooked gay enough, and if plenty of people were bustling about on the\r\nstage, I ought to be satisfied. But the most sorry item of all was the\r\nsinger he provided for the title-role. He was a man of the name of\r\nWurda, an elderly, flabby and voiceless tenor, who sang Rienzi with the\r\nexpression of a lover—like Elvino, for instance, in the Somnanibula. He\r\nwas so dreadful that I conceived the idea of making the Capitol tumble\r\ndown in the second act, so as to bury him sooner in its ruins, a plan\r\nwhich would have cut out several of the processions, which were so dear\r\nto the heart of the director. I found my one ray of light in a lady\r\nsinger, who delighted me with the fire with which she played the part\r\nof Adriano. This was a Mme. Fehringer, who was afterwards engaged by\r\nLiszt for the role of Ortrud in the production of Lohengrin at Weimar,\r\nbut by that time her powers had greatly deteriorated. Nothing could be\r\nmore depressing than my connection with this opera under such dismal\r\ncircumstances. And yet there were no outward signs of failure. The\r\nmanager hoped in any case to keep Rienzi in his repertoire until\r\nTichatschek was able to come to Hamburg and give the people of that\r\ntown a true idea of the play. This actually took place in the following\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nMy discouragement and ill-humour did not escape the notice of Herr\r\nCornet, and discovering that I wished to present my wife with a parrot,\r\nhe managed to procure a very fine bird, which he gave me as a parting\r\ngift. I carried it with me in its narrow cage on my melancholy journey\r\nhome, and was touched to find that it quickly repaid my care and became\r\nvery much attached to me. Minna greeted me with great joy when she saw\r\nthis beautiful grey parrot, for she regarded it as a self-evident proof\r\nthat I should do something in life. We already had a pretty little dog,\r\nborn on the day of the first Rienzi rehearsal in Dresden, which, owing\r\nto its passionate devotion to myself, was much petted by all who knew\r\nme and visited my house during those years. This sociable bird, which\r\nhad no vices and was an apt scholar, now formed an addition to our\r\nhousehold; and the pair did much to brighten our dwelling in the\r\nabsence of children. My wife soon taught the bird snatches of songs\r\nfrom Rienzi, with which it would good-naturedly greet me from a\r\ndistance when it heard me coming up the stairs.\r\n\r\nAnd thus at last my domestic hearth seemed to be established with every\r\npossible prospect of a comfortable competency.\r\n\r\nNo further excursions for the performance of any of my operas took\r\nplace, for the simple reason that no such performances were given. As I\r\nsaw it was quite clear that the diffusion of my works through the\r\ntheatrical world would be a very slow business, I concluded that this\r\nwas probably due to the fact that no adaptations of them for the piano\r\nexisted. I therefore thought that I should do well to press forward\r\nsuch an issue at all costs, and in order to secure the expected\r\nprofits, I hit upon the idea of publishing at my own expense. I\r\naccordingly made arrangements with F. Meser, the court music-dealer,\r\nwho had hitherto not got beyond the publication of a valse, and signed\r\nan agreement with him for his firm to appear as the nominal publishers\r\non the understanding that they should receive a commission of ten per\r\ncent, whilst I provided the necessary capital.\r\n\r\nAs there were two operas to be issued, including Rienzi, a work of\r\nexceptional bulk, it was not likely that these publications would prove\r\nvery profitable unless, in addition to the usual piano selections, I\r\nalso published adaptations, such as the music without words, for duet\r\nor solo. For this a fairly large capital was necessary. I also needed\r\nfunds for the repayment of the loans already mentioned, and for the\r\nsettlement of old debts, as well as to pay off the remaining expenses\r\nof my house-furnishing. I was therefore obliged to try and procure much\r\nlarger sums. I laid my project and its motive before Schroder-Devrient,\r\nwho had just returned to Dresden, at Easter, 1844, to fulfil a fresh\r\nengagement. She believed in the future of my works, recognised the\r\npeculiarity of my position, as well as the correctness of my\r\ncalculations, and declared her willingness to provide the necessary\r\ncapital for the publication of my operas, refusing to consider the act\r\nas one involving any sacrifice on her part. This money she proposed to\r\nget by selling out her investments in Polish state-bonds, and I was to\r\npay the customary rate of interest. The thing was so easily done, and\r\nseemed so much a matter of course, that I at once made all needful\r\narrangements with my Leipzig printer, and set to work on the\r\npublication of my operas.\r\n\r\nWhen the amount of work delivered brought with it a demand for\r\nconsiderable payments on account, I approached my friend for a first\r\nadvance. And here I became confronted with a new phase of that famous\r\nlady’s life, which placed me in a position which proved as disastrous\r\nas it was unexpected. After having broken away from the unlucky Herr\r\nvon Munchhausen some time previously, and returned, as it appeared,\r\nwith penitential ardour to her former connection with my friend,\r\nHermann Muller, it now turned out that she had found no real\r\nsatisfaction in this fresh relationship. On the contrary, the star of\r\nher being, whom she had so long and ardently desired, had now at last\r\narisen in the person of another lieutenant of the Guards. With a\r\nvehemence which made light of her treachery to her old friend, she\r\nelected this slim young man, whose moral and intellectual weaknesses\r\nwere patent to every eye, as the chosen keystone of her life’s love. He\r\ntook the good luck that befell him so seriously, that he would brook no\r\njesting, and at once laid hands on the fortune of his future wife, as\r\nhe considered that it was disadvantageously and insecurely invested,\r\nand thought that he knew of much more profitable ways of employing it.\r\nMy friend therefore explained, with much pain and evident\r\nembarrassment, that she had renounced all control over her capital, and\r\nwas unable to keep her promise to me.\r\n\r\nOwing to this I entered upon a series of entanglements and troubles\r\nwhich henceforth dominated my life, and plunged me into sorrows that\r\nleft their dismal mark on all my subsequent enterprises. It was clear\r\nthat I could not now abandon the proposed plan of publication. The only\r\nsatisfactory solution of my perplexities was to be found in the\r\nexecution of my project and the success which I hoped would attend it.\r\nI was compelled, therefore, to turn all my energies to the raising of\r\nthe money wherewith to publish my two operas, to which in all\r\nprobability Tannhäuser would shortly have to be added. I first applied\r\nto my friends, and in some cases had to pay exorbitant rates of\r\ninterest, even for short terms. For the present these details are\r\nsufficient to prepare the reader for the catastrophe towards which I\r\nwas now inevitably drifting.\r\n\r\nThe hopelessness of my position did not at first reveal itself. There\r\nseemed no reason to despair of the eventual spread of my operatic works\r\namong the theatres in Germany, though my experience of them indicated\r\nthat the process would be slow. In spite of the depressing experiences\r\nin Berlin and Hamburg, there were many encouraging signs to be seen.\r\nAbove all, Rienzi maintained its position in favour of the people of\r\nDresden, a place which undoubtedly occupied a position of great\r\nimportance, especially during the summer months, when so many strangers\r\nfrom all parts of the world pass through it. My opera, which was not to\r\nbe heard anywhere else, was in great request, both among the Germans\r\nand other visitors, and was always received with marked approbation,\r\nwhich surprised me very much. Thus a performance of Rienzi, especially\r\nin summer, became quite a Dionysian revelry, whose effect upon me could\r\nnot fail to be encouraging.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Liszt was among the number of these visitors. As Rienzi\r\ndid not happen to be in the repertoire when he arrived, he induced the\r\nmanagement at his earnest request to arrange a special performance. I\r\nmet him between the acts in Tichatschek’s dressing-room, and was\r\nheartily encouraged and touched by his almost enthusiastic\r\nappreciation, expressed in his most emphatic manner. The kind of life\r\nto which Liszt was at that time condemned, and which bound him to a\r\nperpetual environment of distracting and exciting elements, debarred us\r\nfrom all more intimate and fruitful intercourse. Yet from this time\r\nonward I continued to receive constant testimonies of the profound and\r\nlasting impression I had made upon him, as well as of his sympathetic\r\nremembrance of me. From various parts of the world, wherever his\r\ntriumphal progress led him, people, chiefly of the upper classes, came\r\nto Dresden for the purpose of hearing Rienzi. They had been so\r\ninterested by Liszt’s reports of my work, and by his playing of various\r\nselections from it, that they all came expecting something of\r\nunparalleled importance.\r\n\r\nBesides these indications of Liszt’s enthusiastic and friendly\r\nsympathy, other deeply touching testimonies appeared from different\r\nquarters. The startling beginning made by Werder, on the occasion of\r\nhis midnight visit after the second performance of the Fliegender\r\nHolländer in Berlin, was shortly afterwards followed by a similarly\r\nunsolicited approach in the form of an effusive letter from an equally\r\nunknown personage, Alwino Frommann, who afterwards became my faithful\r\nfriend. After my departure from Berlin she heard Schroder-Devrient\r\ntwice in the Fliegender Holländer, and the letter in which she\r\ndescribed the effect produced upon her by my work conveyed to me for\r\nthe first time the vigorous and profound sentiments of a deep and\r\nconfident recognition such as seldom falls to the lot of even the\r\ngreatest master, and cannot fail to exercise a weighty influence on his\r\nmind and spirit, which long for self-confidence.\r\n\r\nI have no very vivid recollections of my own doings during this first\r\nyear of my position as conductor in a sphere of action which gradually\r\ngrew more and more familiar. For the anniversary of my appointment, and\r\nto some extent as a personal recognition, I was commissioned to procure\r\nGluck’s Armida. This we performed in March, 1843, with the co-operation\r\nof Schroder-Devrient, just before her temporary departure from Dresden.\r\nGreat importance was attached to this production, because, at the same\r\nmoment, Meyerbeer was inaugurating his general-directorship in Berlin\r\nby a performance of the same work. Indeed, it was in Berlin that the\r\nextraordinary respect entertained for such a commemoration of Gluck had\r\nits origin. I was told that Meyerbeer went to Rellstab with the score\r\nof Armida in order to obtain hints as to its correct interpretation.\r\n\r\nAs not long afterwards I also heard a strange story of two silver\r\ncandlesticks, wherewith the famous composer was said, to have\r\nenlightened the no less famous critic when showing him the score of his\r\nFeldlager in Schlesien, I decided to attach no great importance to the\r\ninstructions he might have received, but rather to help myself by a\r\ncareful handling of this difficult score, and by introducing some\r\nsoftness into it through modulating the variations in tone as much as\r\npossible. I had the gratification later of receiving an exceedingly\r\nwarm appreciation of my rendering from Herr Eduard Devrient, a great\r\nGluck connoisseur. After hearing this opera as presented by us, and\r\ncomparing it with the Berlin performance, he heartily praised the\r\ntenderly modulated character of our rendering of certain parts, which,\r\nhe said, had been given in Berlin with the coarsest bluntness. He\r\nmentioned, as a striking instance of this, a brief chorus in C major of\r\nmale and female nymphs in the third act. By the introduction of a more\r\nmoderate tempo and very soft piano I had tried to free this from the\r\noriginal coarseness with which Devrient had heard it rendered in\r\nBerlin—presumably with traditional fidelity. My most innocent device,\r\nand one which I frequently adopted, for disguising the irritating\r\nstiffness or the orchestral movement in the original, was a careful\r\nmodification of the Basso-continuo, which was taken uninterruptedly in\r\ncommon time. This I felt obliged to remedy, partly by legato playing,\r\nand partly by pizzicato.\r\n\r\nOur management were lavish in their expenditure on externals,\r\nespecially decoration, and as a spectacular opera the piece drew fairly\r\nlarge houses, thus earning me the reputation of being a very suitable\r\nconductor for Gluck, and one who was in close sympathy with him. This\r\nresult was the more conspicuous from the fact that Iphigenia in Tauris\r\nwhich is a far superior work, and in which Devrient’s interpretation of\r\nthe title-role was admirable had been performed to empty houses.\r\n\r\nI had to live upon this reputation for a long time, as it often\r\nhappened that I was compelled to give inferior performances of\r\nrepertoire pieces, including Mozart’s operas. The mediocrity of these\r\nwas particularly disappointing to those who, after my success in\r\nArmida, had expected a great deal from my rendering of these pieces,\r\nand were much disappointed in consequence. Even sympathetic hearers\r\nsought to explain their disappointment on the ground that I did not\r\nappreciate Mozart and could not understand him. But they failed to\r\nrealise how impossible it was for me, as a mere conductor, to exercise\r\nany real influence on such desultory performances, which were merely\r\ngiven as stopgaps, and often without rehearsal. Indeed, in this matter\r\nI often found myself in a false position, which, as I was powerless to\r\nremedy it, contributed not a little to render unbearable both my new\r\noffice and my dependence upon the meanest motives of a paltry\r\ntheatrical routine, already overweighted with the cares of business.\r\nThis, in fact, became worse than I had expected, in spite of my\r\nprevious knowledge of the precariousness of such a life. My colleague\r\nReissiger, to whom from time to time I poured out my woes regarding the\r\nscant attention given by the general management to our demands for the\r\nmaintenance of correct representations in the realm of opera, comforted\r\nme by saying that I, like himself, would sooner or later relinquish all\r\nthese fads and submit to the inevitable fate of a conductor. Thereupon\r\nhe proudly smote his stomach, and hoped that I might soon be able to\r\nboast of one as round as his own.\r\n\r\nI received further provocation for my growing dislike of these jog-trot\r\nmethods from a closer acquaintance with the spirit in which even\r\neminent conductors undertook the reproduction of our masterpieces.\r\nDuring this first year Mendelssohn was invited to conduct his St. Paul\r\nfor one of the Palm Sunday concerts in the Dresden chapel, which was\r\nfamous at that time. The knowledge I thus acquired of this work, under\r\nsuch favourable circumstances, pleased me so much, that I made a fresh\r\nattempt to approach the composer with sincere and friendly motives; but\r\na remarkable conversation which I had with him on the evening of this\r\nperformance quickly and strangely repelled my impulse. After the\r\noratorio Reissiger was to produce Beethoven’s Eighth Symphony. I had\r\nnoticed in the preceding rehearsal that Keissiger had fallen into the\r\nerror of all the ordinary conductors of this work by taking the tempo\r\ndi minuetto of the third movement at a meaningless waltz time, whereby\r\nnot only does the whole piece lose its imposing character, but the trio\r\nis rendered absolutely ridiculous by the impossibility of the\r\nvioloncello part being interpreted at such a speed. I had called\r\nReissiger’s attention to this defect, and he acquiesced in my opinion,\r\npromising to take the part in question at true minuetto tempo. I\r\nrelated this to Mendelssohn, when he was resting after his own\r\nperformance in the box beside me, listening to the symphony. He, too,\r\nacknowledged that I was right, and thought that it ought to be played\r\nas I said. And now the third movement began. Reissiger, who, it is\r\ntrue, did not possess the needful power suddenly to impress so\r\nmomentous a change of time upon his orchestra with success, followed\r\nthe usual custom and took the tempo di minuetto in the same old waltz\r\ntime. Just as I was about to express my anger, Mendelssohn gave me a\r\nfriendly nod, as though he thought that this was what I wanted, and\r\nthat I had understood the music in this way. I was so amazed by this\r\ncomplete absence of feeling on the part of the famous musician, that I\r\nwas struck dumb, and thenceforth my own particular opinion of\r\nMendelssohn gradually matured, an opinion which was afterwards\r\nconfirmed by R. Schumann. The latter, in expressing the sincere\r\npleasure he had felt on listening to the time at which I had taken the\r\nfirst movement of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, told me that he had been\r\ncompelled to hear it year after year taken by Mendelssohn at a\r\nperfectly distracting speed.\r\n\r\nAmid my yearning anxiety to exert some influence upon the spirit in\r\nwhich our noblest masterpieces were executed, I had to struggle against\r\nthe profound dissatisfaction I felt with my employment on the ordinary\r\ntheatre repertoire. It was not until Palm Sunday of the year 1844, just\r\nafter my dispiriting expedition to Hamburg, that my desire to conduct\r\nthe Pastoral Symphony was satisfied. But many faults still remained\r\nunremedied, and for the removal of these I had to adopt indirect\r\nmethods which gave me much trouble. For instance, at these famous\r\nconcerts the arrangement of the orchestra, the members of which were\r\nseated in a long, thin, semicircular row round the chorus of singers,\r\nwas so inconceivably stupid that it required the explanation given by\r\nReissiger to make me understand such folly. He told me that all these\r\narrangements dated from the time of the late conductor Morlacchi, who,\r\nas an Italian composer of operas, had no true realisation of the\r\nimportance of the orchestra nor of its necessities. When, therefore, I\r\nasked why they had permitted him to meddle with things he did not\r\nunderstand, I learned that the preference shown to this Italian, both\r\nby the court and the general management, even in opposition to Carl\r\nMaria von Weber, had always been absolute and brooked no contradiction.\r\nI was warned that, even now, we should experience great difficulty in\r\nridding ourselves of these inherited vices, because the opinion still\r\nprevailed in the highest circles that he must have understood best what\r\nhe was about.\r\n\r\nOnce more my childish memories of the eunuch Sassaroli flashed through\r\nmy mind, and I remembered the warning of Weber’s widow as to the\r\nsignificance of my succession to her husband’s post of conductor in\r\nDresden. But, in spite of all this, our performance of the Pastoral\r\nSymphony succeeded beyond expectation, and the incomparable and\r\nwonderfully stimulating enjoyment, which I was in future to derive from\r\nmy intercourse with Beethoven’s works, now first enabled me to realise\r\nhis prolific strength. Kockel shared in this enjoyment with heartfelt\r\nsympathy; he supported me with eye and ear at every rehearsal, always\r\nstood by my side, and was at one with me both in his appreciation and\r\nhis aims.\r\n\r\nAfter this encouraging success I was to receive the gratification of\r\nanother triumph in the summer, which, although it was of no particular\r\nmoment from the musical point of view, was of great social importance.\r\nThe King of Saxony, towards whom, as I have already said, I had felt\r\nwarmly drawn when he was Prince Friedrich, was expected home from a\r\nlong visit to England. The reports received of his stay there had\r\ngreatly rejoiced my patriotic soul. While this homely monarch, who\r\nshrank from all pomp and noisy demonstration, was in England, it\r\nhappened that the Tsar Nicholas arrived quite unexpectedly on a visit\r\nto the Queen. In his honour great festivities and military reviews were\r\nheld, in which our King, much against his will, was obliged to\r\nparticipate, and he was consequently compelled to receive the\r\nenthusiastic acclamations of the English crowd, who were most\r\ndemonstrative in showing their preference for him, as compared with the\r\nunpopular Tsar. This preference was also reflected in the newspapers,\r\nso that a flattering incense floated over from England to our little\r\nSaxony which filled us all with a peculiar pride in our King. While I\r\nwas in this mood, which absorbed me completely, I learned that\r\npreparations were being made in Leipzig for a special welcome to the\r\nKing on his return, which was to be further dignified by a musical\r\nfestival in the directing of which Mendelssohn was to take part. I made\r\ninquiries as to what was going to be done in Dresden, and learned that\r\nthe King did not propose to call there at all, but was going direct to\r\nhis summer residence at Pillnitz.\r\n\r\nA moment’s reflection showed me that this would only further my desire\r\nof preparing a pleasant and hearty reception for his Majesty. As I was\r\na servant of the Crown, any attempt on my part to render an act of\r\nhomage in Dresden might have had the appearance of an official parade\r\nwhich would not be admissible. I seized the idea, therefore, of\r\nhurriedly collecting together all who could either play or sing, so\r\nthat we might perform a Reception song hastily composed in honour of\r\nthe event. The obstacle to my plan was that my Director Lüttichau was\r\naway at one of his country seats. To come to an understanding with my\r\ncolleague Reissiger would, moreover, have involved delay, and given the\r\nenterprise the very aspect of an official ovation which I wished to\r\navoid. As no time was to be lost, if anything worthy of the occasion\r\nwas to be done—as the King was due to arrive in a few days—I availed\r\nmyself of my position as conductor of the Glee Club, and summoned all\r\nits singers and instrumentalists to my aid. In addition to these, I\r\ninvited the members of our theatrical company, and also those of the\r\norchestra, to join us. This done, I drove quickly to Pillnitz to\r\narrange matters with the Lord Chamberlain, whom I found favourably\r\ndisposed towards my project. The only leisure I could snatch for\r\ncomposing the verses of my song and setting them to music was during\r\nthe rapid drive there and back, for by the time I reached home I had to\r\nhave every thing ready for the copyist and lithographer. The agreeable\r\nsensation of rushing through the warm summer air and lovely country,\r\ncoupled with the sincere affection with which I was inspired for our\r\nGerman Prince, and which had prompted my effort, elated me and worked\r\nme up to a high pitch of tension, in which I now formed a clear\r\nconception of the lyrical outlines of the ‘Tannhäuser March,’ which\r\nfirst saw the light of day on the occasion of this royal welcome. I\r\nsoon afterwards developed this theme, and thus produced the march which\r\nbecame the most popular of the melodies I had hitherto composed.\r\n\r\nOn the next day it had to be tried over with a hundred and twenty\r\ninstrumentalists and three hundred singers. I had taken the liberty of\r\ninviting them to meet me on the stage of the Court Theatre, where\r\neverything went off capitally. Every one was delighted, and I not the\r\nleast so, when a messenger arrived from the director, who had just\r\nreturned to town, requesting an immediate interview. Littichau was\r\nenraged beyond measure at my high-handed proceedings in this matter, of\r\nwhich he had been informed by our good friend Reissiger. If his\r\nbaronial coronet had been on his head during this interview, it would\r\nassuredly have tumbled off. The fact that I should have conducted my\r\nnegotiations in person with the court officials, and could report that\r\nmy endeavours had met with extraordinarily prompt success, aroused his\r\ndeepest fury, for the chief importance of his own position consisted in\r\nalways representing everything which had to be obtained by these means\r\nas surrounded by the greatest obstacles, and hedged in by the strictest\r\netiquette. I offered to cancel everything, but that only embarrassed\r\nhim the more. I thereupon asked him what he wanted me to do, if the\r\nplan was still to be carried out. On this point he seemed uncertain,\r\nbut thought I had shown a great lack of fellow-feeling in having not\r\nonly ignored him, but Reissiger as well. I answered that I was\r\nperfectly ready to hand over my composition and the conducting of the\r\npiece to Reissiger. But he could not swallow this, as he really had an\r\nexceedingly poor opinion of Reissiger, of which I was very well aware.\r\nHis real grievance was that I had arranged the whole business with the\r\nLord Chamberlain, Herr von Reizenstein, who was his personal enemy, and\r\nhe added that I could form no conception of the rudeness he had been\r\nobliged to endure from the hands of this official. This outburst of\r\nconfidence made it easier for me to exhibit an almost sincere emotion,\r\nto which he responded by a shrug of the shoulders, meaning that he must\r\nresign himself to a disagreeable necessity.\r\n\r\nBut my project was even more seriously threatened by the wretched\r\nweather than by this storm with the director; for it rained all day in\r\ntorrents. If it lasted, which it seemed only too likely to do, I could\r\nhardly start on the special boat at five o’clock in the morning, as\r\nproposed, with my hundreds of helpers, to give an early morning concert\r\nat Pillnitz, two hours away. I anticipated such a disaster with genuine\r\ndismay. But Röckel consoled me by saying that I could rely upon it that\r\nwe should have glorious weather the next day; for I was lucky! This\r\nbelief in my luck has followed me ever since, even down to my latest\r\ndays; and amid the great misfortunes which have so often hampered my\r\nenterprises, I have felt as if this statement were a wicked insult to\r\nfate. But this time, at least, my friend was right; the 12th of August,\r\n1844 was from sunrise till late at night the most perfect summer day\r\nthat I can remember in my whole life. The sensation of blissful content\r\nwith which I saw my light-hearted legion of gaily dressed bandsmen and\r\nsingers gathering through the auspicious morning mists on board our\r\nsteamer, swelled my breast with a fervent faith in my lucky star.\r\n\r\nBy my friendly impetuosity I had succeeded in overcoming Reissiger’s\r\nsmouldering resentment, and had persuaded him to share the honour of\r\nour undertaking by conducting the performance of my composition\r\nhimself. When we arrived at the spot, everything went off splendidly.\r\nThe King and royal family were visibly touched, and in the evil times\r\nthat followed the Queen of Saxony spoke of this occasion, I am told,\r\nwith peculiar emotion, as the fairest day of her life. After Reissiger\r\nhad wielded his baton with great dignity, and I had sung with the\r\ntenors in the choir, we two conductors were summoned to the presence of\r\nthe royal family. The King warmly expressed his thanks, while the Queen\r\npaid us the high compliment of saying that I composed very well and\r\nthat Reissiger conducted very well. His Majesty asked us to repeat the\r\nlast three stanzas only, as, owing to a painful ulcerated tooth, he\r\ncould not remain much longer out of doors. I rapidly devised a combined\r\nevolution, the remarkably successful execution of which I am very\r\nproud, even to this day. I had the entire song repeated, but, in\r\naccordance with the King’s wish, only one verse was sung in our\r\noriginal crescent formation. At the beginning of the second verse I\r\nmade my four hundred undisciplined bandsmen and singers file off in a\r\nmarch through the garden, which, as they gradually receded, was so\r\narranged that the final notes could only reach the royal ear as an\r\nechoing dream-song. Thanks to my unexampled activity and ever-present\r\nhelp, this retreat was so steadily carried out that not the slightest\r\nfaltering was perceptible either in time or delivery, and the whole\r\nmight have been taken for a carefully rehearsed theatrical manœuvre. On\r\nreaching the castle court we found that, by the Queen’s kindly\r\nforethought, an ample breakfast had been provided for our party on the\r\nlawn, where the tables were already spread. We often saw our royal\r\nhostess herself busily supervising the attendants, or moving with\r\nexcited delight about the windows and corridors of the castle. Every\r\neye beamed rapture to my soul, as the successful author of the general\r\nhappiness, and I almost felt amid the glories of that day as though the\r\nmillennium had been proclaimed. After roaming in a body through the\r\nlovely grounds of the castle, and not omitting to pay a visit to the\r\nKeppgrund which had been so dear to me in my youth, we returned late at\r\nnight, and in the highest spirits, to Dresden.\r\n\r\nNext morning I was again summoned to the presence of the director. But\r\na change had come over him during the night.\r\n\r\nAs I began to offer my apologies for the anxiety I had caused him, the\r\ntall thin man, with the hard dry face, seized me by the hand and\r\naddressed me with a rapturous expression, which I am sure no one else\r\never saw on his face. He told me to say no more about these anxieties.\r\nI was a great man, and soon no one would know anything about him,\r\nwhereas I should be universally admired and loved. I was deeply moved,\r\nand wished only to express my embarrassment at so unexpected an\r\noutburst, when he kindly interrupted me and sought an escape from his\r\nown emotion in good-humoured confidences. He referred, with a smile, to\r\nthe self-denial which had yielded the place of honour on so\r\nextraordinary an occasion to an undeserving man like Reissiger. When I\r\nassured him that this act had afforded me the liveliest satisfaction,\r\nand that I had myself persuaded my colleague to take the baton, he\r\nconfessed that at last he began to understand me, but failed altogether\r\nto comprehend how the other could accept a position to which he had no\r\nright.\r\n\r\nLüttichau’s altered attitude towards me was such that for some time our\r\nintercourse on matters of business assumed an almost confidential tone.\r\nBut, unfortunately, in course of time things changed for the worse, so\r\nthat our relationship became one of open enmity; nevertheless, a\r\ncertain peculiar tenderness towards me on the part of this singular man\r\nwas always clearly perceptible. Indeed, I might almost say that much of\r\nhis subsequent abuse of me sounded more like the strangely perverted\r\nplaints of a love that met with no response.\r\n\r\nFor my holiday this year I went, early in September, to Fischer’s\r\nvineyard, near Loschwitz, not far from the famous Firidlater vineyard,\r\nwhere, somewhat late in the year, I rented a summer residence. Where\r\nunder the kindly and strengthening stimulus of six week of open-air\r\nlife, I composed my music for the second act of Tannhäuser, which I\r\ncompleted by the 15th of October. During this period a performance of\r\nRienzi was given before an audience of no ordinary importance. For this\r\nevent I went up to town. Spontini, Meyerbeer, and General Lwoff, the\r\ncomposer of the Russian National Anthem, were seated together in a\r\nstage box. I sought no opportunity of learning the impression made by\r\nmy opera upon these learned judges and magnates of the musical world.\r\nIt was enough for me to have the complacent satisfaction of knowing\r\nthat they had heard my oft-repeated work performed before a crowded\r\nhouse and amid overwhelming applause. I was delighted at the close of\r\nthe opera to have my little dog Peps, which had run after me all the\r\nway from the country, brought to me; and without waiting to greet the\r\nEuropean celebrities, I drove off with it at once to our quiet\r\nvineyard, where Minna was greatly relieved to recover her little pet,\r\nwhich for hours she had believed to be lost.\r\n\r\nHere I also received a visit from Werder, the man whose friendship I\r\nhad made in Berlin under such dramatic circumstances. But this time he\r\nappeared in ordinary human guise, beneath the kindly light of heaven,\r\nby which we disputed in a friendly way concerning the true worth of the\r\nFliegender Holländer, my mind having somewhat turned against this work\r\nsince Tannhäuser had got into my head. It certainly seemed odd to find\r\nmyself contradicted on this point by my friend, and to receive\r\ninstruction from him on the significance of my own work.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to our winter quarters I tried to avoid allowing so\r\nlengthy an interval to elapse between the composition of the second and\r\nthird acts as had separated that of the first and second. In spite of\r\nmany absorbing engagements I succeeded in my aim. By carefully\r\ncultivating a habit of taking solitary walks, and thanks to their\r\nsoothing influence over me, I managed to finish the music of Act iii.\r\nby the 29th of December, that is to say, before the end of the year.\r\n\r\nDuring this period my time was otherwise very seriously occupied by a\r\nvisit paid us by Spontini with reference to a proposed presentation of\r\nhis Vestalin, the preparation for which had just begun. The singular\r\nepisodes and characteristic features of the intercourse which I thus\r\ngained with this eminent and hoary-headed master are still so vividly\r\nimprinted on my memory that they seem worthy of a place in this record.\r\n\r\nSince, with the co-operation of Schroder-Devrient, we could, on the\r\nwhole, rely upon an admirable presentation of the opera, I had inspired\r\nLüttichau with the idea of inviting Spontini to undertake the personal\r\nsuperintendence of his justly famous work. He had just left Berlin for\r\never, after enduring great humiliation there, and such an invitation at\r\nthis moment would be a well-timed proof of respect. This was\r\naccordingly sent, and as I had myself been entrusted with the\r\nconductorship of the opera, I was given the singular task of deciding\r\nthis point with the master. My letter, it appears, although written in\r\nFrench, inspired him with a high opinion of my zeal for the enterprise,\r\nand in a gracious reply he informed me what his special wishes were\r\nregarding the arrangements to be made for his collaboration. As far as\r\nthe vocalists were concerned, and seeing that a Schroder-Devrient was\r\namong the number, he frankly expressed his satisfaction. As for chorus\r\nand ballet, he took it for granted that nothing would be lacking to the\r\ndignity of the performance; and finally, as regarded the orchestra, he\r\nexpected that this also would be sure to please him, as he presumed it\r\ncontained the necessary complement of excellent instruments which, to\r\nuse his own words, ‘he hoped would furnish the performance with twelve\r\ngood contrabass!’ (le tout garni de douze bonnes contre-basses). This\r\nphrase bowled me over, for the proportion thus bluntly stated in\r\nfigures gave me so logical a conception of his exalted expectations,\r\nthat I hurried away at once to the director to warn him that the\r\nenterprise on which we had embarked would not, after all, prove as easy\r\nas we thought. His alarm was great, and he said that some plan must at\r\nonce be devised for breaking off the engagement.\r\n\r\nWhen Schroder-Devrient heard of our dilemma, knowing Spontini well, she\r\nlaughed as though she would never stop at the ingenuous impudence with\r\nwhich we had issued our invitation. A trifling indisposition from which\r\nshe then suffered provided a reasonable excuse for a delay, more or\r\nless prolonged, and this she generously placed at our disposal.\r\nSpontini had, in fact, urged us to use all possible despatch in the\r\nexecution of our project, for, as he was impatiently awaited in Paris,\r\nhe could spare us but little time. It fell to my lot to weave the\r\ntissue of innocent deceptions by which we hoped to divert the master\r\nfrom a definite acceptance of our invitation. Now we could breathe\r\nagain, and duly began rehearsing. But on the very day before we\r\nproposed to hold our full-dress rehearsal at our leisure, lo and\r\nbehold! about noon a carriage drove up to my door, in which, clad in a\r\nlong blue coat of pilot-cloth, sat no other than the haughty master\r\nhimself, whose manners resembled those of a Spanish grandee. All\r\nunattended and greatly excited, he entered my room, showed me my\r\nletters, and proved from our correspondence that the invitation had not\r\nbeen declined, but that he had in all points accurately complied with\r\nour wishes. Forgetting for the moment all the possible embarrassments\r\nwhich might arise, in my genuine delight at beholding the wonderful man\r\nbefore me, and hearing his work conducted by himself, I at once\r\nundertook to do everything I possibly could to meet his desires. This\r\ndeclaration I made with the utmost sincerity of zeal. He smiled with\r\nalmost childlike kindliness on hearing me, and I at once begged him to\r\nconduct the rehearsal arranged for the morrow. He thereupon grew\r\nsuddenly thoughtful, and began to weigh the numerous disadvantages of\r\nsuch an action on his part. So acute did his agitation become that he\r\nhad the greatest difficulty in expressing himself clearly on any point,\r\nand I found it no easy matter to inquire what arrangements on our part\r\nwould persuade him to undertake the morrow’s rehearsal. After a\r\nmoment’s reflection he asked what sort of baton I was accustomed to use\r\nwhen conducting. With my hands I indicated the approximate length and\r\nthickness of a medium-sized wooden rod, such as our choir-attendant was\r\nin the habit of supplying, freshly covered with white paper. He sighed,\r\nand asked if I thought it possible to procure him by to-morrow a baton\r\nof black ebony, whose very respectable length and thickness he\r\nindicated by a gesture, and on each end of which a fairly large knob of\r\nivory was to be affixed. I promised to have one prepared for the next\r\nrehearsal, which should at least be similar in appearance to what he\r\ndesired, and another of the specified materials in time for the actual\r\nperformance. Visibly relieved, he then passed his hand over his brow,\r\nand granted me permission to announce his consent to conduct on the\r\nfollowing day. After once more strongly enforcing his instructions as\r\nto the baton, he went back to his hotel.\r\n\r\nI seemed to be moving in a dream, and hastened in a whirl-wind of\r\nexcitement to publish the news of what had happened and was to be\r\nexpected. We were fairly trapped. Schroder-Devrient offered to become\r\nour scapegoat, while I entered into precise details with the theatre\r\ncarpenter concerning the baton. This turned out so far correct that it\r\npossessed the requisite length and breadth, was black in its colour,\r\nand had two large white knobs. Then came the fateful rehearsal.\r\nSpontini was evidently ill at ease on his seat in the orchestra. First\r\nof all he wished to have the oboists placed behind him. As this partial\r\nchange of position just at that moment would have caused much confusion\r\nin the disposition of the orchestra, I promised to effect the\r\nalteration after the rehearsal. He said no more, and took up his baton.\r\nIn a moment I understood why he attached such importance to its form\r\nand size. He held it, not as other conductors do, by the end, but\r\ngripped it about the middle with his clenched fist, waving it so as to\r\nmake it evident that he wielded his baton like a field-marshal’s staff,\r\nnot for beating time, but for command.\r\n\r\nConfusion arose in the very first scene, which was increased by the\r\nfact that the master’s instructions, both to orchestra and singers,\r\nwere rendered almost unintelligible by his confused use of the German\r\nlanguage. This much at least we were soon able to grasp, that he was\r\nparticularly anxious to disabuse us of the idea that this was a\r\nfull-dress rehearsal, and to show us that he was set upon a thorough\r\nre-study of the opera from the very beginning. Great, indeed, was the\r\ndespair of my good old chorus-master and stage manager, Fischer—who\r\nbefore had enthusiastically advocated the invitation of Spontini—when\r\nhe recognised that the dislocation of our repertoire was now\r\ninevitable. This feeling swelled by degrees to open anger, in the\r\nblindness of which every fresh suggestion of Spontini’s appeared but\r\nfrivolous fault-finding, to which he bluntly responded in the coarsest\r\nGerman. After one of the choruses Spontini beckoned me to his side and\r\nwhispered: ‘Mais savez-vous, vos choeurs ne chantent pas mal’;\r\nwhereupon Fischer, regarding this with suspicion, shouted out to me in\r\na rage: ‘What does the old hog want now?’ and I had some trouble to\r\npacify the speedily converted enthusiast.\r\n\r\nBut our most serious delay arose, during the first act, through the\r\nevolutions of a triumphal march. With the most vociferous emphasis the\r\nmaster expressed intense dissatisfaction with the apathetic demeanour\r\nof our populace during the procession of vestal virgins. He was quite\r\nunaware of the fact that, in obedience to our stage manager’s\r\ninstructions, they had fallen on their knees upon the appearance of the\r\npriestesses; for he was so excited, and withal so terribly\r\nshort-sighted, that nothing which appealed to the eye alone was\r\nperceptible to his senses. What he demanded was that the Roman army\r\nshould manifest its devout respect in more drastic fashion by flinging\r\nthemselves as one man to the ground, and marking this by delivering a\r\ncrashing blow of their spears on their shields. Endless attempts were\r\nmade, but some one always clattered either too soon or too late. Then\r\nhe repeated the action himself several times with his baton on the\r\ndesk, but all to no purpose; the crash was not sufficiently sharp and\r\nemphatic. This reminded me of the impression made upon me some years\r\nbefore in Berlin by the wonderful precision and almost alarming effect\r\nwith which I had seen similar evolutions carried out in the play of\r\nFerdinand Cortez, and I realized that it would require an immediate and\r\ntedious accentuation of our customary softness of action in such\r\nmaneouvres before we could meet the fastidious master’s requirements.\r\nAt the end of the first act Spontini went on the stage himself, in\r\norder to give a detailed explanation of his reasons for wishing to\r\ndefer his opera for a considerable time, so as to prepare by\r\nmultitudinous rehearsals for its production in accordance with his\r\ntaste. He expected to find the actors of the Dresden Court Theatre\r\ngathered there to hear him; but the company had already dispersed.\r\nSingers and stage manager had hastily scattered in every direction to\r\ngive vent, each in his own fashion, to the misery of the situation.\r\nNone but the workmen, lamp-cleaners, and a few of the chorus gathered\r\nin a semicircle around Spontini, in order to have a look at that\r\nremarkable man, as he held forth with wonderful effect on the\r\nrequirements of true theatrical art. Turning towards the dismal scene,\r\nI gently and respectfully pointed out to Spontini the uselessness of\r\nhis declamation, and promised that everything should eventually be done\r\nprecisely as he desired.\r\n\r\nFinally, I succeeded in extricating him from the undignified position\r\nin which, to my horror, he had been placed, by telling him that Herr\r\nEduard Devrient, who had seen the Vestalin in Berlin, and carried every\r\ndetail of the performance in his mind, should personally drill our\r\nchorus and supers into a becoming solemnity during the reception of the\r\nvestals. This pacified him, and we proceeded to settle on a plan for a\r\nseries of rehearsals according to his wishes. But, in spite of all\r\nthis, I was the only person to whom this strange turn of affairs was\r\nnot unwelcome; for through the burlesque extravagances of Spontini, and\r\nnotwithstanding his extraordinary eccentricities, which, however, I\r\nlearned in time to understand, I could perceive the miraculous energy\r\nwith which he pursued and attained an ideal of theatrical art such as\r\nin our days had become almost unknown.\r\n\r\nWe began, therefore, with a pianoforte rehearsal, at which the master\r\nmade a point of telling the singers what he wanted. He did not tell us\r\nanything new, however, for he said little about the details of the\r\nrendering; on the other hand, he expatiated upon the general\r\ninterpretation, and I noticed that in doing this, he had accustomed\r\nhimself to make the most decided allowances for the great singers,\r\nespecially Schroder-Devrient and Tichatschek. The only thing he did was\r\nto forbid the latter to use the word Braut (bride) with which Licinius\r\nhad to address Julia in the German translation; this word sounded\r\nhorrible in his ears, and he could not understand how anybody could set\r\nsuch a vulgar sound as that to music. He gave a long lecture, however,\r\nto the somewhat coarse and less talented singer who took the part of\r\nthe high-priest, and explained to him how to understand and interpret\r\nthis character from the dialogue (in recitative) between him and\r\nHaruspex. He told him that he must understand that the whole thing was\r\nbased upon priestcraft and superstition. Pontifex must make it clear\r\nthat he does not fear his antagonist at the head of the Roman army,\r\nbecause, should the worst come to the worst, he has his machines ready,\r\nwhich, if necessary, will miraculously rekindle the dead fire of Vesta.\r\nIn this way, even though Julia should escape the sacrifice, the power\r\nof the priesthood would still be unassailable.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the rehearsals I asked Spontini why he, who, as a rule,\r\nmade such very effective use of the trombone, should have left it\r\nentirely out in the magnificent triumphal march of the first act. Very\r\nmuch astonished he asked: ‘Est-ce que je n’ai pas de trombones?’ I\r\nshowed him the printed score, and he then asked me to add the trombones\r\nto the march, so that, if possible, they might be used at the next\r\nrehearsal. He also said: ‘J’ai entendu dans votre Rienzi un instrument,\r\nque vous appelez Basse-tuba; je ne veux pas bannir cet instrument de\r\nl’orchestre: faites m’en une partie pour la Vestale.’ It gave me great\r\npleasure to perform this task for him with all the care and good\r\njudgment I could dispose of. When at the rehearsal he heard the effect\r\nfor the first time, he threw me a really grateful glance, and so much\r\nappreciated the really simple additions I had made to his score, that a\r\nlittle later on he wrote me a very friendly letter from Paris in which\r\nhe asked me kindly to send him the extra instrumental parts I had\r\nprepared for him. His pride would not allow him, however, to ask\r\noutright for something for which I alone had been responsible, so he\r\nwrote: ‘Envoyez-moi une partition des trombones pour la marche\r\ntriomphale et de la Basse-tuba telle qu’elle a ete executee sous ma\r\ndirection a Dresde.’ Apart from this, I also showed how greatly I\r\nrespected him, in the eagerness with which, at his special request, I\r\nregrouped all the instruments in the orchestra. He was forced to this\r\nrequest more by habit than by principle, and how very important it\r\nseemed to him not to make the slightest change in his customary\r\narrangements, was proved to me when he explained his method of\r\nconducting. He conducted the orchestra, so he said, only with his eyes:\r\n‘My left eye is the first violin, my right eye the second, and if the\r\neye is to have power, one must not wear glasses (as so many bad\r\nconductors do), even if one is short-sighted. I,’ he admitted\r\nconfidentially, ‘cannot see twelve inches in front of me, but all the\r\nsame I can make them play as I want, merely by fixing them with my\r\neye.’ In some respects the arbitrary way in which he used to arrange\r\nhis orchestra was really very irrational. From his old days in Paris he\r\nhad retained the habit of placing the two oboists immediately behind\r\nhim, and although this was a fad which owed its origin to a mere\r\naccident, it was one to which he always adhered. The consequence was\r\nthat these players had to avert the mouthpiece of their instruments\r\nfrom the audience, and our excellent oboist was so angry about this\r\narrangement, that it was only by dint of great diplomacy that I\r\nsucceeded in pacifying him.\r\n\r\nApart from this, Spontini’s method was based upon the absolutely\r\ncorrect system (which even at the present time is misunderstood by some\r\nGerman orchestras) of spreading the string quartette over the whole\r\norchestra. This system further consisted in preventing the brass and\r\npercussion instruments from culminating in one point (and drowning each\r\nother) by dividing them on both sides, and by placing the more delicate\r\nwind instruments at a judicious distance from each other, thus forming\r\na chain between the violins. Even some great and celebrated orchestras\r\nof the present day still retain the custom of dividing the mass of\r\ninstruments into two halves, the string and the wind instruments, an\r\narrangement that denotes roughness and a lack of understanding of the\r\nsound of the orchestra, which ought to blend harmoniously and be well\r\nbalanced.\r\n\r\nI was very glad to have the chance of introducing this excellent\r\nimprovement in Dresden, for now that Spontini himself had initiated it,\r\nit was an easy matter to get the King’s command to let the alteration\r\nstand. Nothing remained after Spontini’s departure but to modify and\r\ncorrect certain eccentricities and arbitrary features in his\r\narrangements; and from that moment I attained a high level of success\r\nwith my orchestra.\r\n\r\nWith all the peculiarities he showed at rehearsals, this exceptional\r\nman fascinated both musicians and singers to such an extent that the\r\nproduction attracted quite an unusual amount of attention. Very\r\ncharacteristic was the energy with which he insisted on exceptionally\r\nsharp rhythmic accents; through his association with the Berlin\r\norchestra he had acquired the habit of marking the note that he wished\r\nto be brought out with the word diese (this), which at first was quite\r\nincomprehensible to me. The great singer Tichatschek, who had a\r\npositive genius for rhythm, was highly pleased by this; for he also had\r\nacquired the habit of compelling the chorus to great precision in very\r\nimportant entries, and maintained that if one only accentuated the\r\nfirst note properly, the rest followed as a matter of course. On the\r\nwhole, therefore, a spirit of devotion to the master gradually pervaded\r\nthe orchestra; the violas alone bore him a grudge for a while, and for\r\nthis reason. In the accompaniment of the lugubrious cantilena of Julia\r\nat the end of the second act, he would not put up with the way in which\r\nthe violas played the horribly sentimental accompaniment. Suddenly\r\nturning towards them he called in a sepulchral tone, ‘Are the violas\r\ndying?’ The two pale and incurably melancholy old men who held on\r\ntenaciously to their posts in the orchestra, notwithstanding their\r\nright to a pension, stared at Spontini with real fright, reading a\r\nthreat in his words, and I had to explain Spontini’s wish in sober\r\nlanguage in order to call them back to life.\r\n\r\nOn the stage Herr Eduard Devrient helped very materially in bringing\r\nabout wonderfully distinct ensembles; he also knew how to gratify a\r\ncertain wish of Spontini’s, which threw us all into tremendous\r\nconfusion. In accordance with the cuts adopted by all the German\r\ntheatres, we too ended the opera with the fiery duet, supported by the\r\nchorus, between Licinius and Julia after their rescue. The master,\r\nhowever, insisted on adding a lively chorus and ballet to the finale,\r\naccording to the antiquated method of ending common to French opera\r\nseria. He was absolutely against finishing his work with a dismal\r\nchurchyard episode; consequently the whole scene had to be altered.\r\nVenus was to shine resplendent in a rose bower, and the long-suffering\r\nlovers were to be wedded at her altar, amid lively dancing and singing,\r\nby rose-bedecked priests and priestesses. We performed it like this,\r\nbut unluckily not with the success we had all hoped for.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the production, which was proceeding with wonderful\r\naccuracy and verve, we came across a difficulty with regard to the\r\nprincipal part for which none of us had been prepared. Our great\r\nSchroder-Devrient was obviously no longer of an age to give the desired\r\neffect as the youngest of the vestal virgins; she had acquired matronly\r\ncontours, and her age was moreover accentuated by the extremely\r\ngirlish-looking high-priestess with whom she had to act, and whose\r\nyouth it was difficult to dissimulate. This was my niece, Johanna\r\nWagner, who, because of her marvellous voice and great talent as an\r\nactress, made every one in the audience long to see the parts of the\r\ntwo women reversed. Schroder-Devrient, who was well aware of this fact,\r\ntried by every effective means in her power to overcome her most\r\ndifficult position; this effort, however, resulted not infrequently in\r\ngreat exaggeration and straining of the voice, and in one very\r\nimportant place her part was sadly overacted. When, after the great\r\ntrio in the second act, she had to gasp the words, ‘er ist frei’ (‘he\r\nis free’), and to move away from her rescued lover towards the front of\r\nthe stage, she made the mistake of speaking the words instead of\r\nsinging them.\r\n\r\nShe had often proved the effect of a decisive word uttered with an\r\nexaggerated and yet careful imitation of the ordinary accents of the\r\nspoken language, by exciting the audience’s wildest enthusiasm when she\r\nalmost whispered the words, ‘Noch einen Schritt und du bist todt!’\r\n(‘Just one more step and thou art dead!’) in Fidelia. This terrific\r\neffect, which I too had felt, was produced by the shock—like unto the\r\nblow of an executioner’s axe—which I received on suddenly coming down\r\nfrom the ideal sphere to which music itself can exalt the most awful\r\nsituations, to the naked surface of dreadful reality. This sensation\r\nwas due simply to the knowledge of the utmost height of the sublime,\r\nand the memory of the impression I received led me to call that\r\nparticular moment the moment of lightning; for it was as if two\r\ndifferent worlds that meet, and yet are divided, were suddenly\r\nillumined and revealed as by a flash. Thoroughly to understand such a\r\nmoment, and not to treat it wrongly, was the whole secret, and this I\r\nfully realised on that day from the absolute failure on the great\r\nsinger’s part to produce the right effect. The toneless, hoarse way in\r\nwhich she uttered the words was like throwing cold water over the\r\naudience and myself, and not one of those present could see any more in\r\nthe incident than a botched theatrical effect. It is possible that the\r\npublic had expected too much, for they were curious to see Spontini\r\nconduct, and the prices had been raised accordingly; it may also have\r\nbeen that the whole style of the work, with its antiquated French plot,\r\nseemed rather obsolete in spite of the majestic beauty, of the music;\r\nor, perhaps, the very tame end left the same cold impression as\r\nDevrient’s dramatic failure. In any case there was no real enthusiasm,\r\nand the only sign of approval was a rather lukewarm call for the\r\ncelebrated master, who, covered with numerous decorations, made a sad\r\nimpression on me as he bowed his thanks to the audience for their very\r\nmoderate applause.\r\n\r\nNobody was less blind to the somewhat disappointing result than\r\nSpontini himself. He decided, however, to defy fate, and to this end\r\nhad recourse to means which he had often employed in Berlin, in order\r\nto get packed houses for his operatic productions. Thus, he always gave\r\nSunday performances, for experience had taught him that he could always\r\nhave a full house on that day. As the next Sunday on which his Vestalin\r\nwas to be produced was still some time ahead, his prolonged stay gave\r\nus several more chances of enjoying his interesting company. I have\r\nsuch a vivid recollection of the hours spent with him either at Madame\r\nDevrient’s or at my house, that I shall be pleased to quote a few\r\nreminiscences.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget a dinner at Schroder-Devrient’s house at which we\r\nhad a charming conversation with Spontini and his wife (a sister of the\r\ncelebrated pianoforte maker, Erard). Spontini generally listened\r\ndeferentially to what the others had to say, his attitude being that of\r\na man who expected to be asked for his opinion. When he did speak in\r\nthe end it was with a sort of rhetorical solemnity, in sharp and\r\nprecise sentences, categorical and well accentuated, which forbade\r\ncontradiction from the outset. Herr Ferdinand Hiller was among the\r\ninvited guests, and he began to speak about Liszt. After some time\r\nSpontini gave his opinion in his characteristic fashion, but in a\r\nspirit which showed only too clearly, that from the heights of his\r\nBerlin throne he had not judged the affairs of the world either with\r\nimpartiality or goodwill. While he was laying down the law in this\r\nstyle he could not brook any interruption. When, therefore, during the\r\ndessert, the general conversation became livelier, and Madame Devrient\r\nhappened to laugh with her neighbour at the table in the middle of a\r\nlong harangue of Spontini’s, he shot an extremely angry glance at his\r\nwife. Madame Devrient apologised for her at once by saying that it was\r\nshe (Madame Devrient) who had been laughing about some lines on a\r\n_bonbonnière_, whereupon Spontini retorted: _‘Pourtant je suis sûr que\r\nc’est ma femme qui a suscité ce rire; je ne veux pas que l’on rie\r\ndevant moi, je ne rie jamais moi, j’aime le sérieux.’_ In spite of that\r\nhe sometimes succeeded in being jovial. For instance, it amused him to\r\nset us all wondering at the way in which he crunched enormous lumps of\r\nsugar with his marvellous teeth. After dinner, when we drew our chairs\r\ncloser together, he usually became very excited.\r\n\r\nAs far as he was capable of affection he seemed really to like me; he\r\ndeclared openly that he loved me, and said that he would prove this\r\nbest by trying to keep me from the misfortune of proceeding in my\r\ncareer as a dramatic composer. He said he knew it would be difficult to\r\nconvince me of the value of this friendly service, but as he felt it\r\nhis sacred duty to look after my happiness in this particular line, he\r\nwas prepared to stay in Dresden for another half-year, during which\r\nperiod he suggested that we should produce his other operas, and\r\nespecially _Agnes von Hohenstaufen_, under his direction. To explain\r\nhis views about the fatal mistake of trying to succeed as a dramatic\r\ncomposer ‘after Spontini,’ he began by praising me in these terms:\r\n_‘Quand j’ai entendu votre Rienzi, j’ai dit, c’est un homme de génie,\r\nmais déjà il a plus fait qu’il ne peut faire.’_ In order to show me\r\nwhat he meant by this paradox, he proceeded as follows: _‘Après Gluck\r\nc’est moi qui ai fait la grande révolution avec la_ Vestale; _j’ai\r\nintroduit le_ Vorhalt _de la sexte’_ (the suspension of the sixth)\r\n_‘dans l’harmonie et la grosse caisse dans l’orchestre; avec_ Cortez\r\n_j’ai fait un pas de plus en avant; puis j’ai fait trois pas avec_\r\nOlympic. Nurmahal, Alcidor _et tout ce que j’ai fait dans les premiers\r\ntemps à Berlin, je vous les livre, c’étaient des œuvres occasionnelles;\r\nmais depuis j’ai fait cent pas en avant avec_ Agnès de Hohenstaufen,\r\n_où j’ai imaginé un emploi de l’orchestre remplacant parfaitement\r\nl’orgue.’_\r\n\r\nSince then he had tried his hand at a new work, Les Atheniennes; the\r\nCrown Prince (now King of Prussia[13]) had urged him to finish this\r\nwork, and to testify to the truth of his words, he took several letters\r\nwhich he had received from this monarch out of his pocket-book, and\r\nhanded them to us for inspection. Not until he had insisted upon our\r\nreading them carefully through did he continue by saying that, in spite\r\nof this flattering invitation, he had given up the idea of setting this\r\nexcellent subject to music, because he felt sure he could never surpass\r\nhis Agnes von Hohenstaufen, nor invent anything new. In conclusion he\r\nsaid: ‘Or, comment voulez-vous que quiconque puisse inventer quelque\r\nchose de nouveau, moi Spontini declarant ne pouvoir en aucune facon\r\nsurpasser mes œuvres precedentes, d’autre part etant avise que depuis\r\nla Vestale il n’a point ete ecrit une note qui ne fut volee de mes\r\npartitions.’\r\n\r\n [13] William the First.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo prove that this assertion was not merely talk, but that it was based\r\non scientific investigations, he quoted his wife, who was supposed to\r\nhave read with him an elaborate discussion on the subject by a\r\ncelebrated member of the French academy, and he added that the essay in\r\nquestion had, for some mysterious reason, never been printed. In this\r\nvery important and scientific treatise it was proved that without\r\nSpontini’s invention of the suspension of the sixth in his Vestalin,\r\nthe whole of modern melody would not have existed, and that any and\r\nevery form of melody that had been used since had been borrowed from\r\nhis compositions. I was thunderstruck, but hoped all the same to bring\r\nthe inexorable master to a better frame of mind, especially in regard\r\nto certain reservations he had made. I acknowledged that the\r\nacademician in question was right in many ways, but I asked him if he\r\ndid not believe that if somebody brought him a dramatic poem full of an\r\nabsolutely new and hitherto unknown spirit, it would not inspire him to\r\ninvent new musical combinations? With a ring of compassion in his\r\nvoice, he replied that my question was wholly mistaken; in what would\r\nthe novelty consist? ‘Dans la Vestale j’ai compose un sujet romain,\r\ndans Ferdinand Cortez un sujet espagnol-mexicain, dans Olympic un sujet\r\ngreco-macedonien, enfin dans Agnes de Hohenstaufen un sujet allemand:\r\ntout le reste ne vaut rien!’ He hoped that I was not thinking of the\r\nso-called romantic style a la Freischutz? With such childish stuff no\r\nserious man could have anything to do; for art was a serious thing, and\r\nhe had exhausted serious art! And, after all, what nation could produce\r\nthe composer who could surpass HIM? Surely not the Italians, whom he\r\ncharacterised simply as cochons; certainly not the French, who had only\r\nimitated the Italians; nor the Germans, who would never get beyond\r\ntheir childhood in music, and who, if they had ever possessed any\r\ntalent, had had it all spoilt for them by the Jews? ‘Oh, croyez-moi, il\r\ny avait de l’espoir pour l’Allemagne lorsque j’etais empereur de la\r\nmusique a Berlin; mais depuis que le roi de Prusse a livre sa musique\r\nau desordre occasionne par les deux juifs errants qu’il a attires, tout\r\nespoir est perdu.’\r\n\r\nOur charming hostess now thought it time to change the subject, and to\r\ndivert the master’s thoughts. The theatre was situated quite near to\r\nher house; she invited him to go across with our friend Heine, who was\r\namongst the guests, and to have a look at Antigone, which was then\r\nbeing given, and which was sure to interest him on account of the\r\nantique equipment of the stage, which had been carried out according to\r\nSemper’s excellent plans. At first he wanted to refuse, on the plea\r\nthat he had seen all this so much better when his Olympia had been\r\nperformed. After a while he consented; but in a very short time he\r\nreturned to his original opinion, and, smiling scornfully, assured us\r\nthat he had seen and heard enough to strengthen him in his verdict.\r\nHeine told us that shortly after he and Spontini had taken their seats\r\nin the almost empty amphitheatre, and as soon as the Bacchus chorus had\r\nstarted, Spontini had said to him: ‘C’est de la Berliner Sing-Academie,\r\nallons-nous-en.’ Through an open door a streak of light had fallen on a\r\nlonely figure behind one of the columns; Heine had recognised\r\nMendelssohn, and concluded that he had overheard Spontini’s remark.\r\n\r\nFrom the master’s very excited conversations we soon realised very\r\ndistinctly that he intended to stay longer in Dresden, so as to get all\r\nhis operas performed. It was Schroder-Devrient’s idea to save Spontini,\r\nin his own interest, from the mortifying disappointment of finding all\r\nhis enthusiastic hopes in regard to a second performance of Vestalin\r\nunfounded, and, if possible, to prevent this second performance during\r\nhis stay in Dresden. She pretended to be ill, and the director\r\nrequested me to inform Spontini of the fact that his production would\r\nhave to be indefinitely postponed. This visit was so distasteful to me,\r\nthat I was glad to make it in Röckel’s company. He was also a friend of\r\nSpontini’s, and his French was moreover much better than mine. As we\r\nwere quite prepared for a bad reception, we were really frightened to\r\nenter. Imagine, therefore, our astonishment when we found the master,\r\nwho had already been informed of the news in a letter from Devrient, in\r\nthe very brightest spirits.\r\n\r\nHe told us that he had to leave immediately for Paris, and that from\r\nthere he was to travel to Rome, the Holy Father having commanded him to\r\ncome in order to receive the title of ‘Count of San Andrea.’ Then he\r\nshowed us a second document, in which the King of Denmark was supposed\r\nto have raised him to the Danish nobility. This meant, however, only\r\nthat the title of ‘Ritter’ of the ‘Elephanten-Order’ had been conferred\r\nupon him; and although this was indeed a high honour, in speaking about\r\nit he only mentioned the word ‘Ritter’ without referring to the\r\nparticular order, because this seemed to him too ordinary for a person\r\nof his dignity. He was, however, childishly pleased over the affair,\r\nand felt that he had been miraculously rescued from the narrow sphere\r\nof his Dresden Vestalin production to find himself suddenly transported\r\ninto regions of glory, from which he looked down upon the distressing\r\n‘opera’ world with sublime self-content.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Röckel and I silently thanked the Holy Father and the King of\r\nDenmark from the bottom of our hearts. We bode an affectionate farewell\r\nto the strange master, and to cheer him I promised him seriously to\r\nthink over his friendly advice with regard to my career as a composer\r\nof opera.\r\n\r\nLater on I heard what Spontini had said about me, on hearing that I had\r\nfled from Dresden for political reasons, and had sought refuge in\r\nSwitzerland. He thought that this was in consequence of my share in a\r\nplot of high treason against the King of Saxony, whom he looked upon as\r\nmy benefactor, because I had been nominated conductor of the royal\r\norchestra, and he expressed his opinion about me by ejaculating in\r\ntones of the deepest anguish: ‘Quelle ingratitude!’\r\n\r\nFrom Berlioz, who was at Spontini’s deathbed until the end, I heard\r\nthat the master had struggled most determinedly against death, and had\r\ncried repeatedly, ‘Je ne veux pas mourir, je ne veux pas mourir!’ When\r\nBerlioz tried to comfort him by saying, ‘Comment pouvez-vous penser\r\nmourir vous, mon maître, qui etes immortel!’ Spontini retorted angrily,\r\n‘Ne faites pas de mauvaises plaisanteries!’ In spite of all the\r\nextraordinary experiences I had had with him, the news of his death,\r\nwhich I received in Zürich, touched me very deeply. Later on I\r\nexpressed my feelings towards him, and my opinion of him as an artist,\r\nin a somewhat condensed form in the Eidgenossischen Zeitung, and in\r\nthis article the quality I extolled more particularly in him was that,\r\nunlike Meyerbeer, who was then the rage, and the very aged Rossini, he\r\nbelieved absolutely in himself and his art. All the same, and somewhat\r\nto my disgust, I could not but see that this belief in himself had\r\ndeteriorated into a veritable superstition.\r\n\r\nI do not remember in those days having gone deeply into my feelings\r\nabout Spontini’s exceedingly strange individuality, nor do I recollect\r\nhaving troubled to discover how far they were consistent with the high\r\nopinion I formed of him after I had got to know him more intimately.\r\nObviously I had only seen the caricature of the man, although the\r\ntendency towards such plainly overweening self-confidence may, at all\r\nevents, have manifested itself earlier in life. At the same time, one\r\ncould trace in all this the influence of the decay of the musical and\r\ndramatic life of the period, which Spontini, situated as he was in\r\nBerlin, was well able to witness. The surprising fact that he saw his\r\nchief merit in unessential details showed plainly that his judgment had\r\nbecome childish; in my opinion this did not detract from the great\r\nvalue of his works, however much he might exaggerate their value. In a\r\nsense I could justify his boundless self-confidence, which was\r\nprincipally the outcome of the comparison between himself and the great\r\ncomposers who were now replacing him; for in my heart of hearts I\r\nshared the contempt which he felt for these artists, although I did not\r\ndare to say so openly. And thus it came about that, in spite of his\r\nmany somewhat absurd idiosyncrasies, I learned during this meeting at\r\nDresden to feel a deep sympathy for this man, the like of whom I was\r\nnever again to meet.\r\n\r\nMy next experiences of important musical celebrities of this age were\r\nof quite a different character. Amongst the more distinguished of these\r\nwas Heinrich Marschner, who, as a very young man, had been nominated\r\nmusical director of the Dresden orchestra by Weber. After Weber’s death\r\nhe seemed to have hoped that he would take his place entirely, and it\r\nwas due less to the fact that his talent was still unknown, than to his\r\nrepellent manner, that he was disappointed in his expectations. His\r\nwife, however, suddenly came into some money, and this windfall enabled\r\nhim to devote all his energies to his work as composer of operas,\r\nwithout being obliged to fill any fixed post.\r\n\r\nDuring the wild days of my youth Marschner lived in Leipzig, where his\r\noperas Der Vampir and Templer und Judin saw their first appearance. My\r\nsister Rosalie had once taken me to him in order to hear his opinion\r\nabout me. He did not treat me uncivilly, but my visit led to nothing. I\r\nwas also present at the first night of his opera Des Falkner’s Braut,\r\nwhich however was not a success. Then he went to Hanover. His opera\r\nHans Heiling, which was originally produced in Berlin, I heard for the\r\nfirst time in Wurzburg; it showed vacillation in its tendency, and a\r\ndecrease in constructive power. After that he produced several other\r\noperas, such as Das Schloss am Aetna and Der Babu, which never became\r\npopular. He was always neglected by the management at Dresden, as\r\nthough they bore him some grudge, and only his Templer was played at\r\nall often. My colleague, Reissiger, had to conduct this opera, and as\r\nin his absence I always had to take his place, it also fell to my lot\r\non one occasion to direct a performance of this work.\r\n\r\nThis was during the time that I worked at my Tannhäuser. I remember\r\nthat, although I had often conducted this opera before in Magdeburg, on\r\nthis occasion the wild nature of the instrumentation and its lack of\r\nmastership affected me to such an extent that it literally made me ill,\r\nand as soon as he returned, therefore, I implored Reissiger at any cost\r\nto resume the leadership. On the other hand, immediately after my\r\nnomination I had started on the production of Hans Heiling, but merely\r\nfor the sake of the artistic honour. The insufficient distribution of\r\nthe parts, however, a difficulty which in those days could not be\r\novercome, made a complete success impossible. In any case, though, the\r\nwhole spirit of the work seemed to be terribly old-fashioned.\r\n\r\nI now heard that Marschner had finished another opera called Adolph von\r\nNassau, and in a criticism of this work, of the genuineness of which I\r\nwas unable to judge, particular stress was laid upon the ‘patriotic and\r\nnoble German atmosphere’ of this new creation. I did my best to make\r\nthe Dresden theatre take the initiative, and to urge Lüttichau to\r\nsecure this opera before it was produced elsewhere. Marschner, who did\r\nnot seem to have been treated with particular consideration by the\r\nHanoverian opera authorities, accepted the invitation with great joy,\r\nsent his score, and declared himself willing to come to Dresden for the\r\nfirst performance. Lüttichau, however, was not anxious to see him take\r\nhis place at the head of the orchestra; while I, also, was of the\r\nopinion that the too frequent appearance of outside conductors, even if\r\nit were for the purpose of conducting their own works, would not only\r\nlead to confusion, but might also fail to be as amusing and instructive\r\nas Spontini’s visit had proved to be. It was therefore decided that I\r\nshould conduct the new opera myself. And how I lived to regret it!\r\n\r\nThe score arrived: to a weak plot by Karl Golmick the composer of the\r\nTempler had written such superficial music, that the principal effect\r\nlay in a drinking song for a quartette, in which the German Rhine and\r\nGerman wine played the usual stereotyped part peculiar to such male\r\nquartettes. I lost all courage; but we had to go on with it now, and\r\nall I could do was to try, by maintaining a grave bearing, to make the\r\nsingers take an interest in their task; this, however, was not easy. To\r\nTichatschek and Mitterwurzer were assigned the two principal male\r\nparts; being both eminently musical, they sang everything at first\r\nsight, and after each number looked up at me as if to say, ‘What do you\r\nthink of it all?’ I maintained that it was good German music; they must\r\nnot allow themselves to get confused. But all they did was to stare at\r\neach other in amazement, not knowing what to make of me. Nevertheless,\r\nin the end they could not stand it any longer, and when they saw that I\r\nstill retained my gravity, they burst into loud laughter, in which I\r\ncould not help joining.\r\n\r\nI now had to take them into my confidence, and make them promise to\r\nfollow my lead and pretend to be serious, for it was impossible to give\r\nup the opera at this stage. A Viennese ‘colorature’ singer of the\r\nlatest style—Madame Spatser Gentiluomo—who came to us from Hanover, and\r\non whose services Marschner greatly relied, was rather taken with her\r\npart chiefly because it gave her the chance of showing ‘brilliancy.’\r\nAnd, indeed, there was a finale in which my ‘German master’ had\r\nactually tried to steal a march on Donizetti. The Princess had been\r\npoisoned by a golden rose, a present from the wicked Bishop of Mainz,\r\nand had become delirious. Adolph von Nassau, with the knights of the\r\nGerman empire, swears vengeance, and, accompanied by the chorus, pours\r\nout his feelings in a stretta of such incredible vulgarity and\r\namateurishness that Donizetti would have thrown it at the head of any\r\nof his pupils who had dared to compose such a thing. Marschner now\r\narrived for the dress rehearsal; he was very pleased, and, without\r\ncompelling me to falsehood, he gave me sufficient opportunities for\r\nexercising my powers in the art of concealing my real thoughts. At all\r\nevents I must have succeeded fairly well, for he had every reason to\r\nthink himself considerately and kindly treated by me.\r\n\r\nDuring the performance the public behaved very much as the singers had\r\ndone at the rehearsals. We had brought a still-born child into the\r\nworld. But Marschner was comforted by the fact that his drinking\r\nquartette was encored. This was reminiscent of one of Becker’s songs:\r\nSie sollen ihn nicht haben, den freien deutschen Rhein (‘They shall not\r\nhave it, our free German Rhine’). After the performance the composer\r\nwas my guest at a supper party at which, I am sorry to say, the\r\nsingers, who had had enough of it, would not attend. Herr Ferdinand\r\nHiller had the presence of mind to insist, in his toast to Marschner,\r\nthat ‘whatever one might say, all stress must be laid on the GERMAN\r\nmaster and GERMAN art.’ Strangely enough, Marschner himself\r\ncontradicted him by saying that there was something wrong with German\r\noperatic compositions, and that one ought to consider the singers and\r\nhow to write more brilliantly for their voices than he had succeeded in\r\ndoing up to the present.\r\n\r\nHighly gifted as Marschner was, there can be no doubt that the decline\r\nof his genius was due partly to a tendency which even in the ageing\r\nmaster himself, as he frankly admitted, was effecting an important and\r\nmost salutary change. In later years I met him once more in Paris at\r\nthe time of my memorable production of Tannhäuser. I did not feel\r\ninclined to renew the old relations, for, to tell the truth, I wanted\r\nto spare myself the unpleasantness of witnessing the consequences of\r\nhis change of views, of which we had seen the beginning in Dresden. I\r\nlearned that he was in a state of almost helpless childishness, and\r\nthat he was in the hands of a young and ambitious woman, who was trying\r\nto make a last attempt at conquering Paris for him. Among other puff\r\nparagraphs calculated to spread Marschner’s glory, I read one which\r\nsaid that the Parisians must not believe that I (Wagner) was\r\nrepresentative of German art; no—if only Marschner were given a\r\nhearing, it would be discovered that he was beyond a doubt better\r\nsuited to the French taste than I could ever be. Marschner died before\r\nhis wife had succeeded in establishing this point.\r\n\r\nFerdinand Hiller, on the other hand, who was in Dresden, behaved in a\r\nvery charming and friendly manner, particularly at this time. Meyerbeer\r\nalso stayed in the same town from time to time; precisely why, nobody\r\nknew. Once he had rented a little house for the summer near the\r\nPirnaischer Schlag, and under a pretty tree in the garden of this place\r\nhe had had a small piano installed, whereon, in this idyllic retreat,\r\nhe worked at his Feldlager in Schlesien. He lived in great retirement,\r\nand I saw very little of him. Ferdinand Hiller, on the contrary, took a\r\ncommanding position in the Dresden musical world in so far as this was\r\nnot already monopolised by the royal orchestra and its masters, and for\r\nmany years he worked hard for its success. Having a little private\r\ncapital, he established himself comfortably amongst us, and was soon\r\nknown as a delightful host, who kept a pleasant house, which, thanks to\r\nhis wife’s influence, was frequented by a numerous Polish colony. Frau\r\nHiller was indeed an exceptional Jewish woman of Polish origin, and she\r\nwas perhaps all the more exceptional seeing that she, in company with\r\nher husband, had been baptized a Protestant in Italy. Hiller began his\r\ncareer in Dresden with the production of his opera, Der Traum in der\r\nChristnacht. Since the unheard-of fact that Rienzi had been able to\r\nrouse the Dresden public to lasting enthusiasm, many an opera composer\r\nhad felt himself drawn towards our ‘Florence on the Elbe,’ of which\r\nLaube once said that as soon as one entered it one felt bound to\r\napologise because one found so many good things there which one\r\npromptly forgot the moment one departed.\r\n\r\nThe composer of Der Traum in der Christnacht looked upon this work as a\r\npeculiarly ‘German composition.’ Hiller had set to music a gruesome\r\nplay by Raupach, Der Muller und sein Kind (‘The Miller and his Child’),\r\nin which father and daughter, within but a short space of time, both\r\ndie of consumption. He declared that he had conceived the dialogue and\r\nthe music of this opera in what he called the ‘popular style,’ but this\r\nwork met with the same fate as that which, according to Liszt, befell\r\nall his compositions. In spite of his undoubted musical merits, which\r\neven Rossini acknowledged, and whether he gave them in French in Paris\r\nor in Italian in Italy, it was his sad experience always to see his\r\noperas fail. In Germany he had tried the Mendelssohnian style, and had\r\nsucceeded in composing an oratorio called Die Zerstorung Jerusalems,\r\nwhich luckily was not taken notice of by the moody theatre-going\r\npublic, and which consequently received the unassailable reputation of\r\nbeing ‘a solid German work.’ He also took Mendelssohn’s place as\r\ndirector of the Leipzig Gewandhaus concerts when the latter was called\r\nto Berlin in the capacity of general director. Hiller’s evil fortune\r\nstill pursued him, however, and he was unable to retain his position,\r\neverybody being given to understand that it was because his wife was\r\nnot sufficiently acknowledged as concert prima-donna. Mendelssohn\r\nreturned and made Hiller leave, and Hiller boasted of having quarrelled\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nDresden and the success of my Rienzi now weighed so much upon his mind\r\nthat he naturally made another attempt to succeed as an opera composer.\r\nOwing to his great energy, and to his position as son of a rich banker\r\n(a special attraction even to the director of a court theatre), it\r\nhappened that he induced them to put aside my poor friend Röckel’s\r\nFarinelli (the production of which had been promised him) in favour of\r\nhis (Hiller’s) own work, Der Traum in der Christnacht. He was of the\r\nopinion that next to Reissiger and myself, a man of greater musical\r\nreputation than Röckel was needed. Lüttichau, however, was quite\r\ncontent to have Reissiger and myself as celebrities, particularly as we\r\ngot on so well together, and he remained deaf to Hiller’s wishes. To me\r\nDer Traum in der Christnacht was a great nuisance. I had to conduct it\r\na second time, and before an empty house. Hiller now saw that he had\r\nbeen wrong in not taking my advice before, and in not shortening the\r\nopera by one act and altering the end, and he now fancied that he was\r\ndoing me a great favour by at last declaring himself ready to act on my\r\nsuggestion in the event of another performance of his opera being\r\npossible. I really managed to have it played once more. This was,\r\nhowever, to be the last time, and Hiller, who had read my book of\r\nTannhäuser, thought that I had a great advantage over him in writing my\r\nown words. He therefore made me promise to help him with the choice and\r\nwriting of a subject for his next opera.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Hiller was present at a performance of Rienzi, which\r\nwas again given before a crowded and enthusiastic house. When, at the\r\nend of the second act, and after frantic recalls from the audience, I\r\nleft the orchestra in a great state of excitement, Hiller, who was\r\nwaiting for me in the passage, took the opportunity of adding to his\r\nvery hasty congratulations, ‘Do give my Traum once more!’ I promised\r\nhim laughingly to do this if I had the chance, but I cannot remember\r\nwhether it came off or not. While he was waiting for the creation of an\r\nentirely new plot for his next opera, Hiller devoted himself to the\r\nstudy of chamber music, to which his large and well-furnished room lent\r\nitself most admirably.\r\n\r\nA beautiful and solemn event added to the seriousness of the mood in\r\nwhich I finished the music to Tannhäuser towards the end of the year,\r\nand neutralised the more superficial impressions made upon me by the\r\nstirring events above described. This was the removal of the remains of\r\nCarl Maria von Weber from London to Dresden in December, 1844. As I\r\nhave already said, a committee had for years been agitating for this\r\nremoval. From information given by a certain traveller, it had become\r\nknown that the insignificant coffin which contained Weber’s ashes had\r\nbeen disposed of in such a careless way in a remote corner of St.\r\nPaul’s, that it was feared it might soon become impossible to identify\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMy energetic friend, Professor Lowe, whom I have already mentioned, had\r\navailed himself of this information in order to urge the Dresden Glee\r\nClub, which constituted his hobby, to take the matter in hand. The\r\nconcert of male singers arranged to this end had been a fair success\r\nfinancially, and they now wanted to induce the theatre management to\r\nmake similar efforts, when suddenly they met with serious opposition\r\nfrom this very quarter. The management of the Dresden theatre told the\r\ncommittee that the King had religious scruples with regard to\r\ndisturbing the peace of the dead. However much we felt inclined to\r\ndoubt the genuineness of these reasons, nothing could be done, and I\r\nwas next approached on the subject, in the hope that my influential\r\nposition might lend weight to my appeal. I entered into the spirit of\r\nthe enterprise with great fervour. I consented to be made president;\r\nHerr Hofrat Schulz, director of the ‘Antiken-Cabinet,’ who was a\r\nwell-known authority on artistic matters, and another gentleman, a\r\nChristian banker, were also elected members of the committee, and the\r\nmovement thus received fresh life. Prospectuses were sent round,\r\nexhaustive plans were made, and numerous meetings held. Here, again, I\r\nmet with opposition on the part of my chief, Lüttichau; if he could\r\nhave done so, he would have forbidden me to move in the matter by\r\nmaking the most of the King’s scruples referred to above. But he had\r\nhad a warning not to pick a quarrel with me after his experience in the\r\nsummer, when, contrary to his expectations, the music written by me to\r\ncelebrate the King’s arrival had found favour with the monarch. As his\r\nantipathy to the proceedings was not so very serious, Lüttichau must\r\nhave seen that even the direct opposition of his Majesty could not have\r\nprevented the enterprise from being carried out privately, and that, on\r\nthe contrary, the court would cut a sorry figure if the Royal Court\r\nTheatre (to which Weber once belonged) should assume a hostile\r\nattitude. He therefore tried in a would-be friendly way to make me\r\ndesist from furthering the cause, well knowing that, without me, the\r\nplan would fail. He tried to convince me that it would be wrong to pay\r\nthis exaggerated honour to Weber’s memory, whereas nobody thought of\r\nremoving the ashes of Morlacchi from Italy, although the latter had\r\ngiven his services to the royal orchestra for a much longer period than\r\nWeber had done. What would be the consequence? By way of argument he\r\nsaid, ‘Suppose Reissiger died on his journey to some watering-place—his\r\nwife would then be as much justified as was Frau von Weber (who had\r\nannoyed him quite enough already) in expecting her husband’s dead body\r\nto be brought home with music and pomp.’ I tried to calm him, and if I\r\ndid not succeed in making him see the difference between Reissiger and\r\nWeber, I managed to make him understand that the affair must take its\r\ncourse, as the Berlin Court Theatre had already announced a benefit\r\nperformance to support our undertaking.\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer, to whom my committee had applied, was instrumental in\r\nbringing this about, and a performance of Euryanthe was actually given\r\nwhich yielded the handsome balance of six thousand marks. A few\r\ntheatres of lesser importance now followed our lead. The Dresden Court\r\nTheatre, therefore, could not hold back any longer, and as we now had a\r\nfairly large sum at the bank, we were able to cover the expenses of the\r\nremoval, as well as the cost of an appropriate vault and monument; we\r\neven had a nucleus fund for a statue of Weber, which we were to fight\r\nfor later on. The elder of the two sons of the immortal master\r\ntravelled to London to fetch the remains of his father. He brought them\r\nby boat down the Elbe, and finally arrived at the Dresden\r\nlanding-stage, from whence they were to be conducted to German soil.\r\nThis last journey of the remains was to take place at night. A solemn\r\ntorchlight procession was to be formed, and I had undertaken to see to\r\nthe funeral music.\r\n\r\nI arranged this from two motives out of Euryanthe, using that part of\r\nthe music in the overture which relates to the vision of spirits. I\r\nintroduced the Cavatina from Euryanthe—Hier dicht am Quell (‘Here near\r\nthe source’), which I left unaltered, except that I transposed it into\r\nB flat major, and I finished the whole, as Weber finished his opera, by\r\na return to the first sublime motive. I had orchestrated this symphonic\r\npiece, which was well suited to the purpose, for eight chosen wind\r\ninstruments, and notwithstanding the volume of sound, I had not\r\nforgotten softness and delicacy of instrumentation. I substituted the\r\ngruesome tremolo of the violas, which appears in that part of the\r\noverture adapted by me, by twenty muffled drums, and as a whole\r\nattained to such an exceedingly impressive effect, especially to us who\r\nwere full of thoughts of Weber, that, even in the theatre where we\r\nrehearsed, Schroder-Devrient, who was present, and who had been an\r\nintimate friend of Weber’s, was deeply moved. I had never carried out\r\nanything more in keeping with the character of the subject; and the\r\nprocession through the town was equally impressive.\r\n\r\nAs the very slow tempo, devoid of any strongly marked accents, offered\r\nnumerous difficulties, I had had the stage cleared for the rehearsal,\r\nin order to command a sufficient space for the musicians, once they had\r\nthoroughly practised the piece, to walk round me in a circle playing\r\nall the while. Several of those who witnessed the procession from their\r\nwindows assured me that the effect of the procession was indescribably\r\nand sublimely solemn. After we had placed the coffin in the little\r\nmortuary chapel of the Catholic cemetery in Friedrichstadt, where\r\nMadame Devrient met it with a wreath of flowers, we performed, on the\r\nfollowing morning, the solemn ceremony of lowering it into the vault.\r\nHerr Hofrat Schulz and myself, as presidents of the committee, were\r\nallowed the honour of speaking by the graveside, and what afforded me\r\nan appropriate subject for the few, somewhat affecting, words which I\r\nhad to pronounce, was the fact that, shortly before the removal of\r\nWeber’s remains, the second son of the master, Alexander von Weber, had\r\ndied. The poor mother had been so terribly affected by the sudden death\r\nof this youth, so full of life and health, that had we not been in the\r\nvery midst of our arrangements, we should have been compelled to\r\nabandon them; for in this new loss the widow saw a judgment of God who,\r\nin her opinion, looked upon the removal of the remains as an act of\r\nsacrilege prompted by vanity. As the public seemed particularly\r\ndisposed to hold the same view, it fell to my lot to set the nature of\r\nour undertaking in the proper light before the eyes of the world. And\r\nthis I so far succeeded in doing that, to my satisfaction, I learned\r\nfrom all sides that my justification of our action had received the\r\nmost general acceptance.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion I had a strange experience with regard to myself, when\r\nfor the first time in my life I had to deliver a solemn public speech.\r\nSince then I have always spoken extemporarily; this time, however, as\r\nit was my first appearance as an orator, I had written out my speech,\r\nand carefully learned it by heart. As I was thoroughly under the\r\ninfluence of my subject, I felt so sure of my memory that I never\r\nthought of making any notes. Thanks to this omission, however, I made\r\nmy brother Albert very unhappy. He was standing near me at the\r\nceremony, and he told me afterwards that, in spite of being deeply\r\nmoved, he felt at one moment as if he could have sworn at me for not\r\nhaving asked him to prompt me. It happened in this way: I began my\r\nspeech in a clear and full voice, but suddenly the sound of my own\r\nwords, and their particular intonation, affected me to such an extent\r\nthat, carried away as I was by my own thoughts, I imagined I SAW as\r\nwell as HEARD myself before the breathless multitude. While I thus\r\nappeared objectively to myself I remained in a sort of trance, during\r\nwhich I seemed to be waiting for something to happen, and felt quite a\r\ndifferent person from the man who was supposed to be standing and\r\nspeaking there. It was neither nervousness nor absent-mindedness on my\r\npart; only at the end of a certain sentence there was such a long pause\r\nthat those who saw me standing there must have wondered what on earth\r\nto think of me. At last my own silence and the stillness round me\r\nreminded me that I was not there to listen, but to speak. I at once\r\nresumed my discourse, and I spoke with such fluency to the very end\r\nthat the celebrated actor, Emil Devrient, assured me that, apart from\r\nthe solemn service, he had been deeply impressed simply from the\r\nstandpoint of a dramatic orator.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony concluded with a poem written and set to music by myself,\r\nand, though it presented many difficulties for men’s voices, it was\r\nsplendidly rendered by some of the best opera singers. Lüttichau, who\r\nwas present, was now not only convinced of the justice of the\r\nenterprise, but also strongly in favour of it. I was deeply thankful\r\nthat everything had succeeded so well, and when Weber’s widow, upon\r\nwhom I called after the ceremony, told me how profoundly she, too, had\r\nbeen moved, the only cloud that still darkened my horizon was\r\ndispelled. In my youth I had learned to love music through my\r\nadmiration for Weber’s genius, and the news of his death was a terrible\r\nblow to me. To have, as it were, come into contact with him again and\r\nafter so many years by this second funeral, was an event that stirred\r\nthe very depths of my being.\r\n\r\nFrom all the particulars I have given concerning my intimacy with the\r\ngreat masters who were my contemporaries, it is easy to see at what\r\nsources I had been able to quench my thirst for intellectual\r\nintercourse. It was not a very satisfactory outlook to turn from\r\nWeber’s grave to his living successors; but I had still to find out how\r\nabsolutely hopeless this was.\r\n\r\nI spent the winter of 1844-5 partly in yielding to attractions from\r\noutside, and partly in indulging in the deepest meditation. By dint of\r\ngreat energy, and by getting up very early, even in winter, I succeeded\r\nin completing my score to Tannhäuser early in April, having, as already\r\nstated, finished the composition of it at the end of the preceding\r\nyear. In writing down the orchestration I made things particularly\r\ndifficult for myself by using the specially prepared paper which the\r\nprinting process renders necessary, and which involved me in all kinds\r\nof trying formalities. I had each page transferred to the stone\r\nimmediately, and a hundred copies printed from each, hoping to make use\r\nof these proofs for the rapid circulation of my work. Whether my hopes\r\nwere to be fulfilled or not, I was at all events fifteen hundred marks\r\nout of pocket when all the expenses of the publication were paid.\r\n\r\nIn regard to this work which called for so many sacrifices, and which\r\nwas so slow and difficult, more details will appear in my\r\nautobiography. At all events, when May came round I was in possession\r\nof a hundred neatly bound copies of my first new work since the\r\nproduction of the Fliegender Holländer, and Hiller, to whom I showed\r\nsome parts of it, formed a tolerably good impression of its value.\r\n\r\nThese plans for rapidly spreading the fame of my Tannhäuser were made\r\nwith the hope of a success which, in view of my needy circumstances,\r\nseemed ever more and more desirable. In the course of one year since I\r\nhad begun my own publication of my operas, much had been done to this\r\nend. In September of the year 1844 I had presented the King of Saxony\r\nwith a special richly bound copy of the complete pianoforte arrangement\r\nof Rienzi, dedicated to his Majesty. The Fliegender Holländer had also\r\nbeen finished, and the pianoforte arrangement of Rienzi for duet, as\r\nwell as some songs selected from both operas, had either been published\r\nor were about to be published. Apart from this I had had twenty-five\r\ncopies made of the scores of both these operas by means of the\r\nso-called autographic transfer process, although only from the writing\r\nof the copyists. All these heavy expenses made it absolutely imperative\r\nthat I should try to send my scores to the different theatres, and\r\ninduce them to produce my operas, as the outlay on the piano scores had\r\nbeen heavy, and these could only have a sale if my works got to be\r\nknown sufficiently well through the theatre.\r\n\r\nI now sent the score of my Rienzi to the more important theatres, but\r\nthey all returned my work to me, the Munich Court Theatre even sending\r\nit back unopened! I therefore knew what to expect, and spared myself\r\nthe trouble of sending my Dutchman. From a speculative business point\r\nof view the situation was this: the hoped-for success of Tannhäuser\r\nwould bring in its wake a demand for my earlier works. The worthy\r\nMeser, my agent, who was the music publisher appointed to the court,\r\nhad also begun to feel a little doubtful, and saw that this was the\r\nonly thing to do. I started at once on the publication of a pianoforte\r\narrangement of Tannhäuser, preparing it myself while Röckel undertook\r\nthe Fliegender Holländer, and a certain Klink did Rienzi.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that Meser was absolutely opposed to was the title of my\r\nnew opera, which I had just named Der Venusberg; he maintained that, as\r\nI did not mix with the public, I had no idea what horrible jokes were\r\nmade about this title. He said the students and professors of the\r\nmedical school in Dresden would be the first to make fun of it, as they\r\nhad a predilection for that kind of obscene joke. I was sufficiently\r\ndisgusted by these details to consent to the change. To the name of my\r\nhero, Tannhäuser, I added the name of the subject of the legend which,\r\nalthough originally not belonging to the Tannhäuser myth, was thus\r\nassociated with it by me, a fact which later on Simrock, the great\r\ninvestigator and innovator in the world of legend, whom I esteemed so\r\nhighly, took very much amiss.\r\n\r\nTannhäuser und der Sangerkrieg auf Wartburg should henceforth be its\r\ntitle, and to give the work a mediaeval appearance I had the words\r\nspecially printed in Gothic characters upon the piano arrangement, and\r\nin this way introduced the work to the public.\r\n\r\nThe extra expenses this involved were very heavy; but I went to great\r\npains to impress Meser with my belief in the success of my work. So\r\ndeeply were we involved in this scheme, and so great were the\r\nsacrifices it had compelled us to make, that there was nothing else for\r\nit but to trust to a special turn of Fortune’s wheel. As it happened,\r\nthe management of the theatre shared my confidence in the success of\r\nTannhäuser. I had induced Lüttichau to have the scenery for Tannhäuser\r\npainted by the best painters of the great opera house in Paris. I had\r\nseen their work on the Dresden stage: it belonged to the style of\r\nGerman scenic art which was then fashionable, and really gave the\r\neffect of first-class work.\r\n\r\nThe order for this, as well as the necessary negotiations with the\r\nParisian painter, Desplechin, had already been settled in the preceding\r\nautumn. The management agreed to all my wishes, even to the ordering of\r\nbeautiful costumes of mediaeval character designed by my friend Heine.\r\nThe only thing Lüttichau constantly postponed was the order for the\r\nHall of Song on the Wartburg; he maintained that the Hall for Kaiser\r\nKarl the Great in Oberon, which had only recently been delivered by\r\nsome French painters, would answer the purpose just as well. With\r\nsuperhuman efforts I had to convince my chief that we did not want a\r\nbrilliant throne-room, but a scenic picture of a certain character such\r\nas I saw before my mind’s eye, and that it could be painted only\r\naccording to my directions. As in the end I became very irritable and\r\ncross, he soothed me by saying that he had no objection to having this\r\nscene painted, and that he would order it to be commenced at once,\r\nadding that he had not agreed immediately, only with the view of making\r\nmy joy the greater, because, what one obtained without difficulty, one\r\nrarely appreciated. This Hall of Song was fated to cause me great\r\ntrouble later on.\r\n\r\nThus everything was in full swing; circumstances were favourable, and\r\nseemed to cast a hopeful light upon the production of my new work at\r\nthe beginning of the autumn season. Even the public was looking forward\r\nto it, and for the first time I saw my name mentioned in a friendly\r\nmanner in a communication to the Allgemeine Zeitung. They actually\r\nspoke of the great expectations they had of my new work, the poem of\r\nwhich had been written ‘with undoubted poetic feeling.’\r\n\r\nFull of hope, I started in July on my holiday, which consisted of a\r\njourney to Marienbad in Bohemia, where my wife and I intended to take\r\nthe cure. Again I found myself on the ‘volcanic’ soil of this\r\nextraordinary country, Bohemia, which always had such an inspiring\r\neffect on me. It was a marvellous summer, almost too hot, and I was\r\ntherefore in high spirits. I had intended to follow the easy-going mode\r\nof life which is a necessary part of this somewhat trying treatment,\r\nand had selected my books with care, taking with me the poems of\r\nWolfram von Eschenbach, edited by Simrock and San Marte, as well as the\r\nanonymous epic Lohengrin, with its lengthy introduction by Gorres. With\r\nmy book under my arm I hid myself in the neighbouring woods, and\r\npitching my tent by the brook in company with Titurel and Parcival, I\r\nlost myself in Wolfram’s strange, yet irresistibly charming, poem.\r\nSoon, however, a longing seized me to give expression to the\r\ninspiration generated by this poem, so that I had the greatest\r\ndifficulty in overcoming my desire to give up the rest I had been\r\nprescribed while partaking of the water of Marienbad.\r\n\r\nThe result was an ever-increasing state of excitement. Lohengrin, the\r\nfirst conception of which dates from the end of my time in Paris, stood\r\nsuddenly revealed before me, complete in every detail of its dramatic\r\nconstruction. The legend of the swan which forms such an important\r\nfeature of all the many versions of this series of myths that my\r\nstudies had brought to my notice, exercised a singular fascination over\r\nmy imagination.\r\n\r\nRemembering the doctor’s advice, I struggled bravely against the\r\ntemptation of writing down my ideas, and resorted to the most strange\r\nand energetic methods. Owing to some comments I had read in Gervinus’s\r\nHistory of German Literature, both the Meistersinger von Nurnberg and\r\nHans Sachs had acquired quite a vital charm for me. The Marker alone,\r\nand the part he takes in the Master-singing, were particularly pleasing\r\nto me, and on one of my lonely walks, without knowing anything\r\nparticular about Hans Sachs and his poetic contemporaries, I thought\r\nout a humorous scene, in which the cobbler—as a popular\r\nartisan-poet—with the hammer on his last, gives the Marker a practical\r\nlesson by making him sing, thereby taking revenge on him for his\r\nconventional misdeeds. To me the force of the whole scene was\r\nconcentrated in the two following points: on the one hand the Marker,\r\nwith his slate covered with chalk-marks, and on the other Hans Sachs\r\nholding up the shoes covered with his chalk-marks, each intimating to\r\nthe other that the singing had been a failure. To this picture, by way\r\nof concluding the second act, I added a scene consisting of a narrow,\r\ncrooked little street in Nuremberg, with the people all running about\r\nin great excitement, and ultimately engaging in a street brawl. Thus,\r\nsuddenly, the whole of my Meistersinger comedy took shape so vividly\r\nbefore me, that, inasmuch as it was a particularly cheerful subject,\r\nand not in the least likely to over-excite my nerves, I felt I must\r\nwrite it out in spite of the doctor’s orders. I therefore proceeded to\r\ndo this, and hoped it might free me from the thrall of the idea of\r\nLohengrin; but I was mistaken; for no sooner had I got into my bath at\r\nnoon, than I felt an overpowering desire to write out Lohengrin, and\r\nthis longing so overcame me that I could not wait the prescribed hour\r\nfor the bath, but when a few minutes elapsed, jumped out and, barely\r\ngiving myself time to dress, ran home to write out what I had in my\r\nmind. I repeated this for several days until the complete sketch of\r\nLohengrin was on paper.\r\n\r\nThe doctor then told me I had better give up taking the waters and\r\nbaths, saying emphatically that I was quite unfit for such cures. My\r\nexcitement had grown to such an extent that even my efforts to sleep as\r\na rule ended only in nocturnal adventures. Among some interesting\r\nexcursions that we made at this time, one to Eger fascinated me\r\nparticularly, on account of its association with Wallenstein and of the\r\npeculiar costumes of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn mid-August we travelled back to Dresden, where my friends were glad\r\nto see me in such good spirits; as for myself, I felt as if I had\r\nwings. In September, when all our singers had returned from their\r\nsummer holidays, I resumed the rehearsals of Tannhäuser with great\r\nearnestness. We had now got so far, at least with the musical part of\r\nthe performance, that the possible date of the production seemed quite\r\nclose at hand. Schroder-Devrient was one of the first to realise the\r\nextraordinary difficulties which the production of Tannhäuser would\r\nentail. And, indeed, she saw these difficulties so clearly that, to my\r\ngreat discomfiture, she was able to lay them all before me. Once, when\r\nI called upon her, she read the principal passages aloud with great\r\nfeeling and force, and then she asked me how I could have been so\r\nsimple-minded as to have thought that so childish a creature as\r\nTichatschek would be able to find the proper tones for Tannhäuser. I\r\ntried to bring her attention and my own to bear upon the nature of the\r\nmusic, which was written so clearly in order to bring out the necessary\r\naccent, that, in my opinion, the music actually spoke for him who\r\ninterpreted the passage, even if he were only a musical singer and\r\nnothing more. She shook her head, saying that this would be all right\r\nin the case of an oratorio.\r\n\r\nShe now sang Elizabeth’s prayer from the piano score, and asked me if I\r\nreally thought that this music would answer my intentions if sung by a\r\nyoung and pretty voice without any soul or without that experience of\r\nlife which alone could give the real expression to the interpretation.\r\nI sighed and said that, in that case, the youthfulness of the voice and\r\nof its owner must make up for what was lacking: at the same time, I\r\nasked her as a favour to see what she could do towards making my niece,\r\nJohanna, understand her part. All this, however, did not solve the\r\nTannhäuser problem, for any effort at teaching Tichatschek would only\r\nhave resulted in confusion. I was therefore obliged to rely entirely\r\nupon the energy of his voice, and on the singer’s peculiarly sharp\r\n‘speaking’ tone.\r\n\r\nDevrient’s anxiety about the principal parts arose partly out of\r\nconcern about her own. She did not know what to do with the part of\r\nVenus; she had undertaken it for the sake of the success of the\r\nperformance, for although a small part, so much depended upon its being\r\nideally interpreted! Later on, when the work was given in Paris, I\r\nbecame convinced that this part had been written in too sketchy a\r\nstyle, and this induced me to reconstruct it by making extensive\r\nadditions, and by supplying all that which I felt it lacked. For the\r\nmoment, however, it looked as if no art on the part of the singer could\r\ngive to this sketch anything of what it ought to represent. The only\r\nthing that might have helped towards a satisfactory impersonation of\r\nVenus would have been the artist’s confidence in her own great physical\r\nattraction, and in the effect it would help to produce by appealing to\r\nthe purely material sympathies of the public. The certainty that these\r\nmeans were no longer at her disposal paralysed this great singer, who\r\ncould hide her age and matronly appearance no longer. She therefore\r\nbecame self-conscious, and unable to use even the usual means for\r\ngaining an effect. On one occasion, with a little smile of despair, she\r\nexpressed herself incapable of playing Venus, for the very simple\r\nreason that she could not appear dressed like the goddess. ‘What on\r\nearth am I to wear as Venus?’ she exclaimed. ‘After all, I cannot be\r\nclad in a belt alone. A nice figure of fun I should look, and you would\r\nlaugh on the wrong side of your face!’\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I still built my hopes upon the general effect of the\r\nmusic alone, the great promise of which at the rehearsals greatly\r\nencouraged me. Hiller, who had looked through the score and had already\r\npraised it, assured me that the instrumentation could not have been\r\ncarried out with greater sobriety. The characteristic and delicate\r\nsonority of the orchestra delighted me, and strengthened me in my\r\nresolve to be extremely sparing in the use of my orchestral material,\r\nin order to attain that abundance of combinations which I needed for my\r\nlater works.\r\n\r\nAt the rehearsal my wife alone missed the trumpets and trombones that\r\ngave such brightness and freshness to Rienzi. Although I laughed at\r\nthis, I could not help feeling anxious when she confided to me how\r\ngreat had been her disappointment when, at the theatre rehearsal, she\r\nnoticed the really feeble impression made by the music of the\r\nSangerkrieg. Speaking from the point of view of the public, who always\r\nwant to be amused or stirred in some way or other, she had thus very\r\nrightly called attention to an exceedingly questionable side of the\r\nperformance. But I saw at once that the fault lay less with the\r\nconception than with the fact that I had not controlled the production\r\nwith sufficient care.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the conception of this scene I was literally on the horns\r\nof a dilemma, for I had to decide once for all whether this Sangerkrieg\r\nwas to be a concert of arias or a competition in dramatic poetry. There\r\nare many people even nowadays, who, in spite of having witnessed a\r\nperfectly successful production of this scene, have not received the\r\nright impression of its purport. Their idea is that it belongs to the\r\ntraditional operatic ‘genre,’ which demands that a number of vocal\r\nevolutions shall be juxtaposed or contrasted, and that these different\r\nsongs are intended to amuse and interest the audience by means of their\r\npurely musical changes in rhythm and time on the principle of a concert\r\nprogramme, i.e. by various items of different styles. This was not at\r\nall my idea: my real intention was, if possible, to force the listener,\r\nfor the first time in the history of opera, to take an interest in a\r\npoetical idea, by making him follow all its necessary developments. For\r\nit was only by virtue of this interest that he could be made to\r\nunderstand the catastrophe, which in this instance was not to be\r\nbrought about by any outside influence, but must be the outcome simply\r\nof the natural spiritual processes at work. Hence the need of great\r\nmoderation and breadth in the conception of the music; first, in order\r\nthat according to my principle it might prove helpful rather than the\r\nreverse to the understanding of the poetical lines, and secondly, in\r\norder that the increasing rhythmic character of the melody which marks\r\nthe ardent growth of passion may not be interrupted too arbitrarily by\r\nunnecessary changes in modulation and rhythm. Hence, too, the need of a\r\nvery sparing use of orchestral instruments for the accompaniment, and\r\nan intentional suppression of all those purely musical effects which\r\nmust be utilised, and that gradually, only when the situation becomes\r\nso intense that one almost ceases to think, and can only feel the\r\ntragic nature of the crisis. No one could deny that I had contrived to\r\nproduce the proper effect of this principle the moment I played the\r\nSangerkrieg on the piano. With the view of ensuring all my future\r\nsuccesses, I was now confronted with the exceptional difficulty of\r\nmaking the opera singers understand how to interpret their parts\r\nprecisely in the way I desired. I remembered how, through lack of\r\nexperience, I had neglected properly to superintend the production of\r\nthe Fliegender Holländer, and as I now fully realised all the\r\ndisastrous consequences of this neglect, I began to think of means by\r\nwhich I could teach the singers my own interpretation. I have already\r\nstated that it was impossible to influence Tichatschek, for if he were\r\nmade to do things he could not understand, he only became nervous and\r\nconfused. He was conscious of his advantages. He knew that with his\r\nmetallic voice he could sing with great musical rhythm and accuracy,\r\nwhile his delivery was simply perfect. But, to my great astonishment, I\r\nwas soon to learn that all this did not by any means suffice; for, to\r\nmy horror, at the first performance, that which had strangely escaped\r\nmy notice in the rehearsals became suddenly apparent to me. At the\r\nclose of the Sangerkrieg, when Tannhäuser (in frantic excitement, and\r\nforgetful of everybody present) has to sing his praise to Venus, and I\r\nsaw Tichatschek moving towards Elizabeth and addressing his passionate\r\noutburst to her, I thought of Schroder-Devrient’s warning in very much\r\nthe same way as Croesus must have thought when he cried, ‘O Solon!\r\nSolon!’ at the funeral pyre. In spite of the musical excellence of\r\nTichatschek, the enormous life and melodic charm of the Sangerkrieg\r\nfailed entirely.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I succeeded in calling into life an entirely new\r\nelement such as probably had never been seen in opera! I had watched\r\nthe young baritone Mitterwurzer with great interest in some of his\r\nparts—he was a strangely reticent man, and not at all sociably\r\ninclined, and I had noticed that his delightfully mellow voice\r\npossessed the rare quality of bringing out the inner note of the soul.\r\nTo him I entrusted Wolfram, and I had every reason to be satisfied with\r\nhis zeal and with the success of his studies. Therefore, if I wished my\r\nintention and method to become known, especially in regard to this\r\ndifficult Sangerkrieg, I had to rely on him for the proper execution of\r\nmy plans and everything they involved. I began by going through the\r\nopening song of this scene with him; but, after I had done my utmost to\r\nmake him understand how I wanted it done, I was surprised to find how\r\nvery difficult this particular rendering of the music appeared to him.\r\nHe was absolutely incapable of repeating it after me, and with each\r\nrenewed effort his singing became so commonplace and so mechanical that\r\nI realised clearly that he had not understood this piece to be anything\r\nmore than a phrase in recitative form, which he might render with any\r\ninflections of the voice that happened to be prescribed, or which might\r\nbe sung either this way or that, according to fancy, as was usual in\r\noperatic pieces. He, too, was astonished at his own want of capacity,\r\nbut was so struck by the novelty and the justice of my views, that he\r\nbegged me not to try any more for the present, but to leave him to find\r\nout for himself how best to become familiar with this newly revealed\r\nworld. During several rehearsals he only sang in a whisper in order to\r\nget over the difficulty, but at the last rehearsal he acquitted himself\r\nso admirably of his task, and threw himself into it so heartily, that\r\nhis work has remained to this day as my most conclusive reason for\r\nbelieving that, in spite of the unsatisfactory state of the world of\r\nopera to-day, it is possible not only to find, but also properly to\r\ntrain, the singer whom I should regard as indispensable for a correct\r\ninterpretation of my works. It was through the impression made by\r\nMitterwurzer that I ultimately succeeded in making the public\r\nunderstand the whole of my work. This man, who had utterly changed\r\nhimself in bearing, look, and appearance in order to fit himself to the\r\nrole of Wolfram, had, in thus solving the problem, not only become a\r\nthorough artist, but by his interpretation of his part had also proved\r\nhimself my saviour at the very moment when my work was threatening to\r\nfail through the unsatisfactory result of the first performance.\r\n\r\nBy his side the part of Elizabeth made a sweet impression. The youthful\r\nappearance of my niece, her tall and slender form, the decidedly German\r\ncast of her features, as well as the incomparable beauty of her voice,\r\nwith its expression of almost childlike innocence, helped her to gain\r\nthe hearts of the audience, even though her talent was more theatrical\r\nthan dramatic. She soon rose to fame by her impersonation of this part,\r\nand often in later years, when speaking about Tannhäuser performances\r\nin which she had appeared, people used to tell me that its success had\r\nbeen entirely due to her. Strange to say, in such reports people\r\nreferred principally to the charm of her acting at the moment when she\r\nreceived the guests in the Wartburg Hall; and I used to account for\r\nthis by remembering the untiring efforts with which my talented brother\r\nand I had trained her to perform this very part. And yet it was never\r\npossible to make her understand the proper interpretation of the prayer\r\nin the third act, and I felt inclined to say, ‘O Solon! Solon!’ as I\r\nhad done in the case of Tichatschek, when after the first performance I\r\nwas obliged to make a considerable cut in this solo, a proceeding which\r\ngreatly reduced its importance for ever afterwards. I heard later that\r\nJohanna, who for a short period actually had the reputation of being a\r\ngreat singer, had never succeeded in singing the prayer as it ought to\r\nbe sung, whereas a French singer, Mademoiselle Marie Sax, achieved this\r\nin Paris to my entire satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of October we had so far progressed with our\r\nrehearsals that nothing stood in the way of an immediate production of\r\nTannhäuser save the scenery, which was not yet complete. A few only of\r\nthe scenes ordered from Paris had arrived, and even these had come very\r\nlate. The Wartburg Valley was beautifully effective and perfect in\r\nevery detail. The inner part of the Venusberg, however, gave me much\r\nanxiety: the painter had not understood me; he had painted clusters of\r\ntrees and statues, which reminded one of Versailles, and had placed\r\nthem in a wild cave; he had evidently not known how to combine the\r\nweird with the alluring. I had to insist on extensive alterations, and\r\nchiefly on the painting out of the shrubs and statues, all of which\r\nrequired time. The grotto had to lie half hidden in a rosy cloud,\r\nthrough which the Wartburg Valley had to loom in the distance; this was\r\nto be done in strict obedience to my own ideas.\r\n\r\nThe greatest misfortune, however, was to befall me in the shape of the\r\ntardy delivery of the scenery for the Hall of Song. This was due to\r\ngreat negligence on the part of the Paris artists; and we waited and\r\nwaited until every detail of the opera had been studied and studied\r\nagain ad nauseam. Daily I went to the railway station and examined all\r\nthe packages and boxes that had arrived, but there was no Hall of Song.\r\nAt last I allowed myself to be persuaded not to postpone the first\r\nperformance any longer, and I decided to use the Hall of Karl the Great\r\nout of Oberon, originally suggested to me by Lüttichau, instead of the\r\nreal thing. Considering the importance I attached to practical effect,\r\nthis entailed a great sacrifice of my personal feelings. And true\r\nenough, when the curtain rose for the second act, the reappearance of\r\nthis throne-room, which the public had seen so often, added\r\nconsiderably to the general disappointment of the audience, who had\r\nanticipated astonishing surprises in this opera.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of October the first performance took place. In the morning\r\nof that day a very beautiful young lady was introduced to me by the\r\nleader Lipinsky. Her name was Mme. Ivalergis, and she was a niece of\r\nthe Russian Chancellor, Count von Nesselrode. Liszt had spoken to her\r\nabout me with such enthusiasm that she had travelled all the way to\r\nDresden especially to hear the first production of my new work. I\r\nthought I was right in regarding this flattering visit as a good omen.\r\nBut although on this occasion she turned away from me, somewhat\r\nperplexed and disappointed by the very unintelligible performance and\r\nthe somewhat doubtful reception with which it met, I had sufficient\r\ncause in after-years to know how deeply this remarkable and energetic\r\nwoman had nevertheless been impressed.\r\n\r\nA great contrast to this visit was one I received from a peculiar man\r\ncalled C. Gaillard. He was the editor of a Berlin musical paper, which\r\nhad only just started, and in which I had read with great astonishment\r\nan entirely favourable and important criticism of my Fliegender\r\nHolländer. Although necessity had compelled me to remain indifferent to\r\nthe attitude of the critics, yet this particular notice gave me much\r\npleasure, and I had invited my unknown critic to come and hear the\r\nfirst production of Tannhäuser in Dresden.\r\n\r\nThis he did, and I was deeply touched to find that I had to deal with a\r\nyoung man who, in spite of being threatened by consumption, and being\r\nalso exceedingly badly off, had come at my invitation, simply from a\r\nsense of duty and honour, and not with any mercenary motive. I saw from\r\nhis knowledge and capacities that he would never be able to attain a\r\nposition of great influence, but his kindness of heart and his\r\nextraordinarily receptive mind filled me with a feeling of profound\r\nrespect for him. A few years later I was very sorry to hear that he had\r\nat last succumbed to the terrible disease from which I knew him to be\r\nsuffering; for to the very end he remained faithful and devoted to me,\r\nin spite of the most trying circumstances.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I had renewed my acquaintance with the friend I had won\r\nthrough the production of the Fliegender Holländer in Berlin, and who\r\nfor a long time I had never had an opportunity of knowing more\r\nthoroughly. The second time I met her was at Schroder-Devrient’s, with\r\nwhom she was already on friendly terms, and of whom she used to speak\r\nas ‘one of my greatest conquests.’\r\n\r\nShe was already past her first youth, and had no beauty of feature\r\nexcept remarkably penetrating and expressive eyes that showed the\r\ngreatness of soul with which she was gifted. She was the sister of\r\nFrommann, the bookseller of Jena, and could relate many intimate facts\r\nabout Goethe, who had stayed at her brother’s house when he was in that\r\ntown. She had held the position of reader and companion to the Princess\r\nAugusta of Prussia, and had thus become intimately acquainted with her,\r\nand was regarded by her own association as almost a bosom friend and\r\nconfidante of that great lady. Nevertheless, she lived in extreme\r\npoverty, and seemed proud of being able, by means of her talent as a\r\npainter of arabesques, to secure for herself some sort of independence.\r\nShe always remained faithfully devoted to me, as she was one of the few\r\nwho were uninfluenced by the unfavourable impression produced by the\r\nfirst performance of Tannhäuser, and promptly expressed her\r\nappreciation of my latest work with the greatest enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the production itself the conclusions I drew from it\r\nwere as follows: the real faults in the work, which I have already\r\nmentioned incidentally, lay in the sketchy and clumsy portrayal of the\r\npart of Venus, and consequently of the whole of the introductory scene\r\nof the first act. In consequence of this defect the drama never even\r\nrose to the level of genuine warmth, still less did it attain to the\r\nheights of passion which, according to the poetic conception of the\r\npart, should so strongly work upon the feelings of the audience as to\r\nprepare them for the inevitable catastrophe in which the scene\r\nculminates, and thus lead up to the tragic denouement. This great scene\r\nwas a complete failure, in spite of the fact that it was entrusted to\r\nso great an actress as Schroder-Devrient, and a singer so unusually\r\ngifted as Tichatschek. The genius of Devrient might yet have struck the\r\nright note of passion in the scene had she not chanced to be acting\r\nwith a singer incapable of all dramatic seriousness, and whose natural\r\ngifts only fitted him for joyous or declamatory accents, and who was\r\ntotally incapable of expressing pain and suffering. It was not until\r\nWolfram’s touching song and the closing scene of this act were reached\r\nthat the audience showed any signs of emotion. Tichatschek wrought such\r\na tremendous effect in the concluding phrase by the jubilant music of\r\nhis voice that, as I was afterwards informed, the end of this first act\r\nleft the audience in a great state of enthusiasm. This was maintained,\r\nand even exceeded in the second act, during which Elizabeth and Wolfram\r\nmade a very sympathetic impression. It was only the hero of Tannhäuser\r\nwho continued to lose ground, and at last so completely failed to hold\r\nthe audience that in the final scene he almost broke down himself in\r\ndejection, as though the failure of Tannhäuser were his own. The fatal\r\ndefect of his performance lay in his inability to find the right\r\nexpression for the theme of the great Adagio passage of the finale\r\nbeginning with the words: ‘To lead the sinner to salvation, the\r\nHeaven-sent messenger drew near.’ The importance of this passage I have\r\nexplained at length in my subsequent instructions for the production of\r\nTannhäuser. Indeed, owing to Tichatschek’s absolutely expressionless\r\nrendering, which made it seem terribly long and tedious, I had to omit\r\nit entirely from the second performance. As I did not wish to offend so\r\ndevoted and, in his way, so deserving a man as Tichatschek, I let it be\r\nunderstood I had come to the conclusion that this theme was a failure.\r\nMoreover, as Tichatschek was thought to be an actor chosen by myself to\r\ntake the parts of the heroes in my works, this passage, which was so\r\nimmeasurably vital to the opera, continued to be omitted in all the\r\nsubsequent productions of Tannhäuser, as though this proceeding had\r\nbeen approved and demanded by me. I therefore cherished no illusions\r\nabout the value of the subsequent universal success of this opera on\r\nthe German stage. My hero, who, in rapture as in woe, should always\r\nhave asserted his feelings with boundless energy, slunk away at the end\r\nof the second act with the humble bearing of a penitent sinner, only to\r\nreappear in the third with a demeanour designed to awaken the\r\ncharitable sympathy of the audience. His pronunciation of the Pope’s\r\nexcommunication, however, was rendered with his usual full rhetorical\r\npower, and it was refreshing to hear his voice dominating the\r\naccompanying trombones. Granted that this radical defect in the hero’s\r\nacting had left the public in a doubtful and unsatisfied state of\r\nsuspense regarding the meaning of the whole, yet the mistake in the\r\nexecution of the final scene, arising from my own inexperience in this\r\nnew field of dramatic creation, undoubtedly contributed to produce a\r\nchilling uncertainty as to the true significance of the scenic action.\r\nIn my first complete version I had made Venus, on the occasion of her\r\nsecond attempt to recall her faithless lover, appear in a vision to\r\nTannhäuser when he is in a frenzy of madness, and the awfulness of the\r\nsituation, is merely suggested by a faint roseate glow upon the distant\r\nHorselberg. Even the definite announcement of Elizabeth’s death was a\r\nsudden inspiration on the part of Wolfram. This idea I intended to\r\nconvey to the listening audience solely by the sound of bells tolling\r\nin the distance, and by a faint gleam of torches to attract their eyes\r\nto the remote Wartburg. Moreover, there was a lack of precision and\r\nclearness in the appearance of the chorus of young pilgrims, whose duty\r\nit was to announce the miracle by their song alone. At that time I had\r\ngiven them no budding staves to carry, and had unfortunately spoiled\r\ntheir refrain by a tedious and unbroken monotony of accompaniment.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the curtain fell, I was under the impression, not so much\r\nfrom the behaviour of the audience, which was friendly, as from my own\r\ninward conviction, that the failure of this work was to be attributed\r\nto the immature and unsuitable material used in its production. My\r\ndepression was extreme, and a few friends who were present after the\r\npiece, among them my dear sister Clara and her husband, were equally\r\naffected. That very evening I decided to remedy the defects of the\r\nfirst night before the second performance. I was conscious of where the\r\nprincipal fault lay, but hardly dared give expression to my conviction.\r\nAt the slightest attempt on my part to explain anything to Tichatschek\r\nI had to abandon it, as I realised the impossibility of success, I\r\nshould only have made him so embarrassed and annoyed, that on one\r\npretext or another he would never have sung Tannhäuser again. In order\r\nto ensure the repetition of my opera, therefore, I took the only course\r\nopen to me by arrogating to myself all blame for the failure. I could\r\nthus make considerable curtailments, whereby, of course, the dramatic\r\nsignificance of the leading role was considerably lessened; this,\r\nhowever, did not interfere with the other parts of the opera, which had\r\nbeen favourably received. Consequently, although inwardly very\r\nhumiliated, I hoped to gain some advantage for my work at the second\r\nperformance, and was particularly desirous that this should take place\r\nwith as little delay as possible. But Tichatschek was hoarse, and I had\r\nto possess my soul in patience for fully a week.\r\n\r\nI can hardly describe what I suffered during that time; it seemed as if\r\nthis delay would completely ruin my work. Every day that elapsed\r\nbetween the first and second performance left the result of the former\r\nmore and more problematic, until at last it appeared to be a generally\r\nacknowledged failure. While the public as a whole expressed angry\r\nastonishment that, after the approval they had shown of my Rienzi, I\r\nhad paid no attention to their taste in writing my new work, there were\r\nmay kind and judicious friends who were utterly perplexed at its\r\ninefficiency, the principal parts of which they had been unable to\r\nunderstand, or thought were imperfectly sketched and finished. The\r\ncritics, with unconcealed joy, attacked it as ravens attack carrion\r\nthrown out to them. Even the passions and prejudices of the day were\r\ndrawn into the controversy in order, if possible, to confuse men’s\r\nminds, and prejudice them against me. It was just at the time when the\r\nGerman-Catholic agitation, set in motion by Czersky and Ronge as a\r\nhighly meritorious and liberal movement, was causing a great commotion.\r\nIt was now made out that by Tannhäuser I had provoked a reactionary\r\ntendency, and that precisely as Meyerbeer with his Huguenots had\r\nglorified Protestantism, so I with my latest opera would glorify\r\nCatholicism.\r\n\r\nThe rumour that in writing Tannhäuser I had been bribed by the Catholic\r\npart was believed for a long time. While the effort was being made to\r\nruin my popularity by this means, I had the questionable honour of\r\nbeing approached, first by letter, afterwards in person, by a certain\r\nM. Rousseau, at that time editor of the Prussian Staatszeitung, who\r\nwished for my friendship and help. I knew of him only in connection\r\nwith a scathing criticism of my Fliegender Holländer. He informed me\r\nthat he had been sent from Austria to further the Catholic cause in\r\nBerlin, but that he had had so many sad experiences of the\r\nfruitlessness of his efforts, that he was now returning to Vienna to\r\ncontinue his work in this direction undisturbed, with which work I had,\r\nby my Tannhäuser, proclaimed myself fully in accord.\r\n\r\nThat remarkable paper, the Dresdener Anzeiger, which was a local organ\r\nfor the redress of slander and scandal, daily published some fresh bit\r\nof news to my prejudice. At last I noticed that these attacks were met\r\nby witty and forcible little snubs, and also that encouraging comments\r\nappeared in my favour, which for some time surprised me very much, as I\r\nknew that only enemies and never friends interested themselves in such\r\ncases. But I learned, to my amusement, from Röckel, that he and my\r\nfriend Heine had carried out this inspiriting campaign on my behalf.\r\n\r\nThe ill-feeling against me in this quarter was only troublesome because\r\nat that unfortunate period I was hindered from expressing myself\r\nthrough my work. Tichatschek continued hoarse, and it was said he would\r\nnever sing in my opera again. I heard from Lüttichau that, scared by\r\nthe failure of Tannhäuser, he was holding himself in readiness to\r\ncountermand the order for the promised scenery for the Hall of Song, or\r\nto cancel it altogether. I was so terrified at the cowardice which was\r\nthus revealed, that I myself began to look upon Tannhäuser as doomed.\r\nMy prospects and my whole position, when viewed in this mood, may be\r\nreadily gathered from my communications, especially those referring to\r\nmy negotiations for the publication of my works.\r\n\r\nThis terrible week dragged out like an endless eternity. I was afraid\r\nto look anybody in the face, but was one day obliged to go to Meser’s\r\nmusic shop, where I met Gottfried Semper just buying a text-book of\r\nTannhäuser. Only a short time before I had been very much put out in\r\ndiscussing this subject with him; he would listen to nothing I had to\r\nsay about the Minnesangers and Pilgrims of the Middle Ages in\r\nconnection with art, but gave me to understand that he despised me for\r\nmy choice of such material.\r\n\r\nWhile Meser assured me that no inquiry whatever had been received for\r\nthe numbers of Tannhäuser already published, it was strange that my\r\nmost energetic antagonist should be the only person who had actually\r\nbought and paid for a copy. In a peculiarly earnest and impressive\r\nmanner he remarked to me that it was necessary to be thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the subject if a just opinion was to be passed on it,\r\nand that for this purpose, unfortunately, nothing but the text was\r\navailable. This very meeting with Semper, strange as it may appear, was\r\nthe first really encouraging sign that I can remember.\r\n\r\nBut I found my greatest consolation in those days of trouble and\r\nanxiety in Röckel, who from that time forward entered into a lifelong\r\nintimacy with me. He had, without my being aware of it, disputed,\r\nexplained, quarrelled, and petitioned on my behalf, and thereby roused\r\nhimself to a veritable enthusiasm for Tannhäuser. The evening before\r\nthe second performance, which was at last to take place, we met over a\r\nglass of beer, and his bright demeanour had such a cheering effect upon\r\nme that we became very lively. After contemplating my head for some\r\ntime, he swore that it was impossible to destroy me, that there was a\r\nsomething in me, something, probably, in my blood, as similar\r\ncharacteristics also appeared in my brother Albert, who was otherwise\r\nso unlike me. To speak more plainly, he called it the peculiar HEAT of\r\nmy temperament; this heat, he thought, might consume others, whereas I\r\nappeared to feel at my best when it glowed most fiercely, for he had\r\nseveral times seen me positively ablaze. I laughed, and did not know\r\nwhat to make of his nonsense. Well, he said, I should soon see what he\r\nmeant in Tannhäuser, for it was simply absurd to think the work would\r\nnot live; and he was absolutely certain of its success. I thought over\r\nthe matter on my way home, and came to the conclusion that if\r\nTannhäuser did indeed win its way, and become really popular,\r\nincalculable possibilities might be attained.\r\n\r\nAt last the time arrived for our second performance. For this I thought\r\nI had made due preparation by lessening the importance of the principal\r\npart, and lowering my original ideals about some of the more important\r\nportions, and I hoped by accentuating certain undoubtedly attractive\r\npassages to secure a genuine appreciation of the whole. I was greatly\r\ndelighted with the scenery which had at last arrived for the Hall of\r\nSong in the second act, the beautiful and imposing effect of which\r\ncheered us all, for we looked upon it as a good omen. Unfortunately I\r\nhad to bear the humiliation of seeing the theatre nearly empty. This,\r\nmore than anything else, sufficed to convince me what the opinion of\r\nthe public really was in regard to my work. But, if the audience was\r\nscanty, the majority, at any rate, consisted of the first friends of my\r\nart, and the reception of the piece was very cordial. Mitterwurzer\r\nespecially aroused the greatest enthusiasm. As for Tichatschek, my\r\nanxious friends, Röckel and Heine, thought it necessary to endeavour by\r\nevery artifice to keep him in a good humour for his part. In order to\r\ngive practical assistance in making the undoubted obscurity of the last\r\nscene clear, my friends had asked several young people, more especially\r\nartists, to give vent to torrents of applause at those parts which are\r\nnot generally regarded by the opera-going public as provoking any\r\ndemonstration. Strange to say, the outburst of applause thus provoked\r\nafter the words, ‘An angel flies to God’s throne for thee, and will\r\nmake his voice heard; Heinrich, thou art saved,’ made the entire\r\nsituation suddenly clear to the public. At all subsequent productions\r\nthis continued to be the principal moment for the expression of\r\nsympathy on the part of the audience, although it had passed quite\r\nunnoticed on the first night. A few days later a third performance took\r\nplace, but this time before a full house, Schroder-Devrient, depressed\r\nat the small share she was able to take in the success of my work,\r\nwatched the progress of the opera from the small stage box; she\r\ninformed me that Lüttichau had come to her with a beaming face, saying\r\nhe thought we had now carried Tannhäuser happily through.\r\n\r\nAnd this certainly proved to be the case; we often repeated it in the\r\ncourse of the winter, but noticed that when two performances followed\r\nclose upon one another, there was not such a rush for the second, from\r\nwhich we concluded that I had not yet gained the approval of the great\r\nopera-going public, but only of the more cultured section of the\r\ncommunity. Among these real friends of Tannhäuser there were many, as I\r\ngradually discovered, who as a rule never visited the theatre at all,\r\nand least of all the opera. This interest on the part of a totally new\r\npublic continued to grow in intensity, and expressed itself in a\r\ndelightful and hitherto unknown manner by a strong sympathy for the\r\nauthor. It was particularly painful to me, on Tichatschek’s account, to\r\nrespond alone to the calls of the audience after almost every act;\r\nhowever, I had at last to submit, as my refusal would only have exposed\r\nthe vocalist to fresh humiliations, for when he appeared on the stage\r\nwith his colleagues without me, the loud shouts for me were almost\r\ninsulting to him. With what genuine eagerness did I wish that the\r\ncontrary were the case, and that the excellence of the execution might\r\novershadow the author. The conviction that I should never attain this\r\nwith my Tannhäuser in Dresden guided me in all my future undertakings.\r\nBut, at all events, in producing Tannhäuser in this city I had\r\nsucceeded in making at least the cultured public acquainted with my\r\npeculiar tendencies, by stimulating their mental faculties and\r\nstripping the performance of all realistic accessories. I did not,\r\nhowever, succeed in making these tendencies sufficiently clear in a\r\ndramatic performance, and in such an irresistible and convincing manner\r\nas also to familiarise the uncultivated taste of the ordinary public\r\nwith them when they saw them embodied on the stage.\r\n\r\nBy enlarging the circle of my acquaintances, and making interesting\r\nfriends, I had a good opportunity during the winter of obtaining\r\nfurther information on this point in a way that was both instructive\r\nand encouraging. My acquaintance and close intimacy at this time with\r\nDr. Hermann Franck of Breslau, who had for some time been living\r\nquietly in Dresden, was also very inspiring. He was very comfortably\r\noff, and was one of those men who, by a wide knowledge and good\r\njudgment, combined with considerable gifts as an author, won an\r\nexcellent reputation for himself in a large and select circle of\r\nprivate friends, without, however, making any great name for himself\r\nwith the public. He endeavoured to use his knowledge and abilities for\r\nthe general good, and was induced by Brockhaus to edit the Deutsche\r\nAllgemeine Zeitung when it first started. This paper had been founded\r\nby Brockhaus some years earlier. However, after editing it for a year,\r\nFranck resigned this post, and from that time forward it was only on\r\nthe very rarest occasions that he could be persuaded to touch anything\r\nconnected with journalism. His curt and spirited remarks about his\r\nexperiences in connection with the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung\r\njustified his disinclination to engage in any work connected with the\r\npublic press. My appreciation was all the greater, therefore, when,\r\nwithout any persuasion on my part, he wrote a full report on Tannhäuser\r\nfor the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung. This appeared in October or\r\nNovember, 1845, in a supplement to that paper, and although it\r\ncontained the first account of a work which has since been so widely\r\ndiscussed, I regard it, after mature consideration, as the most\r\nfar-reaching and exhaustive that has ever been written. By this means\r\nmy name figured for the first time in the great European political\r\npaper, whose columns, in consequence of a remarkable change of front\r\nwhich was to the interests of the proprietors, have since been open to\r\nany one who wished to make merry at the expense of me or my work.\r\n\r\nThe point which particularly attracted me in Dr. Franck was the\r\ndelicate and tactful art he displayed in his criticism and his methods\r\nof discussion. There was something distinguished about them that was\r\nnot so much the outcome of rank and social position as of genuine\r\nworld-wide culture.\r\n\r\nThe delicate coldness and reserve of his manner charmed rather than\r\nrepelled me, as it was a characteristic I had not met with hitherto.\r\nWhen I found him expressing himself with some reserve in regard to\r\npersons who enjoyed a reputation to which I did not think they were\r\nalways entitled, I was very pleased to see during my intercourse with\r\nhim that in many ways I exercised a decisive influence over his\r\nopinion. Even at that time I did not care to let it pass unchallenged\r\nwhen people evaded the close analysis of the work of this or that\r\ncelebrity, by referring in terms of eulogy to his ‘good-nature.’ I even\r\ncornered my worldly wise friend on this point, when a few years later I\r\nhad the satisfaction of getting from him a very concise explanation of\r\nMeyerbeer’s ‘good-nature,’ of which he had once spoken, and he recalled\r\nwith a smile the extraordinary questions I had put to him at the time.\r\nHe was, however, quite alarmed when I gave him a very lucid explanation\r\nof the disinterestedness and conspicuous altruism of Mendelssohn in the\r\nservice of art, of which he had spoken enthusiastically. In a\r\nconversation about Mendelssohn he had remarked how delightful it was to\r\nfind a man able to make real sacrifices in order to free himself from a\r\nfalse position that was of no service to art. It was assuredly a grand\r\nthing, he said, to have renounced a good salary of nine thousand marks\r\nas general musical conductor in Berlin, and to have retired to Leipzig\r\nas a simple conductor at the Gewandhaus concerts, and Mendelssohn was\r\nmuch to be admired on that account. Just at that time I happened to be\r\nin a position to give some correct details regarding this apparent\r\nsacrifice on the part of Mendelssohn, because when I had made a serious\r\nproposal to our general management about increasing the salaries of\r\nseveral of the poorer members of the orchestra, Lüttichau was requested\r\nto inform me that, according to the King’s latest commands, the\r\nexpenditure on the state bands was to be so restricted that for the\r\npresent the poorer chamber musicians could not claim any consideration,\r\nfor Herr von Falkenstein, the governor of the Leipzig district, who was\r\na passionate admirer of Mendelssohn’s, had gone so far as to influence\r\nthe King to appoint the latter secret conductor, with a secret salary\r\nof six thousand marks. This sum, together with the salary of three\r\nthousand marks openly granted him by the management of the Leipzig\r\nGewandhaus, would amply compensate him for the position he had\r\nrenounced in Berlin, and he had consequently consented to migrate to\r\nLeipzig. This large grant had, for decency’s sake, to be kept secret by\r\nthe board administering the band funds, not only because it was\r\ndetrimental to the interests of the institution, but also because it\r\nmight give offence to those who were acting as conductors at a lower\r\nsalary, if they knew another man had been appointed to a sinecure. From\r\nthese circumstances Mendelssohn derived not only the advantage of\r\nhaving the grant kept a secret, but also the satisfaction of allowing\r\nhis friends to applaud him as a model of self-sacrificing zeal for\r\ngoing to Leipzig; which they could easily do, although they knew him to\r\nbe in a good financial position. When I explained this to Franck, he\r\nwas astonished, and admitted it was one of the strangest cases he had\r\never come across in connection with undeserved fame.\r\n\r\nWe soon arrived at a mutual understanding in our views about many other\r\nartistic celebrities with whom we came in contact at that time in\r\nDresden. This was a simple matter in the case of Ferdinand Hiller, who\r\nwas regarded as the chief of the ‘good-natured’ ones. Regarding the\r\nmore famous painters of the so-called Dusseldorf School, whom I met\r\nfrequently through the medium of Tannhäuser, it was not quite so easy\r\nto come to a conclusion, as I was to a great extent influenced by the\r\nfame attached to their well-known names; but here again Franck startled\r\nme with opportune and conclusive reasons for disappointment. When it\r\nwas a question between Bendemann and Hubner, it seemed to me that\r\nHubner might very well be sacrificed to Bendemann. The latter, who had\r\nonly just completed the frescoes for one of the reception-rooms at the\r\nroyal palace, and had been rewarded by his friends with a banquet,\r\nappeared to me to have the right to be honoured as a great master. I\r\nwas very much astonished, therefore, when Franck calmly pitied the King\r\nof Saxony for having had his room ‘bedaubed’ by Bendemann!\r\nNevertheless, there was no denying that these people were\r\n‘good-natured.’ My intercourse with them became more frequent, and at\r\nall events offered me opportunities of mixing with the more cultured\r\nartistic society, in distinction to the theatrical circles with which I\r\nhad usually associated; yet I never derived from it the least\r\nenthusiasm or inspiration. The latter, however, appears to have been\r\nHiller’s main object, and that winter he organised a sort of social\r\ncircle which held weekly meetings at the home of one or the other of\r\nits members in turn. Reinecke, who was both painter and poet, joined\r\nthis society, together with Hubner and Bendemann, and had the bad\r\nfortune to write the new text for an opera for Hiller, the fate of\r\nwhich I will describe later on. Robert Schumann, the musician, who was\r\nalso in Dresden at this time, and was busy working out on opera, which\r\neventually developed into Genovefa, made advances to Hiller and myself.\r\nI had already known Schumann in Leipzig, and we had both entered upon\r\nour musical careers at about the same time. I had also occasionally\r\nsent small contributions to the Neue Zeitschrift fur Musik, of which he\r\nhad formerly been editor, and more recently a longer one from Paris on\r\nRossini’s Stabat Mater. He had been asked to conduct his Paradies und\r\nPeri at a concert to be given at the theatre; but his peculiar\r\nawkwardness in conducting on that occasion aroused my sympathy for the\r\nconscientious and energetic musician whose work made so strong an\r\nappeal to me, and a kindly and friendly confidence soon grew up between\r\nus. After a performance of Tannhäuser, at which he was present, he\r\ncalled on me one morning and declared himself fully and decidedly in\r\nfavour of my work. The only objection he had to make was that the\r\nstretta of the second finale was too abrupt, a criticism which proved\r\nhis keenness of perception; and I was able to show him, by the score,\r\nhow I had been compelled, much against my inclination, to curtail the\r\nopera, and thereby create the position to which he had taken exception.\r\nWe often met when out walking and, as far as it was possible with a\r\nperson so sparing of words, we exchanged views on matters of musical\r\ninterest. He was looking forward to the production, under my baton, of\r\nBeethoven’s Ninth Symphony, as he had attended the performances at\r\nLeipzig, and had been very much disappointed by Mendelssohn’s\r\nconducting, which had quite misunderstood the time of the first\r\nmovement. Otherwise his society did not inspire me particularly, and\r\nthe fact that he was too conservative to benefit by my views was soon\r\nshown, more especially in his conception of the poem of Genovefa. It\r\nwas clear that my example had only made a very transient impression on\r\nhim, only just enough, in fact, to make him think it advisable to write\r\nthe text of an opera himself. He afterwards invited me to hear him read\r\nhis libretto, which was a combination of the styles of Hebbel and\r\nTieck. When, however, out of a genuine desire for the success of his\r\nwork, about which I had serious misgivings, I called his attention to\r\nsome grave defects in it, and suggested the necessary alterations, I\r\nrealised how matters stood with this extraordinary person: he simply\r\nwanted me to be swayed by himself, but deeply resented any interference\r\nwith the product of his own ideals, so that thenceforward I let matters\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIn the following winter, our circle, thanks to the assiduity of Hiller,\r\nwas considerably widened, and it now became a sort of club whose object\r\nwas to meet freely every week in a room at Engel’s restaurant at the\r\nPostplatz. Just about this time the famous J. Schnorr of Munich was\r\nappointed director of the museums in Dresden, and we entertained him at\r\na banquet. I had already seen some of his large and well-executed\r\ncartoons, which made a deep impression on me, not only on account of\r\ntheir dimensions, but also by reason of the events they depicted from\r\nold German history, in which I was at that time particularly\r\ninterested. It was through Schnorr that I now became acquainted with\r\nthe ‘Munich School’ of which he was the master. My heart overflowed\r\nwhen I thought what it meant for Dresden, if such giants of German art\r\nwere to shake hands there. I was much struck by Schnorr’s appearance\r\nand conversation, and I could not reconcile his whining pedagogic\r\nmanner with his mighty cartoons; however, I thought it a great stroke\r\nof luck when he also took to frequenting Engel’s restaurant on\r\nSaturdays. He was well versed in the old German legends, and I was\r\ndelighted when they formed the topic of conversation. The famous\r\nsculptor, Hänel, used also to attend these meetings, and his marvellous\r\ntalent inspired me with the greatest respect, although I was not an\r\nauthority on his work, and could only judge of it by my own feelings. I\r\nsoon saw that his bearing and manner were affected; he was very fond of\r\nexpressing his opinion and judgment on questions of art, and I was not\r\nin a position to decide whether they were reliable or otherwise. In\r\nfact, it often occurred to me that I was listening to a Philistine\r\nswaggerer. It was only when my old friend Pecht, who had also settled\r\nin Dresden for a time, clearly and emphatically explained to me Hänel’s\r\nstanding as an artist, that I conquered all my secret doubts, and tried\r\nto find some pleasure in his works. Rietschel, who was also a member of\r\nour society, was the very antithesis of Hänel. I often found it\r\ndifficult to believe that the pale delicate man, with the whining\r\nnervous way of expressing himself, was really a sculptor; but as\r\nsimilar peculiarities in Schnorr did not prevent me from recognising\r\nhim as a marvellous painter, this helped me to make friends with\r\nRietschel, as he was quite free from affectation, and had a warm\r\nsympathetic soul that drew me ever closer to him. I also remember\r\nhearing from him a very enthusiastic appreciation of my personality as\r\na conductor. In spite, however, of being fellow-members of our\r\nversatile art club, we never attained a footing of real comradeship,\r\nfor, after all, no one thought much of anybody else’s talents. For\r\ninstance, Hiller had arranged some orchestral concerts, and to\r\ncommemorate them he was entertained at the usual banquet by his\r\nfriends, when his services were gratefully acknowledged with due\r\nrhetorical pathos. Yet I never found, in my private intercourse with\r\nHiller’s friends, the least enthusiasm in regard to his work; on the\r\ncontrary, I only noticed expressions of doubt and apprehensive shrugs.\r\n\r\nThese feted concerts soon came to an end. At our social evenings we\r\nnever discussed the works of the masters who were present; they were\r\nnot even mentioned, and it was soon evident that none of the members\r\nknew what to talk about. Semper was the only man who, in his\r\nextraordinary fashion, often so enlivened our entertainments that\r\nRietschel, inwardly sympathetic, though painfully startled, would\r\nheartily complain against the unrestrained outbursts that led not\r\ninfrequently to hot discussions between Semper and myself. Strange to\r\nsay, we two always seemed to start from the hypothesis that we were\r\nantagonists, for he insisted upon regarding me as the representative of\r\nmediaeval Catholicism, which he often attacked with real fury. I\r\neventually succeeded in persuading him that my studies and inclinations\r\nhad always led me to German antiquity, and to the discovery of ideals\r\nin the early Teutonic myths. When we came to paganism, and I expressed\r\nmy enthusiasm for the genuine heathen legends, he became quite a\r\ndifferent being, and a deep and growing interest now began to unite us\r\nin such a way that it quite isolated us from the rest of the company.\r\nIt was, however, impossible ever to settle anything without a heated\r\nargument, not only because Semper had a peculiar habit of contradicting\r\neverything flatly, but also because he knew his views were opposed to\r\nthose of the entire company. His paradoxical assertions, which were\r\napparently only intended to stir up strife, soon made me realise,\r\nbeyond any doubt, that he was the only one present who was passionately\r\nin earnest about everything he said, whereas all the others were quite\r\ncontent to let the matter drop when convenient. A man of the latter\r\ntype was Gutzkow, who was often with us; he had been summoned to\r\nDresden by the general management of our court theatre, to act in the\r\ncapacity of dramatist and adapter of plays. Several of his pieces had\r\nrecently met with great success: Zopf und Schwert, Das Urbild des\r\nTartuffe, and Uriel Acosta, shed an unexpected lustre on the latest\r\ndramatic repertoire, and it seemed as though the advent of Gutzkow\r\nwould inaugurate a new era of glory for the Dresden theatre, where my\r\noperas had also been first produced. The good intentions of the\r\nmanagement were certainly undeniable. My only regret on that occasion\r\nwas that the hopes my old friend Laube entertained of being summoned to\r\nDresden to fill that post were unrealised. He also had thrown himself\r\nenthusiastically into the work of dramatic literature. Even in Paris I\r\nhad noticed the eagerness with which he used to study the technique of\r\ndramatic composition, especially that of Scribe, in the hope of\r\nacquiring the skill of that writer, without which, as he soon\r\ndiscovered, no poetical drama in German could be successful. He\r\nmaintained that he had thoroughly mastered this style in his comedy,\r\nRococo, and he cherished the conviction that he could work up any\r\nimaginable material into an effective stage play.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, he was very careful to show equal skill in the\r\nselection of his material. In my opinion this theory of his was a\r\ncomplete failure, as his only successful pieces were those in which\r\npopular interest was excited by catch-phrases. This interest was always\r\nmore or less associated with the politics of the day, and generally\r\ninvolved some obvious diatribes about ‘German unity’ and ‘German\r\nLiberalism.’ As this important stimulus was first applied by way of\r\nexperiment to the subscribers to our Residenz Theater, and afterwards\r\nto the German public generally, it had, as I have already said, to be\r\nworked out with the consummate skill which, presumably, could only be\r\nlearned from modern French writers of comic opera.\r\n\r\nI was very glad to see the result of this study in Laube’s plays, more\r\nespecially as when he visited us in Dresden, which he often did on the\r\noccasion of a new production, he admitted his indebtedness with modest\r\ncandour, and was far from pretending to be a real poet. Moreover, he\r\ndisplayed great skill and an almost fiery zeal, not only in the\r\npreparation of his pieces, but also in their production, so that the\r\noffer of a post at Dresden, the hope of which had been held out to him,\r\nwould at least, from a practical point of view, have been a benefit to\r\nthe theatre. Finally, however, the choice fell on his rival Gutzkow, in\r\nspite of his obvious unsuitability for the practical work of dramatist.\r\nIt was evident that even as regards his successful plays his triumph\r\nwas mainly due to his literary skill, because these effective plays\r\nwere immediately followed by wearisome productions which made us\r\nrealise, to our astonishment, that he himself could not have been aware\r\nof the skill he had previously displayed. It was, however, precisely\r\nthese abstract qualities of the genuine man of letters which, in the\r\neyes of many, cast over him the halo of literary greatness; and when\r\nLüttichau, thinking more of a showy reputation than of permanent\r\nbenefit to his theatre, decided to give the preference to Gutzkow, he\r\nthought his choice would give a special impetus to the cause of higher\r\nculture. To me the appointment of Gutzkow as the director of dramatic\r\nart at the theatre was peculiarly objectionable, as it was not long\r\nbefore I was convinced of his utter incompetence for the task, and it\r\nwas probably owing to the frankness with which I expressed my opinion\r\nto Lüttichau that our subsequent estrangement was originally due. I had\r\nto complain bitterly of the want of judgment and the levity of those\r\nwho so recklessly selected men to fill the posts of managers and\r\nconductors in such precious institutions of art as the German royal\r\ntheatres. To obviate the failure I felt convinced must follow on this\r\nimportant appointment, I made a special request that Gutzkow should not\r\nbe allowed to interfere in the management of the opera; he readily\r\nyielded, and thus spared himself great humiliation. This action,\r\nhowever, created a feeling of mistrust between us, though I was quite\r\nready to remove this as far as possible by coming into personal contact\r\nwith him whenever opportunity offered on those evenings when the\r\nartists used to gather at the club, as already described. I would\r\ngladly have made this strange man, whose head was anxiously bowed down\r\non his breast, relax and unburden himself in his conversations with me,\r\nbut I was unsuccessful, on account of his constant reserve and\r\nsuspicion, and his studied aloofness. An opportunity arose for a\r\ndiscussion between us when he wanted the orchestra to take a\r\nmelodramatic part (which they afterwards did) in a certain scene of his\r\nUriel Acosta, where the hero had to recant his alleged heresy. The\r\norchestra had to execute the soft tremolo for a given time on certain\r\nchords, but when I heard the performance it appeared to me absurd, and\r\nequally derogatory both for the music and the drama.\r\n\r\nOn one of these evenings I tried to come to an understanding with\r\nGutzkow concerning this, and the employment of music generally as a\r\nmelodramatic auxiliary to the drama, and I discussed my views on the\r\nsubject in accordance with the highest principles I had conceived. He\r\nmet all the chief points of my discussion with a nervous distrustful\r\nsilence, but finally explained that I really went too far in the\r\nsignificance which I claimed for music, and that he failed to\r\nunderstand how music would be degraded if it were applied more\r\nsparingly to the drama, seeing that the claims of verse were often\r\ntreated with much less respect when it was used as a mere accessory to\r\noperatic music. To put it practically, in fact, it would be advisable\r\nfor the librettist not to be too dainty in this matter; it wasn’t\r\npossible always to give the actor a brilliant exit; at the same time,\r\nhowever, nothing could be more painful than when the chief performer\r\nmade his exit without any applause. In such cases a little distracting\r\nnoise in the orchestra really supplied a happy diversion. This I\r\nactually heard Gutzkow say; moreover, I saw that he really meant it!\r\nAfter this I felt I had done with him.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before I had equally little to do with all the\r\npainters, musicians, and other zealots in art belonging to our society.\r\nAt the same time, however, I came into closer contact with Berthold\r\nAuerbach. With great enthusiasm, Alwine Frommann had already drawn my\r\nattention to Auerbach’s Pastoral Stories. The account she gave of these\r\nmodest works (for that is how she characterised them) sounded quite\r\nattractive. She said that they had had the same refreshing effect on\r\nher circle of friends in Berlin as that produced by opening the window\r\nof a scented boudoir (to which she compared the literature they had\r\nhitherto been used to), and letting in the fresh air of the woods.\r\nAfter that I read the Pastoral Stories of the Black Forest, which had\r\nso quickly become famous, and I, too, was strongly attracted by the\r\ncontents and tone of these realistic anecdotes about the life of the\r\npeople in a locality which it was easy enough to identify from the\r\nvivid descriptions. As at this time Dresden seemed to be becoming ever\r\nmore and more the rendezvous for the lights of our literary and\r\nartistic world, Auerbach also reconciled himself to taking up his\r\nquarters in this city; and for quite a long time, lived with his friend\r\nHiller, who thus again had a celebrity at his side of equal standing\r\nwith himself. The short, sturdy Jewish peasant boy, as he was placed to\r\nrepresent himself to be, made a very agreeable impression. It was only\r\nlater that I understood the significance of his green jacket, and above\r\nall of his green hunting-cap, which made him look exactly what the\r\nauthor of Swabian Pastoral Stories ought to look like, and this\r\nsignificance was anything but a naive one. The Swiss poet, Gottfried\r\nKeller, once told me that, when Auerbach was in Zürich, and he had\r\ndecided on taking him up, he (Auerbach) had drawn his attention to the\r\nbest way in which to introduce one’s literary effusions to the public,\r\nand to make money, and he advised him, above all things, to get a coat\r\nand cap like his own, for being, as he said, like himself, neither\r\nhandsome nor well grown, it would be far better deliberately to make\r\nhimself look rough and queer; so saying, he placed his cap on his head\r\nin such a way as to look a little rakish. For the time being, I\r\nperceived no real affectation in Auerbach; he had assimilated so much\r\nof the tone and ways of the people, and had done this so happily, that,\r\nin any case, one could not help asking oneself why, with these\r\ndelightful qualities, he should move with such tremendous ease in\r\nspheres that seemed absolutely antagonistic. At all events, he always\r\nseemed in his true element even in those circles which really seemed\r\nmost opposed to his assumed character; there he stood in his green\r\ncoat, keen, sensitive, and natural, surrounded by the distinguished\r\nsociety that flattered him; and he loved to show letters he had\r\nreceived from the Grand Duke of Weimar and his answers to them, all the\r\ntime looking at things from the standpoint of the Swabian peasant\r\nnature which suited him so admirably.\r\n\r\nWhat especially attracted me to him was the fact that he was the first\r\nJew I ever met with whom one could discuss Judaism with absolute\r\nfreedom. He even seemed particularly desirous of removing, in his\r\nagreeable manner, all prejudice on this score; and it was really\r\ntouching to hear him speak of his boyhood, and declare that he was\r\nperhaps the only German who had read Klopstock’s Messiah all through.\r\nHaving one day become absorbed in this work, which he read secretly in\r\nhis cottage home, he had played the truant from school, and when he\r\nfinally arrived too late at the school-house, his teacher angrily\r\nexclaimed: ‘You confounded Jew-boy, where have you been? Lending money\r\nagain?’ Such experiences had only made him feel pensive and melancholy,\r\nbut not bitter, and he had even been inspired with real compassion for\r\nthe coarseness of his tormentors. These were traits in his character\r\nwhich drew me very strongly to him. As time went on, however, it seemed\r\nto me a serious matter that he could not get away from the atmosphere\r\nof these ideas, for I began to feel that the universe contained no\r\nother problem for him than the elucidation of the Jewish question. One\r\nday, therefore, I protested as good-naturedly and confidentially as I\r\ncould, and advised him to let the whole problem of Judaism drop, as\r\nthere were, after all, many other standpoints from which the world\r\nmight be criticised. Strange to say, he thereupon not only lost his\r\ningeniousness, but also fell to whining in an ecstatic fashion, which\r\ndid not seem to me very genuine, and assured me that that would be an\r\nimpossibility for him, as there was still so much in Judaism which\r\nneeded his whole sympathy. I could not help recalling the surprising\r\nanguish which he had manifested on this occasion, when I learned, in\r\nthe course of time, that he had repeatedly arranged Jewish marriages,\r\nconcerning the happy result of which I heard nothing, save that he had,\r\nby this means, made quite a fortune. When, several years afterwards, I\r\nagain saw him in Zürich, I observed that his appearance had\r\nunfortunately changed in a manner quite disconcerting: he looked really\r\nextraordinarily common and dirty; his former refreshing liveliness had\r\nturned into the usual Jewish restlessness, and it was easy to see that\r\nall he said was uttered as if he regretted that his words could not be\r\nturned to better account in a newspaper article.\r\n\r\nDuring his time in Dresden, however, Auerbach’s warm agreement with my\r\nartistic projects really did me good, even though it may have been only\r\nfrom his Semitic and Swabian standpoint; so did the novelty of the\r\nexperience I was at that time undergoing as an artist, in meeting with\r\never-increasing regard and recognition among people of note, of\r\nacknowledged importance and of exceptional culture. If, after the\r\nsuccess obtained by Rienzi, I still remained with the circle of the\r\nreal theatrical world, the greater success following on Tannhäuser\r\ncertainly brought me into contact with such people as I have mentioned\r\nabove, who, though to be sure they considerably enlarged my ideas, at\r\nthe same time impressed me very unfavourably with what was apparently\r\nthe pinnacle of the artistic life of the period. At any rate, I felt\r\nneither rewarded nor, fortunately, even diverted by the acquaintances I\r\nwon by the first performance of my Tannhäuser that winter. On the\r\ncontrary, I felt an irresistible desire to withdraw into my shell and\r\nleave these gay surroundings into which, strangely enough, I had been\r\nintroduced at the instigation of Hiller, whom I soon recognised as\r\nbeing a nonentity. I felt I must quickly compose something, as this was\r\nthe only means of ridding myself of all the disturbing and painful\r\nexcitement Tannhäuser had produced in me.\r\n\r\nOnly a few weeks after the first performances I had worked out the\r\nwhole of the Lohengrin text. In November I had already read this poem\r\nto my intimate friends, and soon afterwards to the Hiller set. It was\r\npraised, and pronounced ‘effective.’ Schumann also thoroughly approved\r\nof it, although he did not understand the musical form in which I\r\nwished to carry it out, as he saw no resemblance in it to the old\r\nmethods of writing individual solos for the various artists. I then had\r\nsome fun in reading different parts of my work to him in the form of\r\narias and cavatinas, after which he laughingly declared himself\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nSerious reflection, however, aroused my gravest doubts as to the tragic\r\ncharacter of the material itself, and to these doubts I had been led,\r\nin a manner both sensible and tactful, by Franck. He thought it\r\noffensive to effect Elsa’s punishment through Lohengrin’s departure;\r\nfor although he understood that the characteristics of the legend were\r\nexpressed precisely by this highly poetical feature, he was doubtful as\r\nto whether it did full justice to the demands of tragic feeling in its\r\nrelation to dramatic realism. He would have preferred to see Lohengrin\r\ndie before our eyes owing to Elsa’s loving treachery. As, however, this\r\ndid not seem feasible, he would have liked to see Lohengrin spell-bound\r\nby some powerful motive, and prevented from getting away. Although, of\r\ncourse, I would not agree to any of these suggestions, I went so far as\r\nto consider whether I could not do away with the cruel separation, and\r\nstill retain the incident of Lohengrin’s departure, which was\r\nessential. I then sought for a means of letting Elsa go away with\r\nLohengrin, as a form of penance which would withdraw her also from the\r\nworld. This seemed more promising to my talented friend. While I was\r\nstill very doubtful about all this, I gave my poem to Frau von\r\nLüttichau, so that she might peruse it, and criticise the point raised\r\nby Franck. In a little letter, in which she expressed her pleasure at\r\nmy poem, she wrote briefly, but very decidedly, on the knotty question,\r\nand declared that Franck must be devoid of all poetry if he did not\r\nunderstand that it was exactly in the way I had chosen, and in no\r\nother, that Lohengrin must depart. I felt as if a load had fallen from\r\nmy heart. In triumph I showed the letter to Franck, who, much abashed,\r\nand by way of excusing himself, opened a correspondence with Frau von\r\nLüttichau, which certainly cannot have been lacking in interest, though\r\nI was never able to see any of it. In any case, the upshot of it was\r\nthat Lohengrin remained as I had originally conceived it. Curiously\r\nenough, some time later, I had a similar experience with regard to the\r\nsame subject, which again put me in a temporary state of uncertainty.\r\nWhen Adolf Stahr gravely raised the same objection to the solution of\r\nthe Lohengrin question, I was really taken aback by the uniformity of\r\nopinion; and as, owing to some excitement, I was just then no longer in\r\nthe same mood as when I composed Lohengrin, I was foolish enough to\r\nwrite a hurried letter to Stahr in which, with but a few slight\r\nreservations, I declared him to be right. I did not know that, by this,\r\nI was causing real grief to Liszt, who was now in the same position\r\nwith regard to Stahr as Frau von Lüttichau had been with regard to\r\nFranck. Fortunately, however, the displeasure of my great friend at my\r\nsupposed treachery to myself did not last long; for, without having got\r\nwind of the trouble I had caused him, and thanks to the torture I\r\nmyself was going through, I came to the proper decision in a few days,\r\nand, as clear as daylight, I saw what madness it had been. I was\r\ntherefore able to rejoice Liszt with the following laconical protest\r\nwhich I sent him from my Swiss resort: ‘Stahr is wrong, and Lohengrin\r\nis right.’\r\n\r\nFor the present I remained occupied with the revision of my poem, for\r\nthere could be no question of planning the music to it just now. That\r\npeaceful and harmonious state of mind which is so favourable to\r\ncreative work, and always so necessary to me for composing, I now had\r\nto secure with the greatest difficulty, for it was one of the things I\r\nalways had the hardest struggle to obtain. All the experiences\r\nconnected with the performance of Tannhäuser having filled me with true\r\ndespair as to the whole future of my artistic operations, I saw it was\r\nhopeless to think of its production being extended to other German\r\ntheatres—for I had not been able to achieve this end even with the\r\nsuccessful Rienzi. It was perfectly obvious, therefore, that my work\r\nwould, at the utmost, be conceded a permanent place in the Dresden\r\nrepertoire. As the result of all this, my pecuniary affairs, which have\r\nalready been described, had got into such a serious state that a\r\ncatastrophe seemed inevitable. While I was preparing to meet this in\r\nthe best way I could, I tried to stupefy myself, on the one hand, by\r\nplunging into the study of history, mythology, and literature, which\r\nwere becoming ever dearer and dearer to me, and on the other by working\r\nincessantly at my artistic enterprises. As regards the former, I was\r\nchiefly interested in the German Middle Ages, and tried to make myself\r\nfamiliar with every point relative to this period. Although I could not\r\nset about this task with philological precision, I proceeded with such\r\nearnestness that I studied the German records, published by Grimm, for\r\ninstance, with the greatest interest. As I could not put the results of\r\nsuch studies immediately into my scenes, there were many who could not\r\nunderstand why, as an operatic composer, I should waste my time on such\r\nbarren work. Different people remarked later on, that the personality\r\nof Lohengrin had a charm quite its own; but this was ascribed to the\r\nhappy selection of the subject, and I was specially praised for\r\nchoosing it. Material from the German Middle Ages, and later on,\r\nsubjects from Scandinavian antiquity, were therefore looked forward to\r\nby many, and, in the end, they were astonished that I gave them no\r\nadequate result of all my labours. Perhaps it will be of help to them\r\nif I now tell them to take the old records and such works to their aid.\r\nI forgot at that time to call Hiller’s attention to my documents, and\r\nwith great pride he seized upon a subject out of the history of the\r\nHohenstaufen. As, however, he had no success with his work, he may\r\nperhaps think I was a little artful for not having spoken to him of the\r\nold records.\r\n\r\nConcerning my other duties, my chief undertaking for this winter\r\nconsisted in an exceptionally carefully prepared performance of\r\nBeethoven’s Ninth Symphony, which took place in the spring on Palm\r\nSunday. This performance involved many a struggle, besides a host of\r\nexperiences which were destined to exercise a strong influence over my\r\nfurther development. Roughly they were as follows: the royal orchestra\r\nhad only one opportunity a year of showing their powers independently\r\nin a musical performance outside the Opera or the church. For the\r\nbenefit of the Pension Fund for their widows and orphans, the old\r\nso-called Opera House was given up to a big performance originally only\r\nintended for oratorios. Ultimately, in order to make it more\r\nattractive, a symphony was always added to the oratorio; and, as\r\nalready mentioned, I had performed on such occasions, once the Pastoral\r\nSymphony, and later Haydn’s Creation. The latter was a great joy to me,\r\nand it was on this occasion that I first made its acquaintance. As we\r\ntwo conductors had stipulated for alternate performances, the Symphony\r\non Palm Sunday of the year 1846 fell to my lot. I had a great longing\r\nfor the Ninth Symphony, and I was led to the choice of this work by the\r\nfact that it was almost unknown in Dresden. When the directors of the\r\norchestra, who were the trustees of the Pension Fund, and who had to\r\npromote its increase, got to know of this, such a fright seized them\r\nthat they interviewed the general director, Lüttichau, and begged him,\r\nby virtue of his high authority, to dissuade me from carrying out my\r\nintention. They gave as a reason for this request, that the Pension\r\nFund would surely suffer through the choice of this symphony, as the\r\nwork was in ill-repute in the place, and would certainly keep people\r\nfrom going to the concert. The symphony had been performed many years\r\nbefore by Reissiger at a charity concert, and, as the conductor himself\r\nhonestly admitted, had been an absolute failure. Now it needed my whole\r\nardour, and all the eloquence I could command, to prevail over the\r\ndoubts of our principal. With the orchestral directors, however, there\r\nwas nothing for me to do but quarrel, as I heard that they were\r\ncomplaining all over the town about my indiscretion. In order to add\r\nshame to their trouble, I made up my mind to prepare the public in such\r\na way for the performance, upon which I had resolved, and for the work\r\nitself, that at least the sensation caused would lead to a full hall\r\nand thus, in a very favourable manner, guarantee satisfactory returns,\r\nand contradict their belief that the fund was menaced. Thus the Ninth\r\nSymphony had, in every conceivable way, become for me a point of\r\nhonour, for the success of which I had to exercise all my powers to the\r\nutmost. The committee had misgivings regarding the outlay needed for\r\nprocuring the orchestral parts, so I borrowed them from the Leipzig\r\nConcert Society.\r\n\r\nImagine my feelings, however, on now seeing for the first time since my\r\nearliest boyhood the mysterious pages of this score, which I studied\r\nconscientiously! In those days the sight of these same pages had filled\r\nme with the most mystic reveries, and I had stayed up for nights\r\ntogether to copy them out. Just as at the time of my uncertainty in\r\nParis, on hearing the rehearsal of the first three movements performed\r\nby the incomparable orchestra of the Conservatoire, I had been carried\r\nback through years of error and doubt to be placed in marvellous touch\r\nwith my earliest days, while all my inmost aspirations had been\r\nfruitfully stimulated in a new direction, so now in the same way the\r\nmemory of that music was secretly awakened in me as I again saw before\r\nmy own eyes that which in those early days had likewise been only a\r\nmysterious vision. I had by this time experienced much which, in the\r\ndepths of my soul, drove me almost unconsciously to a process of\r\nsumming-up, to an almost despairing inquiry concerning my fate. What I\r\ndared not acknowledge to myself was the fact of the absolute insecurity\r\nof my existence both from the artistic and financial point of view; for\r\nI saw that I was a stranger to my own mode of life as well as to my\r\nprofession, and I had no prospects whatsoever. This despair, which I\r\ntried to conceal from my friends, was now converted into genuine\r\nexaltation, thanks entirely to the Ninth Symphony. It is not likely\r\nthat the heart of a disciple has ever been filled with such keen\r\nrapture over the work of a master, as mine was at the first movement of\r\nthis symphony. If any one had come upon me unexpectedly while I had the\r\nopen score before me, and had seen me convulsed with sobs and tears as\r\nI went through the work in order to consider the best manner of\r\nrendering it, he would certainly have asked with astonishment if this\r\nwere really fitting behaviour for the Conductor Royal of Saxony!\r\nFortunately, on such occasions I was spared the visits of our orchestra\r\ndirectors, and their worthy conductor Reissiger, and even those of F.\r\nHiller, who was so versed in classical music.\r\n\r\nIn the first place I drew up a programme, for which the book of words\r\nfor the chorus—always ordered according to custom—furnished me with a\r\ngood pretext. I did this in order to provide a guide to the simple\r\nunderstanding of the work, and thereby hoped to appeal not to the\r\ncritical judgment, but solely to the feelings, of the audience. This\r\nprogramme, in the framing of which some of the chief passages in\r\nGoethe’s Faust were exceedingly helpful to me, was very well received,\r\nnot only on that occasion in Dresden, but later on in other places.\r\nBesides this, I made use of the Dresden Anzeiger, by writing all kinds\r\nof short and enthusiastic anonymous paragraphs, in order to whet the\r\npublic taste for a work which hitherto had been in ill-repute in\r\nDresden.\r\n\r\nNot only did these purely extraneous exertions succeed in making the\r\nreceipts of that year by far exceed any that had been taken\r\ntheretofore, but the orchestra directors themselves, during the\r\nremaining years of my stay in Dresden, made a point of ensuring\r\nsimilarly large profits by repeated performances of the celebrated\r\nsymphony. Concerning the artistic side of the performance, I aimed at\r\nmaking the orchestra give as expressive a rendering as possible, and to\r\nthis end made all kinds of notes, myself, in the various parts, so as\r\nto make quite sure that their interpretation would be as clear and as\r\ncoloured as could be desired. It was principally the custom which\r\nexisted then of doubling the wind instruments, that led me to a most\r\ncareful consideration of the advantages this system presented, for, in\r\nperformances on a large scale, the following somewhat crude rule\r\nprevailed: all those passages marked piano were executed by a single\r\nset of instruments, while those marked forte were carried out by a\r\nduplicated set. As an instance of the way in which I took care to\r\nensure an intelligible rendering by this means, I might point to a\r\ncertain passage in the second movement of the symphony, where the whole\r\nof the string instruments play the principal and rhythmical figure in C\r\nmajor for the first time; it is written in triple octaves, which play\r\nuninterruptedly in unison and, to a certain degree, serve as an\r\naccompaniment to the second theme, which is only performed by feeble\r\nwood instruments. As fortissimo is indicated alike for the whole\r\norchestra, the result in every imaginable rendering must be that the\r\nmelody for the wood instruments not only completely disappears, but\r\ncannot even be heard through the strings, which, after all, are only\r\naccompanying. Now, as I never carried my piety to the extent of taking\r\ndirections absolutely literally, rather than sacrifice the effect\r\nreally intended by the master to the erroneous indications given, I\r\nmade the strings play only moderately loudly instead of real\r\nfortissimo, up to the point where they alternate with the wind\r\ninstruments in taking up the continuation of the new theme: thus the\r\nmotive, rendered as it was as loudly as possible by a double set of\r\nwind instruments, was, I believe for the first time since the existence\r\nof the symphony, heard with real distinctness. I proceeded in this\r\nmanner throughout, in order to guarantee the greatest exactitude in the\r\ndynamical effects of the orchestra. There was nothing, however\r\ndifficult, which was allowed to be performed in such a way as not to\r\narouse the feelings of the audience in a particular manner. For\r\nexample, many brains had been puzzled by the Fugato in 6/8 time which\r\ncomes after the chorus, Froh wie seine Sonnen fliegen, in the movement\r\nof the finale marked alia marcia. In view of the preceding inspiriting\r\nverses, which seemed to be preparing for combat and victory, I\r\nconceived this Fugato really as a glad but earnest war-song, and I took\r\nit at a continuously fiery tempo, and with the utmost vigour. The day\r\nfollowing the first performance I had the satisfaction of receiving a\r\nvisit from the musical director Anacker of Freiburg, who came to tell\r\nme somewhat penitently, that though until then he had been one of my\r\nantagonists, since the performance of the symphony he certainly\r\nreckoned himself among my friends. What had absolutely overwhelmed him,\r\nhe said, was precisely my conception and interpretation of the Fugato.\r\nFurthermore, I devoted special attention to that extraordinary passage,\r\nresembling a recitative for the ‘cellos and basses, which comes at the\r\nbeginning of the last movement, and which had once caused my old friend\r\nPohlenz such great humiliation in Leipzig. Thanks to the exceptional\r\nexcellence of our bass players, I felt certain of attaining to absolute\r\nperfection in this passage. After twelve special rehearsals of the\r\ninstruments alone concerned, I succeeded in getting them to perform in\r\na way which sounded not only perfectly free, but which also expressed\r\nthe most exquisite tenderness and the greatest energy in a thoroughly\r\nimpressive manner.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of my undertaking I had at once recognised,\r\nthat the only method of achieving overwhelming popular success with\r\nthis symphony was to overcome, by some ideal means, the extraordinary\r\ndifficulties presented by the choral parts. I realised that the demands\r\nmade by these parts could be met only by a large and enthusiastic body\r\nof singers. It was above all necessary, then, to secure a very good and\r\nlarge choir; so, besides adding the somewhat feeble Dreissig ‘Academy\r\nof Singing’ to our usual number of members in the theatre chorus, in\r\nspite of great difficulties I also enlisted the help of the choir from\r\nthe Kreuzschule, with its fine boys’ voices, and the choir of the\r\nDresden seminary, which had had much practice in church singing. In a\r\nway quite my own I now tried to get these three hundred singers, who\r\nwere frequently united for rehearsals, into a state of genuine ecstasy;\r\nfor instance, I succeeded in demonstrating to the basses that the\r\ncelebrated passage Seid umschlungen, Millionen, and especially Bruder,\r\nuber’m Sternenzelt muss ein guter Vater wohnen, could not be sung in an\r\nordinary manner, but must, as it were, be proclaimed with the greatest\r\nrapture. In this I took the lead in a manner so elated that I really\r\nthink I literally transported them to a world of emotion utterly\r\nstrange to them for a while; and I did not desist till my voice, which\r\nhad been heard clearly above all the others, began to be no longer\r\ndistinguishable even to myself, but was drowned, so to speak, in the\r\nwarm sea of sound.\r\n\r\nIt gave me particular pleasure, with Mitterwurzer’s cooperation, to\r\ngive a most overwhelmingly expressive rendering of the recitative for\r\nbaritone: Freunde, nicht diese Tone. In view of its exceptional\r\ndifficulties this passage might almost be considered impossible to\r\nperform, and yet he executed it in a way which showed what fruit our\r\nmutual interchange of ideas had borne. I also took care that, by means\r\nof the complete reconstruction of the hall, I should obtain good\r\nacoustic conditions for the orchestra, which I had arranged according\r\nto quite a new system of my own. As may be imagined, it was only with\r\nthe greatest difficulty that the money for this could be found;\r\nhowever, I did not give up, and owing to a totally new construction of\r\nthe platform, I was able to concentrate the whole of the orchestra\r\ntowards the centre, and surround it, in amphitheatre fashion, by the\r\nthrong of singers who were accommodated on seats very considerably\r\nraised. This was not only of great advantage to the powerful effect of\r\nthe choir, but it also gave great precision and energy to the finely\r\norganised orchestra in the purely symphonic movements.\r\n\r\nEven at the general rehearsal the hall was overcrowded. Reissiger was\r\nguilty of the incredible stupidity of working up the public mind\r\nagainst the symphony and drawing attention to Beethoven’s very\r\nregrettable error. Gade, on the other hand, who came to visit us from\r\nLeipzig, where he was then conducting the Gewandhaus Concerts, assured\r\nme after the general rehearsal, that he would willingly have paid\r\ndouble the price of his ticket in order to hear the recitative by the\r\nbasses once more; whilst Hiller considered that I had gone too far in\r\nmy modification of the tempo. What he meant by this I learned\r\nsubsequently when I heard him conducting intricate orchestral works;\r\nbut of this I shall have more to say later on.\r\n\r\nThere was no denying that the performance was, on the whole, a success;\r\nin fact, it exceeded all our expectations, and was particularly well\r\nreceived by the non-musical public. Among these I remember the\r\nphilologist Dr. Kochly, who came to me at the end of the evening and\r\nconfessed that it was the first time he had been able to follow a\r\nsymphonic work from beginning to end with intelligent interest. This\r\nexperience left me with a pleasant feeling of ability and power, and\r\nstrongly confirmed me in the belief, that if I only desired anything\r\nwith sufficient earnestness, I was able to achieve it with irresistible\r\nand overwhelming success. I now had to consider, however, what the\r\ndifficulties were, which hitherto had prevented a similarly happy\r\nproduction of my own new conceptions. Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, which\r\nwas still such a problem to so many, and had, at all events, never\r\nattained to popularity, I had been able to make a complete success;\r\nyet, as often as it was put on the stage, my Tannhäuser taught me that\r\nthe possibilities of its success had yet to be discovered. How was this\r\nto be done? This was and remained the secret question which influenced\r\nall my subsequent development.\r\n\r\nI dared not, however, indulge at that time in any meditation on this\r\npoint with the view of arriving at any particular results, for the real\r\nsignificance of my failure, of which I was inwardly convinced, stood\r\nabsolutely bare before me with all its terrifying lessons. Albeit, I\r\ncould no longer delay taking even the most disagreeable steps with the\r\nview of warding off the catastrophe which menaced my financial\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nI was led to this, thanks to the influence of a ridiculous omen. My\r\nagent, the purely nominal publisher of my three operas—Rienzi, the\r\nFliegender Holländer, and Tannhäuser—the eccentric court music\r\npublisher, C. F. Meser, invited me one day to the cafe known as the\r\n‘Verderber’ to discuss our money affairs. With great qualms we talked\r\nover the possible results of the Annual Easter Fair, and wondered\r\nwhether they would be tolerably good or altogether bad. I gave him\r\ncourage, and ordered a bottle of the best Haut-Sauterne. A venerable\r\nflask made its appearance; I filled the glasses, and we drank to the\r\ngood success of the Fair; when suddenly we both yelled as though we had\r\ngone mad, while, with horror, we tried to rid our mouths of the strong\r\nTarragon vinegar with which we had been served by mistake. ‘Heavens!’\r\ncried Meser, ‘nothing could be worse!’ ‘True enough,’ I answered, ‘no\r\ndoubt there is much that will turn to vinegar for us.’ My good-humour\r\nrevealed to me in a flash that I must try some other way of saving\r\nmyself than by means of the Easter Fair.\r\n\r\nNot only was it necessary to refund the capital which had been got\r\ntogether by dint of ever-increasing sacrifices, in order to defray the\r\nexpenses of the publication of my operas; but, owing to the fact that I\r\nhad been obliged ultimately to seek aid from the usurers, the rumour of\r\nmy debts had spread so far abroad, that even those friends who had\r\nhelped me at the time of my arrival in Dresden were seized with anxiety\r\non my account. At this time I met with a really sad experience at the\r\nhands of Madame Schroder-Devrient, who, as the result of her\r\nincomprehensible lack of discretion, did much to bring about my final\r\nundoing. When I first settled in Dresden, as I have already pointed\r\nout, she lent me three thousand marks, not only to help me to discharge\r\nmy debts, but also to allow me to contribute to the maintenance of my\r\nold friend Kietz in Paris. Jealousy of my niece Johanna, and suspicion\r\nthat I had made her (my niece) come to Dresden in order to make it\r\neasier for the general management to dispense with the services of the\r\ngreat artist, had awakened in this otherwise so noble-minded woman the\r\nusual feelings of animosity towards me, which are so often met with in\r\nthe theatrical profession. She had now given up her engagement; she\r\neven declared openly that I had been partly instrumental in obtaining\r\nher dismissal; and abandoning all friendly regard for me, whereby she\r\ndeeply wronged me in every respect, she placed the I.O.U. I had given\r\nher in the hands of an energetic lawyer, and without further ado this\r\nman sued me for the payment of the money. Thus I was forced to make a\r\nclean breast of everything to Lüttichau, and to beseech him to\r\nintervene for me, and if possible to obtain a royal advance that would\r\nenable me to clear my position, which was so seriously compromised.\r\n\r\nMy principal declared himself willing to support any request I might\r\nwish to address to the King on this matter. To this end I had to note\r\ndown the amount of my debts; but as I soon discovered that the\r\nnecessary sum could only be assigned to me as a loan from the Theatre\r\nPension Fund, at an interest of five per cent., and that I should\r\nmoreover have to secure the capital of the Pension Fund by a life\r\ninsurance policy, which would cost me annually three per cent, of the\r\ncapital borrowed, I was, for obvious reasons, tempted to leave out of\r\nmy petition all those of my debts which were not of a pressing nature,\r\nand for the payment of which I thought I could count on the receipts\r\nwhich I might finally expect from my publishing enterprises.\r\nNevertheless, the sacrifices I had to make in order to repay the help\r\noffered me increased to such an extent, that my salary of conductor, in\r\nitself very slender, promised to be materially diminished for some time\r\nto come. I was forced to make the most irksome efforts to gather\r\ntogether the necessary sum for the life insurance policy, and was\r\ntherefore obliged frequently to appeal to Leipzig. In addition to this,\r\nI had to overcome the most appalling doubts in regard both to my health\r\nand to the probable length of my life, concerning which I fancied I had\r\nheard all sorts of malicious apprehensions expressed by those who had\r\nobserved me but casually in the miserable condition which I was in at\r\nthat time. My friend Pusinelli, as a doctor who was very intimate with\r\nme, eventually managed to give such satisfactory information concerning\r\nthe state of my health, that I succeeded in insuring my life at the\r\nrate of three per cent.\r\n\r\nThe last of these painful journeys to Leipzig was, at all events, made\r\nunder pleasant circumstances owing to a kind invitation from the old\r\nMaestro Louis Spohr. I was particularly pleased over this, because to\r\nme it meant nothing less than an act of reconciliation. As a matter of\r\nfact, Spohr had written to me on one occasion, and had declared that,\r\nstimulated by the success of my Fliegender Holländer and his own\r\nenjoyment of it, he had once more decided to take up the career of a\r\ndramatic composer, which of recent years had brought him such scant\r\nsuccess. His last work was an opera—Die Kreuz-fahrer—which he had sent\r\nto the Dresden theatre in the course of the preceding year in the hope,\r\nas he himself assured me, that I would urge on its production. After\r\nasking this favour, he drew my attention to the fact that in this work\r\nhe had made an absolutely new departure from his earlier operas, and\r\nhad kept to the most precise rhythmically dramatic declamation, which\r\nhad certainly been made all the more easy for him by the ‘excellent\r\nsubject.’ Without being actually surprised, my horror was indeed great\r\nwhen, after studying not only the text, but also the score, I\r\ndiscovered that the old maestro had been absolutely mistaken in regard\r\nto the account he had given me of his work. The custom in force at that\r\ntime that the decision concerning the production of works should not,\r\nas a rule, rest with one of the conductors alone, did not tend to make\r\nme any less fearful of declaring myself emphatically in favour of this\r\nwork. In addition to this, it was Reissiger, who, as he had often\r\nboasted, was an old friend of Spohr’s, whose turn it was to select and\r\nproduce a new work. Unfortunately, as I learned later, the general\r\nmanagement had returned Spohr’s opera to its author in such a curt\r\nmanner as to offend him, and he complained bitterly of this to me.\r\nGenuinely concerned at this, I had evidently managed to calm and\r\nappease him, for the invitation mentioned above was clearly a friendly\r\nacknowledgment of my efforts. He wrote that it was very painful for him\r\nto have to touch at Dresden on his way to one of the watering-places;\r\nas, however, he had a real longing to make my acquaintance, he begged\r\nme to meet him in Leipzig, where he was going to stay for a few days.\r\n\r\nThis meeting with him did not leave me unimpressed. He was a tall,\r\nstately man, distinguished in appearance, and of a serious and calm\r\ntemperament. He gave me to understand, in a touching, almost apologetic\r\nmanner, that the essence of his education and of his aversion from the\r\nnew tendencies in music, had its origin in the first impressions he had\r\nreceived on hearing, as a very young boy, Mozart’s Magic Flute, a work\r\nwhich was quite new at that time, and which had a great influence on\r\nhis whole life. Regarding my libretto to Lohengrin, which I had left\r\nbehind for him to read, and the general impression which my personal\r\nacquaintance had made on him, he expressed himself with almost\r\nsurprising warmth to my brother-in-law, Hermann Brockhaus, at whose\r\nhouse we had been invited to dine, and where, during the meal, the\r\nconversation was most animated. Besides this, we had met at real\r\nmusical evenings at the conductor Hauptmann’s as well as at\r\nMendelssohn’s, on which occasion I heard the master take the violin in\r\none of his own quartettes. It was precisely in these circles that I was\r\nimpressed by the touching and venerable dignity of his absolutely calm\r\ndemeanour. Later on, I learned from witnesses—for whose testimony, be\r\nit said, I cannot vouch—that Tannhäuser, when it was performed at\r\nCassel, had caused him so much confusion and pain that he declared he\r\ncould no longer follow me, and feared that I must be on the wrong road.\r\n\r\nIn order to recover from all the hardships and cares I had gone\r\nthrough, I now managed to obtain a special favour from the management,\r\nin the form of a three months’ leave, in which to improve my health in\r\nrustic retirement, and to get pure air to breathe while composing some\r\nnew work. To this end I had chosen a peasant’s house in the village of\r\nGross-Graupen, which is half-way between Pillnitz and the border of\r\nwhat is known as ‘Saxon Switzerland.’ Frequent excursions to the\r\nPorsberg, to the adjacent Liebethaler, and to the far distant bastion\r\nhelped to strengthen my unstrung nerves. While I was first planning the\r\nmusic to Lohengrin, I was disturbed incessantly by the echoes of some\r\nof the airs in Rossini’s William Tell, which was the last opera I had\r\nhad to conduct. At last I happened to hit on an effective means of\r\nstopping this annoying obtrusion: during my lonely walks I sang with\r\ngreat emphasis the first theme from the Ninth Symphony, which had also\r\nquite lately been revived in my memory. This succeeded! At Pirna, where\r\none can bathe in the river, I was surprised, on one of my almost\r\nregular evening constitutionals, to hear the air from the Pilgrim’s\r\nChorus out of Tannhäuser whistled by some bather, who was invisible to\r\nme. This first sign of the possibility of popularising the work, which\r\nI had with such difficulty succeeded in getting performed in Dresden,\r\nmade an impression on me which no similar experience later on has ever\r\nbeen able to surpass. Sometimes I received visits from friends in\r\nDresden, and among them Hans von Bulow, who was then sixteen years old,\r\ncame accompanied by Lipinsky. This gave me great pleasure, because I\r\nhad already noticed the interest which he took in me. Generally,\r\nhowever, I had to rely only on my wife’s company, and during my long\r\nwalks I had to be satisfied with my little dog Peps. During this summer\r\nholiday, of which a great part of the time had at the beginning to be\r\ndevoted to the unpleasant task of arranging my business affairs, and\r\nalso to the improvement of my health, I nevertheless succeeded in\r\nmaking a sketch of the music to the whole of the three acts of\r\nLohengrin, although this cannot be said to have consisted of anything\r\nmore than a very hasty outline.\r\n\r\nWith this much gained, I returned in August to Dresden, and resumed my\r\nduties as conductor, which every year seemed to become more and more\r\nburdensome to me. Moreover, I immediately plunged once more into the\r\nmidst of troubles which had only just been temporarily allayed. The\r\nbusiness of publishing my operas, on the success of which I still\r\ncounted as the only means of liberating me from my difficult position,\r\ndemanded ever-fresh sacrifices if the enterprise were to be made worth\r\nwhile. But as my income was now very much reduced, even the smallest\r\noutlays necessarily led me into ever-new and more painful\r\ncomplications; and I once more lost all courage.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I tried to strengthen myself by again working\r\nenergetically at Lohengrin. While doing this, I proceeded in a manner\r\nthat I have not since repeated. I first of all completed the third act,\r\nand in view of the criticism already mentioned of the characters and\r\nconclusion of this act, I determined to try to make it the very pivot\r\nof the whole opera. I wished to do this, if only for the sake of the\r\nmusical motive appearing in the story of the Holy Grail; but in other\r\nrespects the plan struck me as perfectly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOwing to previous suggestions on my part, Gluck’s Iphigenia in Aulis\r\nwas to be produced this winter. I felt it my duty to give more care and\r\nattention to this work, which interested me particularly on account of\r\nits subject, than I had given to the study of the Armida. In the first\r\nplace, I was upset by the translation in which the opera with the\r\nBerlin score was presented to us. In order not to be led into false\r\ninterpretations through the instrumental additions which I considered\r\nvery badly applied in this score, I wrote for the original edition from\r\nParis. When I had made a thorough revision of the translation, with a\r\nview merely to the correctness of declamation, I was spurred on by my\r\nincreasing interest to revise the score itself. I tried to bring the\r\npoem as far as possible into agreement with Euripides’ play of the same\r\nname, by the elimination of everything which, in deference to French\r\ntaste, made the relationship between Achilles and Iphigenia one of\r\ntender love. The chief alteration of all was to cut out the inevitable\r\nmarriage at the end. For the sake of the vitality of the drama I tried\r\nto join the arias and choruses, which generally followed immediately\r\nupon each other without rhyme or reason, by connecting links, prologues\r\nand epilogues. In this I did my best, by the use of Gluck’s themes, to\r\nmake the interpolations of a strange composer as unnoticeable as\r\npossible. In the third act alone was I obliged to give Iphigenia, as\r\nwell as Artemis, whom I had myself introduced, recitatives of my own\r\ncomposition. Throughout the rest of the work I revised the whole\r\ninstrumentation more or less thoroughly, but only with the object of\r\nmaking the existing version produce the effect I desired. It was not\r\ntill the end of the year that I was able to finish this tremendous\r\ntask, and I had to postpone the completion of the third act of\r\nLohengrin, which I had already begun, until the New Year.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to claim my attention at the beginning of the year\r\n(1847) was the production of Iphigenia. I had to act as stage manager\r\nin this case, and was even obliged to help the scene-painters and the\r\nmechanicians over the smallest details. Owing to the fact that the\r\nscenes in this opera were generally strung together somewhat clumsily\r\nand without any apparent connection, it was necessary to recast them\r\ncompletely, in order so to animate the representation as to give to the\r\ndramatic action the life it lacked. A good deal of this faultiness of\r\nconstruction seemed to me due to the many conventional practices which\r\nwere prevalent at the Paris Opera in Gluck’s time. Mitterwurzer was the\r\nonly actor in the whole cast who gave me any pleasure. In the role of\r\nAgamemnon he showed a thorough grasp of that character, and carried out\r\nmy instructions and suggestions to the letter, so that he succeeded in\r\ngiving a really splendid and intelligent rendering of the part. The\r\nsuccess of the whole performance was far beyond my expectations, and\r\neven the directors were so surprised at the exceptional enthusiasm\r\naroused by one of Gluck’s operas, that for the second performance they,\r\non their own initiative, had my name put on the programme as ‘Reviser.’\r\nThis at once drew the attention of the critics to this work, and for\r\nonce they almost did me justice; my treatment of the overture, the only\r\npart of the opera which these gentlemen heard rendered in the usual\r\ntrivial way, was the only thing that they could find fault with. I have\r\ndiscussed and given an accurate account of all that relates to this in\r\na special article on ‘Gluck’s Overture to Iphigenia in Aulis’ and I\r\nonly wish to add here that the musician who made such strange comments\r\non this occasion was Ferdinand Hiller.\r\n\r\nAs in former years, the winter meetings of the various artistic\r\nelements in Dresden which Hiller had inaugurated, continued to take\r\nplace; but they now assumed more the character of ‘salons’ in Hiller’s\r\nown house, and it seemed to me intended solely for the purpose of\r\nlaying the foundations for a general recognition of Hiller’s artistic\r\ngreatness. He had already founded, among the more wealthy patrons of\r\nart, the chief of whom was the banker Kaskel, a society for running\r\nsubscription concerts. As it was impossible for the royal orchestra to\r\nbe placed at his disposal for this purpose, he had to content himself\r\nwith members of the town and military bands for his orchestra, and it\r\ncannot be denied that, thanks to his perseverance, he attained a\r\npraiseworthy result. As he produced many compositions which were still\r\nunknown in Dresden, especially from the domain of more modern music, I\r\nwas often tempted to go to his concerts. His chief bait to the general\r\npublic, however, seemed to lie in the fact that he presented unknown\r\nsingers (among whom, unfortunately, Jenny Lind was not to be found) and\r\nvirtuosos, one of which, Joachim, who was then very young, I became\r\nacquainted with.\r\n\r\nHiller’s treatment of those works with which I was already well\r\nacquainted, showed what his musical power was really worth. The\r\ncareless and indifferent manner in which he interpreted a Triple\r\nConcerto by Sebastian Bach positively astounded me. In the tempo di\r\nminuetto of the Eighth Symphony of Beethoven, I found that Hiller’s\r\nrendering was even more astonishing than Reissiger’s and Mendelssohn’s.\r\nI promised to be present at the performance of this symphony if I could\r\nrely on his giving a correct rendering of the tempo of the third\r\nphrase, which was generally so painfully distorted, He assured me that\r\nhe thoroughly agreed with me about it, and my disappointment at the\r\nperformance was all the greater when I found the well-known waltz\r\nmeasure adopted again. When I called him to account about it he excused\r\nhimself with a smile, saying that he had been seized with a fit of\r\ntemporary abstraction just at the beginning of the phrase in question,\r\nwhich had made him forget his promise. For inaugurating these concerts,\r\nwhich, as a matter of fact, only lasted for two seasons, Hiller was\r\ngiven a banquet, which I also had much pleasure in attending.\r\n\r\nPeople in these circles were surprised at that time to hear me speak,\r\noften with great animation, about Greek literature and history, but\r\nnever about music. In the course of my reading, which I zealously\r\npursued, and which drew me away from my professional activities to\r\nretirement and solitude, I was at that time impelled by my spiritual\r\nneeds to turn my attention once more to a systematic study of this\r\nall-important source of culture, with the object of filling the\r\nperceptible gap between my boyhood’s knowledge of the eternal elements\r\nof human culture and the neglect of this field of learning due to the\r\nlife I had been obliged to lead. In order to approach the real goal of\r\nmy desires—the study of Old and Middle High German—in the right frame\r\nof mind, I began again from the beginning with Greek antiquity, and was\r\nnow filled with such overwhelming enthusiasm for this subject that,\r\nwhenever I entered into conversation, and by hook or by crook had\r\nmanaged to get it round to this theme, I could only speak in terms of\r\nthe strongest emotion. I occasionally met some one who seemed to listen\r\nto what I had to say; on the whole, however, people preferred to talk\r\nto me only about the theatre because, since my production of Gluck’s\r\nIphigenia, they thought themselves justified in thinking I was an\r\nauthority on this subject. I received special recognition from a man to\r\nwhom I quite rightly gave the credit of being at least as well versed\r\nas myself in the matter. This was Eduard Devrient, who had been forced\r\nat that time to resign his position as stage manager-in-chief owing to\r\na plot against him on the part of the actors, headed by his own brother\r\nEmil. We were brought into closer sympathy by our conversations in\r\nconnection with this, which led him into dissertations on the\r\ntriviality and thorough hopelessness of our whole theatrical life,\r\nespecially under the ruining influence of ignorant court managers,\r\nwhich could never be overcome.\r\n\r\nWe were also drawn together by his intelligent understanding of the\r\npart I had played in the production of Iphigenia, which he compared\r\nwith the Berlin production of the same piece, that had been utterly\r\ncondemned by him. He was for a long time the only man with whom I could\r\ndiscuss, seriously and in detail, the real needs of the theatre and the\r\nmeans by which its defects might be remedied. Owing to his longer and\r\nmore specialised experience, there was much he could tell me and make\r\nclear to me; in particular he helped me successfully to overcome the\r\nidea that mere literary excellence is enough for the theatre, and\r\nconfirmed my conviction that the path to true prosperity lay only with\r\nthe stage itself and with the actors of the drama.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward, till I left Dresden, my intercourse with Eduard\r\nDevrient grew more and more friendly, though his dry nature and obvious\r\nlimitations as an actor had attracted me but little before. His highly\r\nmeritorious work, Die Geschichte der deutschen Schauspielkunst\r\n(‘History of German Dramatic Art’), which he finished and published\r\nabout that time, threw a fresh and instructive light on many problems\r\nwhich exercised my mind, and helped me to master them for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAt last I managed once more to resume my task of composing the third\r\nact of Lohengrin, which had been interrupted in the middle of the\r\nBridal Scene, and I finished it by the end of the winter. After the\r\nrepetition, by special request, of the Ninth Symphony at the concert on\r\nPalm Sunday had revived me, I tried to find comfort and refreshment for\r\nthe further progress of my new work by changing my abode, this time\r\nwithout asking permission. The old Marcolini palace, with a very large\r\ngarden laid out partly in the French style, was situated in an outlying\r\nand thinly populated suburb of Dresden.\r\n\r\nIt had been sold to the town council, and a part of it was to be let.\r\nThe sculptor, Hänel, whom I had known for a long time, and who had\r\ngiven me as a mark of friendship an ornament in the shape of a perfect\r\nplaster cast of one of the bas-reliefs from Beethoven’s monument\r\nrepresenting the Ninth Symphony, had taken the large rooms on the\r\nground floor of a side-wing of this palace for his dwelling and studio.\r\nAt Easter I moved into the spacious apartments, above him, the rent of\r\nwhich was extremely low, and found that the large garden planted with\r\nglorious trees, which was placed at my disposal, and the pleasant\r\nstillness of the whole place, not only provided mental food for the\r\nweary artist, but at the same time, by lessening my expenses, improved\r\nmy straitened finances. We soon settled down quite comfortably in the\r\nlong row of pleasant rooms without having incurred any unnecessary\r\nexpense, as Minna was very practical in her arrangements. The only real\r\ninconvenience which in the course of time I found our new home\r\npossessed, was its inordinate distance from the theatre. This was a\r\ngreat trial to me after fatiguing rehearsals and tiring performances,\r\nas the expense of a cab was a serious consideration. But we were\r\nfavoured by an exceptionally fine summer, which put me in a happy frame\r\nof mind, and soon helped to overcome every inconvenience.\r\n\r\nAt this time I insisted with the utmost firmness on refraining from\r\ntaking any further share in the management of the theatre, and I had\r\nmost cogent reasons to bring forth in defence of my conduct. All my\r\nendeavours to set in order the wilful chaos which prevailed in the use\r\nof the costly artistic materials at the disposal of this royal\r\ninstitution were repeatedly thwarted, merely because I wished to\r\nintroduce some method into the arrangements. In a carefully written\r\npamphlet which, in addition to my other work, I had compiled during the\r\npast winter, I had drawn up a plan for the reorganisation of the\r\norchestra, and had shown how we might increase the productive power of\r\nour artistic capital by making a more methodical use of the royal funds\r\nintended for its maintenance, and showing greater discretion regarding\r\nsalaries. This increase in the productive power would raise the\r\nartistic spirit as well as improve the economic position of the members\r\nof the orchestra, for I should have liked them at the same time to form\r\nan independent concert society. In such a capacity it would have been\r\ntheir task to present to the people of Dresden, in the best possible\r\nway, a kind of music which they had hitherto hardly had the opportunity\r\nof enjoying at all. It would have been possible for such a union,\r\nwhich, as I pointed out, had so many external circumstances in its\r\nfavour, to provide Dresden with a suitable concert-hall. I hear,\r\nhowever, that such a place is wanting to this day.\r\n\r\nWith this object in view I entered into close communication with\r\narchitects and builders, and the plans were completed, according to\r\nwhich the scandalous buildings facing a wing of the renowned prison\r\nopposite the Ostra Allee, and consisting of a shed for the members of\r\nthe theatre and a public wash-house, were to be pulled down and\r\nreplaced by a beautiful building, which, besides containing a large\r\nconcert-hall adapted to our requirements, would also have had other\r\nlarge rooms which could have been, let out on hire at a profit. The\r\npracticality of these plans was disputed by no one, as even the\r\nadministrators of the orchestra’s widows’ fund saw in them an\r\nopportunity for the safe and advantageous laying out of capital; yet\r\nthey were returned to me, after long consideration on the part of the\r\ngeneral management, with thanks and an acknowledgment of my careful\r\nwork, and the curt reply that it was thought better for things to\r\nremain as they were.\r\n\r\nAll my proposals for meeting the useless waste and drain upon our\r\nartistic capital by a more methodical arrangement, met with the same\r\nsuccess in every detail that I suggested. I had also found out by long\r\nexperience that every proposal which had to be discussed and decided\r\nupon in the most tiring committee meetings, as for instance the\r\nstarting of a repertoire, might at any moment be overthrown and altered\r\nfor the worse by the temper of a singer or the plan of a junior\r\nbusiness inspector. I was therefore driven to renounce my wasted\r\nefforts and, after many a stormy discussion and outspoken expression of\r\nmy sentiments, I withdrew from taking any part whatever in any branch\r\nof the management, and limited myself entirely to holding rehearsals\r\nand conducting performances of the operas provided for me.\r\n\r\nAlthough my relations with Lüttichau grew more and more strained on\r\nthis account, for the time being it mattered little whether my conduct\r\npleased him or not, as otherwise my position was one which commanded\r\nrespect, on account of the ever-increasing popularity of Tannhäuser and\r\nRienzi, which were presented during the summer to houses packed with\r\ndistinguished visitors, and were invariably chosen for the gala\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\nBy thus going my own way and refusing to be interfered with, I\r\nsucceeded this summer, amid the delightful and perfect seclusion of my\r\nnew home, in preserving myself in a frame of mind exceedingly\r\nfavourable to the completion of my Lohengrin. My studies, which, as I\r\nhave already mentioned, I pursued eagerly at the same time as I was\r\nworking on my opera, made me feel more light-hearted than I had ever\r\ndone before. For the first time I now mastered AEschylus with real\r\nfeeling and understanding. Droysen’s eloquent commentaries in\r\nparticular helped to bring before my imagination the intoxicating\r\neffect of the production of an Athenian tragedy, so that I could see\r\nthe Oresteia with my mind’s eye, as though it were actually being\r\nperformed, and its effect upon me was indescribable. Nothing, however,\r\ncould equal the sublime emotion with which the Agamemnon trilogy\r\ninspired me, and to the last word of the Eumenides I lived in an\r\natmosphere so far removed from the present day that I have never since\r\nbeen really able to reconcile myself with modern literature. My ideas\r\nabout the whole significance of the drama and of the theatre were,\r\nwithout a doubt, moulded by these impressions. I worked my way through\r\nthe other tragedians, and finally reached Aristophanes. When I had\r\nspent the morning industriously upon the completion of the music for\r\nLohengrin, I used to creep into the depths of a thick shrubbery in my\r\npart of the garden to get shelter from the summer heat, which was\r\nbecoming more intense every day. My delight in the comedies of\r\nAristophanes was boundless, when once his Birds had plunged me into the\r\nfull torrent of the genius of this wanton favourite of the Graces, as\r\nhe used to call himself with conscious daring. Side by side with this\r\npoet I read the principal dialogues of Plato, and from the Symposium I\r\ngained such a deep insight into the wonderful beauty of Greek life that\r\nI felt myself more truly at home in ancient Athens than in any\r\nconditions which the modern world has to offer.\r\n\r\nAs I was following out a settled course of self-education, I did not\r\nwish to pursue my way further in the leading-strings of any literary\r\nhistory, and I consequently turned my attention from the historical\r\nstudies, which seemed to be my own peculiar province, and in which\r\ndepartment Droysen’s history of Alexander and the Hellenistic period,\r\nas well as Niebuhr and Gibbon, were of great help to me, and fell back\r\nonce more upon my old and trusty guide, Jakob Grimm, for the study of\r\nGerman antiquity. In my efforts to master the myths of Germany more\r\nthoroughly than had been possible in my former perusal of the Nibelung\r\nand the Heldenbuch, Mone’s particularly suggestive commentary on this\r\nHeldensage filled me with delight, although stricter scholars regarded\r\nthis work with suspicion on account of the boldness of some of its\r\nstatements. By this means I was drawn irresistibly to the northern\r\nsagas; and I now tried, as far as was possible without a fluent\r\nknowledge of the Scandinavian languages, to acquaint myself with the\r\nEdda, as well as with the prose version which existed of a considerable\r\nportion of the Heldensage.\r\n\r\nRead by the light of Mone’s Commentaries, the Wolsungasaga had a\r\ndecided influence upon my method of handling this material. My\r\nconceptions as to the inner significance of these old-world legends,\r\nwhich had been growing for a long time, gradually gained strength and\r\nmoulded themselves with the plastic forms which inspired my later\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nAll this was sinking into my mind and slowly maturing, whilst with\r\nunfeigned delight I was finishing the music of the first two acts of\r\nLohengrin, which were now at last completed. I now succeeded in\r\nshutting out the past and building up for myself a new world of the\r\nfuture, which presented itself with ever-growing clearness to my mind\r\nas the refuge whither I might retreat from all the miseries of modern\r\nopera and theatre life. At the same time, my health and temper were\r\nsettling down into a mood of almost unclouded serenity, which made me\r\noblivious for a long time of all the worries of my position. I used to\r\nwalk every day up into the neighbouring hills, which rose from the\r\nbanks of the Elbe to the Plauenscher Grand. I generally went alone,\r\nexcept for the company of our little dog Peps, and my excursions always\r\nresulted in producing a satisfactory number of ideas. At the same time,\r\nI found I had developed a capacity, which I had never possessed before,\r\nfor good-tempered intercourse with the friends and acquaintances who\r\nliked to come from time to time to the Marcolini garden to share my\r\nsimple supper. My visitors used often to find me perched on a high\r\nbranch of a tree, or on the neck of the Neptune which was the central\r\nfigure of a large group of statuary in the middle of an old fountain,\r\nunfortunately always dry, belonging to the palmy days of the Marcolini\r\nestate. I used to enjoy walking with my friends up and down the broad\r\nfootpath of the drive leading to the real palace, which had been laid\r\nespecially for Napoleon in the fatal year 1813, when he had fixed his\r\nheadquarters there.\r\n\r\nBy August, the last month of summer, I had completely finished the\r\ncomposition of Lohengrin, and felt that it was high time for me to have\r\ndone so, as the needs of my position demanded imperatively that I\r\nshould give my most serious attention to improving it, and it became a\r\nmatter of supreme importance for me once more to take steps for having\r\nmy operas produced in the German theatres.\r\n\r\nEven the success of Tannhäuser in Dresden, which became more obvious\r\nevery day, did not attract the smallest notice anywhere else. Berlin\r\nwas the only place which had any influence in the theatrical world of\r\nGermany, and I ought long before to have given my undivided attention\r\nto that city. From all I had heard of the special tastes of Friedrich\r\nWilhelm IV., I felt perfectly justified in assuming that he would feel\r\nsympathetically inclined towards my later works and conceptions if I\r\ncould only manage to bring them to his notice in the right light. On\r\nthis hypothesis I had already thought of dedicating Tannhäuser to him,\r\nand to gain permission to do so I had to apply to Count Redern, the\r\ncourt musical director. From him I heard that the King could only\r\naccept the dedication of works which had actually been performed in his\r\npresence, and of which he thus had a personal knowledge. As my\r\nTannhäuser had been refused by the managers of the court theatre\r\nbecause it was considered too epic in form, the Count added that if I\r\nwished to remain firm in my resolve, there was only one way out of the\r\ndifficulty, and that was to adapt my opera as far as possible to a\r\nmilitary band, and try to bring it to the King’s notice on parade. This\r\ndrove me to determine upon another plan of attack on Berlin.\r\n\r\nAfter this experience I saw that I must open my campaign there with the\r\nopera that had won the most decided triumph in Dresden. I therefore\r\nobtained an audience of the Queen of Saxony, the sister of the King of\r\nPrussia, and begged her to use her influence with her brother to obtain\r\na performance in Berlin by royal command of my Rienzi, which was also a\r\nfavourite with the court of Saxony. This manœuvre was successful, and I\r\nsoon received a communication from my old friend Küstner to say that\r\nthe production of Rienzi was fixed for a very early date at the Berlin\r\nCourt Theatre, and at the same time expressing the hope that I would\r\nconduct my work in person. As a very handsome author’s royalty had been\r\npaid by this theatre, at the instigation of Küstner, on the occasion of\r\nthe production of his old Munich friend Lachner’s opera, Katharina von\r\nCornaro, I hoped to realise a very substantial improvement in my\r\nfinances if only the success of Rienzi in this city in any degree\r\nrivalled that in Dresden. But my chief desire was to make the\r\nacquaintance of the King of Prussia, so that I might read him the text\r\nof my Lohengrin, and arouse his interest in my work. This from various\r\nsigns I flattered myself was perfectly possible, in which case I\r\nintended to beg him to command the first performance of Lohengrin to be\r\ngiven at his court theatre.\r\n\r\nAfter my strange experiences as to the way in which my success in\r\nDresden had been kept secret from the rest of Germany, it seemed to me\r\na matter of vital importance to make the future centre of my artistic\r\nenterprises the only place which exercised any influence on the outside\r\nworld, and as such I was forced to regard Berlin. Inspired by the\r\nsuccess of my recommendation to the Queen of Prussia, I hoped to gain\r\naccess to the King himself, which I regarded as a most important step.\r\nFull of confidence, and in excellent spirits, I set out for Berlin in\r\nSeptember, trusting to a favourable turn of Fortune’s wheel, in the\r\nfirst place for the rehearsals of Rienzi, though my interests were no\r\nlonger centred in this work.\r\n\r\nBerlin made the same impression on me as on the occasion of my former\r\nvisit, when I saw it again after my long absence in Paris. Professor\r\nWerder, my friend of the Fliegender Holländer, had taken lodgings for\r\nme in advance in the renowned Gensdarmeplatz, but when I looked at the\r\nview from my windows every day I could not believe that I was in a city\r\nwhich was the very centre of Germany. Soon, however, I was completely\r\nabsorbed by the cares of the task I had in hand.\r\n\r\nI had nothing to complain of with regard to the official preparations\r\nfor Rienzi, but I soon noticed that it was looked upon merely as a\r\nconductor’s opera, that is to say, all the materials to hand were duly\r\nplaced at my disposal, but the management had not the slightest\r\nintention of doing anything more for me. All the arrangements for my\r\nrehearsals were entirely upset as soon as a visit from Jenny Lind was\r\nannounced, and she occupied the Royal Opera exclusively for some time.\r\n\r\nDuring the delay thus caused I did all I could to attain my main\r\nobject—an introduction to the King—and for this purpose made use of my\r\nformer acquaintance with the court musical director, Count Redern. This\r\ngentleman received me at once with the greatest affability, invited me\r\nto dinner and a soiree, and entered into a hearty discussion with me\r\nabout the steps necessary for attaining my purpose, in which he\r\npromised to do his utmost to help me. I also paid frequent visits to\r\nSans-Souci, in order to pay my respects to the Queen and express my\r\nthanks to her. But I never got further than an interview with the\r\nladies-in-waiting, and I was advised to put myself into communication\r\nwith M. Illaire, the head of the Royal Privy Council. This gentleman\r\nseemed to be impressed by the seriousness of my request, and promised\r\nto do what he could to further my wish for a personal introduction to\r\nthe King. He asked what my real object was, and I told him it was to\r\nget permission from the King to read my libretto Lohengrin to him. On\r\nthe occasion of one of my oft-repeated visits from Berlin, he asked me\r\nwhether I did not think it would be advisable to bring a recommendation\r\nof my work from Tieck. I was able to tell him that I had already had\r\nthe pleasure of bringing my case to the notice of the old poet, who\r\nlived near Potsdam as a royal pensioner.\r\n\r\nI remembered very well that Frau von Lüttichau had sent the themes\r\nLohengrin and Tannhäuser to her old friend some years ago, when these\r\nmatters were first mentioned between us. When I called upon Tieck, I\r\nwas welcomed by him almost as a friend, and I found my long talks with\r\nhim exceedingly valuable. Although Tieck had perhaps gained a somewhat\r\ndoubtful reputation for the leniency with which he would give his\r\nrecommendation for the dramatic works of those who applied to him, yet\r\nI was pleased by the genuine disgust with which he spoke of our latest\r\ndramatic literature, which was modelling itself on the style of modern\r\nFrench stagecraft, and his complaint at the utter lack of any true\r\npoetic feeling in it was heartfelt. He declared himself delighted with\r\nmy poem of Lohengrin, but could not understand how all this was to be\r\nset to music without a complete change in the conventional structure of\r\nan opera, and on this score he objected to such scenes as that between\r\nOrtrud and Frederick at the beginning of the second act. I thought I\r\nhad roused him to a real enthusiasm when I explained how I proposed to\r\nsolve these apparent difficulties, and also described my own ideals\r\nabout musical drama. But the higher I soared the sadder he grew when I\r\nhad once made known to him my hope of securing the patronage of the\r\nKing of Prussia for these conceptions, and the working out of my scheme\r\nfor an ideal drama. He had no doubt that the King would listen to me\r\nwith the greatest interest, and even seize upon my ideas with warmth,\r\nonly I must not entertain the smallest hope of any practical result,\r\nunless I wished to expose myself to the bitterest disappointment. ‘What\r\ncan you expect from a man who to-day is enthusiastic about Gluck’s\r\nIphigenia in Tauris, and to-morrow mad about Donizetti’s Lucrezia\r\nBorgia?’ he said. Tieck’s conversation about these and similar topics\r\nwas much too entertaining and charming for me to give any serious\r\nweight to the bitterness of his views. He gladly promised to recommend\r\nmy poem, more particularly to Privy Councillor Illaire, and dismissed\r\nme with hearty goodwill and his sincere though anxious blessing. The\r\nonly result of all my labours was that the desired invitation from the\r\nKing still hung fire. As the rehearsals for Rienzi, which had been\r\npostponed on account of Jenny Lind’s visit, were being carried on\r\nseriously again, I made up my mind to take no further trouble before\r\nthe performance of my opera, as I thought myself, at any rate,\r\njustified in counting on the presence of the monarch on the first\r\nnight, as the piece was being played at his express command, and at the\r\nsame time I hoped this would conduce to the fulfilment of my main\r\nobject. However, the nearer we came to the event the lower did the\r\nhopes I had built upon it sink. To play the part of the hero I had to\r\nbe satisfied with a tenor who was absolutely devoid of talent, and far\r\nbelow the average. He was a conscientious, painstaking man, and had\r\nmoreover been strongly recommended to me by my kind host, the renowned\r\nMeinhard. After I had taken infinite pains with him, and had in\r\nconsequence, as so often happens, conjured up in my mind certain\r\nillusions as to what I might expect from his acting, I was obliged,\r\nwhen it came to the final test of the dress rehearsal, to confess my\r\ntrue opinion. I realised that the scenery, chorus, ballet, and minor\r\nparts were on the whole excellent, but that the chief character, around\r\nwhom in this particular opera everything centred, faded into an\r\ninsignificant phantom. The reception which this opera met with at the\r\nhands of the public when it was produced in October was also due to\r\nhim; but in consequence of the fairly good rendering of a few brilliant\r\npassages, and more especially on account of the enthusiastic\r\nrecognition of Frau Koster in the part of Adriano, it might have been\r\nconcluded from all the external signs that the opera had been fairly\r\nsuccessful. Nevertheless, I knew very well that this seeming triumph\r\ncould have no real substance, as only the immaterial parts of my work\r\ncould reach the eyes and ears of the audience; its essential spirit had\r\nnot entered their hearts. Moreover, the Berlin reviewers in their usual\r\nway began their attacks immediately, with the view of demolishing any\r\nsuccess my opera might have won, so that after the second performance,\r\nwhich I also conducted myself, I began to wonder whether my desperate\r\nlabours were really worth while.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked the few intimate friends I had their opinion on this\r\npoint, I elicited much valuable information. Among these friends I must\r\nmention, in the first place, Hermann Franck, whom I found again. He had\r\nlately settled in Berlin, and did much to encourage me. I spent the\r\nmost enjoyable part of those sad two months in his company, of which,\r\nhowever, I had but too little. Our conversation generally turned upon\r\nreminiscences of the old days, and on to topics which had no connection\r\nwith the theatre, so that I was almost ashamed to trouble him with my\r\ncomplaints on this subject, especially as they concerned my worries\r\nabout a work which I could not pretend was of any practical importance\r\nto the stage. He for his part soon arrived at the conclusion that it\r\nhad been foolish of me to choose my Rienzi for this occasion, as it was\r\nan opera which appealed merely to the general public, in preference to\r\nmy Tannhäuser, which might have educated a party in Berlin useful to my\r\nhigher aims. He maintained that the very nature of this work would have\r\naroused a fresh interest in the drama in the minds of people who, like\r\nhimself, were no longer to be counted among regular theatre-goers,\r\nprecisely because they had given up all hope of ever finding any nobler\r\nideals of the stage.\r\n\r\nThe curious information as to the character of Berlin art in other\r\nrespects, which Werder gave me from time to time, was most\r\ndiscouraging. With regard to the public, he told me once that at a\r\nperformance of an unknown work, it was quite useless for me to expect a\r\nsingle member of the audience from the stalls to the gallery to take\r\nhis seat with any better object in view than to pick as many holes as\r\npossible in the production. Although Werder did not wish to discourage\r\nme in any of my endeavours, he felt himself obliged to warn me\r\ncontinually not to expect anything above the average from the cultured\r\nsociety of Berlin. He liked to see proper respect paid to the really\r\nconsiderable gifts of the King; and when I asked him how he thought the\r\nlatter would receive my ideas about the ennobling of opera, he\r\nanswered, after having listened attentively to a long and fiery tirade\r\non my part: ‘The King would say to you, “Go and consult Stawinsky!”’\r\nThis was the opera manager, a fat, smug creature who had grown rusty in\r\nfollowing out the most jog-trot routine. In short, everything I learned\r\nwas calculated to discourage me. I called on Bernhard Marx, who some\r\nyears ago had shown a kindly interest in my Fliegender Holländer, and\r\nwas courteously received by him. This man, who in his earlier writings\r\nand musical criticisms had seemed to me filled with a fire of energy,\r\nnow struck me as extraordinarily limp and listless when I saw him by\r\nthe side of his young wife, who was radiantly and bewitchingly\r\nbeautiful. From his conversation I soon learned that he also had\r\nabandoned even the remotest hope of success for any efforts directed\r\ntowards the object so dear to both our hearts, on account of the\r\ninconceivable shallowness of all the officials connected with the head\r\nauthority. He told me of the extraordinary fate which had befallen a\r\nscheme he had brought to the notice of the King for founding a school\r\nof music. In a special audience the King had gone into the matter with\r\nthe greatest interest, and noticed the minutest detail, so that Marx\r\nfelt justified in entertaining the strongest possible hopes of success.\r\nHowever, all his labours and negotiations about the business, in the\r\ncourse of which he was driven from pillar to post, proved utterly\r\nfutile, until at last he was told to have an interview with a certain\r\ngeneral. This personage, like the King, had Marx’s proposals explained\r\nto him in the minutest detail, and expressed his warmest sympathy with\r\nthe undertaking. ‘And there,’ said Marx, at the end of this long\r\nrigmarole, ‘the matter ended, and I never heard another word about it.’\r\n\r\nOne day I learned that Countess Rossi, the renowned Henriette Sontag,\r\nwho was living in quiet seclusion in Berlin, had pleasant recollections\r\nof me in Dresden, and wished me to visit her. She had at this time\r\nalready fallen into the unfortunate position which was so detrimental\r\nto her artistic career. She too complained bitterly of the general\r\napathy of the influential classes in Berlin, which effectually\r\nprevented any artistic aims from being realised. It was her opinion\r\nthat the King found a sort of satisfaction in knowing that the theatre\r\nwas badly managed, for though he never opposed any criticisms which he\r\nreceived on the subject, he likewise never supported any proposal for\r\nits improvement. She expressed a wish to know something of my latest\r\nwork, and I gave her my poem of Lohengrin for perusal. On the occasion\r\nof my next morning call she told me she would send me an invitation to\r\na musical evening which she was going to have at her house in honour of\r\nthe Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, her elderly patron, and she\r\nalso gave me back the manuscript of Lohengrin, with the assurance that\r\nit had appealed to her very much, and that while she was reading it she\r\nhad often seen the little fairies and elves dancing about in front of\r\nher. As in the old days I had been heartily encouraged by the warm and\r\nfriendly sympathy of this naturally cultured woman, I now felt as if\r\ncold water had been suddenly poured down my back. I soon took my leave,\r\nand never saw her again. Indeed, I had no particular object in doing\r\nso, as the promised invitation never came. Herr E. Kossak also sought\r\nme out, and although our acquaintance did not lead to much, I was\r\nsufficiently kindly received by him to give him my poem of Lohengrin to\r\nread. I went one day by appointment to see him, and found that his room\r\nhad just been scrubbed with boiling water. The steam from this\r\noperation was so unbearable that it had already given him a headache,\r\nand was not less disagreeable to me. He looked into my face with an\r\nalmost tender expression when he gave me back the manuscript of my\r\npoem, and assured me, in accents which admitted of no doubt of his\r\nsincerity, that he thought it ‘very pretty.’\r\n\r\nI found my casual intercourse with H. Truhn rather more entertaining. I\r\nused to treat him to a good glass of wine at Lutter and Wegener’s,\r\nwhere I went occasionally on account of its association with Hoffmann,\r\nand he would then listen with apparently growing interest to my ideas\r\nas to the possible development of opera and the goal at which we should\r\naim. His comments were generally witty and very much to the point, and\r\nhis lively and animated ways pleased me very much. After the production\r\nof Rienzi, however, he too, as a critic, joined the majority of\r\nscoffers and detractors. The only person who supported me stoutly but\r\nuselessly, through thick and thin, was my old friend Gaillard. His\r\nlittle music-shop was not a success, his musical journal had already\r\nfailed, so that he was only able to help me in small ways.\r\nUnfortunately I discovered not only that he was the author of many\r\nexceedingly dubious dramatic works, for which he wished to gain my\r\nsupport, but also that he was apparently in the last stages of the\r\ndisease from which he was suffering, so that the little intercourse I\r\nhad with him, in spite of all his fidelity and devotion, only exercised\r\na melancholy and depressing influence upon me.\r\n\r\nBut as I had embarked upon this Berlin enterprise in contradiction to\r\nall my inmost wishes, and prompted solely by the desire of winning the\r\nsuccess so vital to my position, I made up my mind to make a personal\r\nappeal to Rellstab.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the Fliegender Holländer he had taken exception more\r\nparticularly to its ‘nebulousness’ and ‘lack of form,’ I thought I\r\nmight with advantage point out to him the brighter and clearer outline\r\nof Rienzi. He seemed to be pleased at my thinking I could get anything\r\nout of him, but told me at once of his firm conviction that any new art\r\nform was utterly impossible after Gluck, and that the only thing that\r\nthe best of good luck and hard work was capable of producing was\r\nmeaningless bombast. I then realised that in Berlin all hope had been\r\nabandoned. I was told that Meyerbeer was the only man who had been able\r\nin any way to master the situation.\r\n\r\nThis former patron of mine I met once more in Berlin, and he declared\r\nthat he still took an interest in me. As soon as I arrived I called on\r\nhim, but in the hall I found his servant busy packing up trunks, and\r\nlearned that Meyerbeer was just going away. His master confirmed this\r\nassertion, and regretted that he would not be able to do anything for\r\nme, so I had to say good-bye and how-do-you-do at the same time. For\r\nsome time I thought he really was away, but after a few weeks I learned\r\nto my surprise that he was still staying in Berlin without letting\r\nhimself be seen by any one, and at last he made his appearance again at\r\none of the rehearsals of Rienzi. What this meant I only discovered\r\nlater from a rumour which was circulated among the initiated, and\r\nimparted to me by Eduard von Bulow, my young friend’s father. Without\r\nhaving the slightest idea how it originated, I learned, about the\r\nmiddle of my stay in Berlin, from the conductor Taubert, that he had\r\nheard on very good authority that I was trying for a director’s post at\r\nthe court theatre, and had good expectations of securing the\r\nappointment in addition to special privileges. In order to remain on\r\ngood terms with Taubert, as it was very necessary for me to do, I had\r\nto give him the most solemn assurances that such an idea had never even\r\nentered my head, and that I would not accept such a position if it were\r\noffered to me. On the other hand, all my endeavours to get access to\r\nthe King continued to be fruitless. My chief mediator, to whom I always\r\nturned, was still Count Redern, and although my attention had been\r\ncalled to his staunch adherence to Meyerbeer, his extraordinary open\r\nand friendly manner always strengthened my belief in his honesty. At\r\nlast the only medium that remained open to me was the fact that the\r\nKing could not possibly stay away from the performance of Rienzi, given\r\nat his express command, and on this conviction I based all further hope\r\nof approaching him. Whereupon Count Redern informed me, with an\r\nexpression of deep despair, that on the very day of the first\r\nperformance the monarch would be away on a hunting party. Once more I\r\nbegged him to make very effort in his power to secure the King’s\r\npresence, at least at the second performance, and at length my\r\ninexhaustible patron told me that he could not make head or tail of it,\r\nbut his Majesty seemed to have conceived an utter disinclination to\r\naccede to my wish; he himself had heard these hard words fall from the\r\nroyal lips: ‘Oh bother! have you come to me again with your Rienzi?’\r\n\r\nAt this second performance I had a pleasant experience. After the\r\nimpressive second act the public showed signs of wishing to call me,\r\nand as I went from the orchestra to the vestibule, in order to be ready\r\nif necessary, my foot slipped on the smooth parquet, and I might have\r\nhad perhaps a serious fall had I not felt my arm grasped by a strong\r\nhand. I turned, and recognised the Crown Prince of Prussia,[14] who had\r\ncome out of his box, and who at once seized the opportunity of inviting\r\nme to follow him to his wife, who wished to make my acquaintance. She\r\nhad only just arrived in Berlin, and told me that she had heard my\r\nopera for the first time that evening, and expressed her appreciation\r\nof it. She had, however, long ago received very favourable reports of\r\nme and my artistic aims from a common friend, Alwine Frommann. The\r\nwhole tenor of this interview, at which the Prince was present, was\r\nunusually friendly and pleasant.\r\n\r\n [14] This Prince subsequently became the Emperor William the First. He\r\n was given the title of Crown Prince in 1840 on the death of his\r\n father, Frederick William III., as he was then heir-presumptive to his\r\n brother, Frederick William IV., whose marriage was without\r\n issue.—EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was indeed my old friend Alwine who in Berlin had not only followed\r\nall my fortunes with the greatest sympathy, but had also done all in\r\nher power to give me consolation and courage to endure. Almost every\r\nevening, when the day’s business made it possible, I used to visit her\r\nfor an hour of recreation, and gain strength from her ennobling\r\nconversation for the struggle against the reverses of the following\r\nday. I was particularly pleased by the warm and intelligent sympathy\r\nwhich she and our mutual friend Werder devoted to Lohengrin, the object\r\nof all my labours at that time. On the arrival of her friend and\r\npatroness, the Crown Princess, which had been delayed till now, she\r\nhoped to hear something more definite as to how my affairs stood with\r\nthe King, although she intimated to me that even this great lady was in\r\ndeep disfavour, and could only bring her influence to bear upon the\r\nKing by observing the strictest etiquette. But from this source also no\r\nnews reached me till it was time for me to leave Berlin and I could\r\npostpone my departure no longer.\r\n\r\nAs I had to conduct a third performance of Rienzi, and there still\r\nremained a remote possibility of receiving a sudden command to\r\nSans-Souci, I accordingly fixed on a date which would be the very\r\nlatest I could wait to ascertain the fate of the projects I had nearest\r\nto heart. This period passed by, and I was forced to realise that my\r\nhopes of Berlin were wholly shattered.\r\n\r\nI was in a very depressed state when I made up my mind to this\r\nconclusion. I can seldom remember having been so dreadfully affected by\r\nthe influence of cold and wet weather and an eternally grey sky as\r\nduring those last wretched weeks in Berlin, when everything that I\r\nheard, in addition to my own private anxieties, weighed upon me with a\r\nleaden weight of discouragement.\r\n\r\nMy conversations with Hermann Franck about the social and political\r\nsituation had assumed a peculiarly gloomy tone, as the King of\r\nPrussia’s efforts to summon a united conference had failed. I was among\r\nthose who had at first been inclined to see a hopeful significance in\r\nthis undertaking, but it was a shock to have all the intimate details\r\nrelating to the project clearly set before me by so well informed a man\r\nas Franck. His dispassionate views on this subject, as well as on the\r\nPrussian State in particular, which was supposed to be representative\r\nof German intelligence, and was universally considered to be a model of\r\norder and good government, so completely disillusioned me and destroyed\r\nall the favourable and hopeful opinions I had formed of it, that I felt\r\nas if I had plunged into chaos, and realised the utter futility of\r\nexpecting a prosperous settlement of the German question from this\r\nquarter. If in the midst of my misery in Dresden I had founded great\r\nhopes from gaining the King of Prussia’s sympathy for my ideas, I could\r\nno longer close my eyes to the fearful hollowness which the state of\r\naffairs disclosed to me on every side.\r\n\r\nIn this despairing mood I felt but little emotion when, on going to say\r\ngood-bye to Count Redern, he told me with a very sad face the news,\r\nwhich had just arrived, of Mendelssohn’s death. I certainly did not\r\nrealise this stroke of fate, which Redern’s obvious grief first brought\r\nto my notice. At all events, he was spared more detailed and heartfelt\r\nexplanation of my own affairs, which he had so much at heart.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that remained for me to do in Berlin was to try and make\r\nmy material success balance my material loss. For a stay of two months,\r\nduring which my wife and my sister Clara had been with me, lured on by\r\nthe hope that the production of Rienzi in Berlin would be a brilliant\r\nsuccess, I found my old friend, Director Küstner, by no means inclined\r\nto compensate me. From his correspondence with me he could prove up to\r\nthe hilt that legally he had only expressed the desire for my\r\nco-operation in studying Rienzi, but had given me no positive\r\ninvitation. As I was prevented by Count Redern’s grief over\r\nMendelssohn’s death from going to him for help in these trivial private\r\nconcerns, there was no alternative but for me to accept with a good\r\ngrace Küstner’s beneficence in paying me on the spot the royalties on\r\nthe three performances which had already taken place. The Dresden\r\nauthorities were surprised when I found myself obliged to beg an\r\nadvance of income from them in order to conclude this brilliant\r\nundertaking in Berlin.\r\n\r\nAs I was travelling with my wife in the most horrible weather through\r\nthe deserted country on my way home, I fell into a mood of the blackest\r\ndespair, which I thought I might perhaps survive once in a lifetime but\r\nnever again. Nevertheless, it amused me, as I sat silently looking out\r\nof the carriage into the grey mist, to hear my wife enter into a lively\r\ndiscussion with a commercial traveller who, in the course of friendly\r\nconversation, had spoken in a disparaging way about the ‘new opera\r\nRienzi.’ My wife, with great heat and even passion, corrected various\r\nmistakes made by this hostile critic, and to her great satisfaction\r\nmade him confess that he had not heard the opera himself, but had only\r\nbased his opinion upon hearsay and the reviews. Whereupon my wife\r\npointed out to him most earnestly that ‘he could not possibly know\r\nwhose future he might not injure by such irresponsible comment.’\r\n\r\nThese were the only cheering and consoling impressions which I carried\r\nback with me to Dresden, where I soon felt the direct results of the\r\nreverses I had suffered in Berlin in the condolences of my\r\nacquaintances. The papers had spread abroad the news that my opera had\r\nbeen a dismal failure. The most painful part of the whole proceeding\r\nwas that I had to meet these expressions of pity with a cheerful\r\ncountenance and the assurance that things were by no means so bad as\r\nhad been made out, but that, on the contrary, I had had many pleasant\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nThis unaccustomed effort placed me in a position strangely similar to\r\nthat in which I found Hiller on my return to Dresden. He had given a\r\nperformance of his new opera, Conradin von Hohenstaufen, here just\r\nabout this time. He had kept the composition of this work a secret from\r\nme, and had hoped to make a decided hit with it after the three\r\nperformances which took place in my absence. Both the poet and the\r\ncomposer thought that in this work they had combined the tendencies and\r\neffects of my Rienzi with those of my Tannhäuser in a manner peculiarly\r\nsuited to the Dresden public. As he was just setting out for\r\nDusseldorf, where he had been appointed concert-director, he commended\r\nhis work with great confidence to my tender mercies, and regretted not\r\nhaving the power of appointing me the conductor of it. He acknowledged\r\nthat he owed his great success partly to the wonderfully happy\r\nrendering of the male part of Conradin by my niece Johanna. She, in her\r\nturn, told me with equal confidence that without her Hiller’s opera\r\nwould not have had such an extraordinary triumph. I was now really\r\nanxious to see this fortunate work and its wonderful staging for\r\nmyself; and this I was able to do, as a fourth performance was\r\nannounced after Hiller and his family had left Dresden for good. When I\r\nentered the theatre at the beginning of the overture to take my place\r\nin the stalls, I was astonished to find all the seats, with a few\r\nscarcely noticeable exceptions, absolutely empty. At the other end of\r\nmy row I saw the poet who had written the libretto, the gentle painter\r\nReinike. We moved, naturally, towards the middle of the space and\r\ndiscussed the strange position in which we found ourselves. He poured\r\nout melancholy complaints to me about Hiller’s musical setting to his\r\npoetry; the secret of the mistake which Hiller had made about the\r\nsuccess of his work he did not explain, and was evidently very much\r\nupset at the conspicuous failure of the opera. It was from another\r\nquarter that I learned how it had been possible for Hiller to deceive\r\nhimself in such an extraordinary way. Frau Hiller, who was of Polish\r\norigin, had managed at the frequent Polish gatherings which took place\r\nin Dresden to persuade a large contingent of her countrymen, who were\r\nkeen theatre-goers, to attend her husband’s opera. On the first night\r\nthese friends, with their usual enthusiasm, incited the public to\r\napplaud, but had themselves found so little pleasure in the work that\r\nthey had stayed away from the second performance, which was otherwise\r\nbadly attended, so that the opera could only be considered a failure.\r\nBy commandeering all the help that could possibly be got from the Poles\r\nby way of applause, every effort was made to secure a third performance\r\non a Sunday, when the theatre generally filled of its own accord. This\r\nobject was achieved, and the Polish theatre aristocracy, with the\r\ncharity that was habitual to them, fulfilled their duty towards the\r\nneedy couple in whose drawing-room they had often spent such pleasant\r\nevenings.\r\n\r\nOnce more the composer was called before the curtain, and everything\r\nwent off well. Hiller thereupon placed his confidence in the verdict on\r\nthe third performance, according to which his opera was an undoubted\r\nsuccess, just as had been the case with my Tannhäuser. The\r\nartificiality of this proceeding was, however, exposed by this fourth\r\nperformance, at which I was present, and at which no one was under an\r\nobligation to the departed composer to attend. Even my niece was\r\ndisgusted with it, and thought that the best singer in the world could\r\nnot make a success of such a tedious opera. Whilst we were watching\r\nthis miserable performance I managed to point out to the poet some\r\nweaknesses and faults that were to be found in the subject-matter. The\r\nlatter reported my criticisms to Hiller, whereupon I received a warm\r\nand friendly letter from Dusseldorf, in which Hiller acknowledged the\r\nmistake he had made in rejecting my advice on this point. He gave me\r\nplainly to understand that it was not too late to alter the opera\r\naccording to my suggestions; I should thus have had the inestimable\r\nbenefit of having such an obviously well-intentioned, and, in its way,\r\nso significant, a work in the repertoire, but I never got so far as\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I experienced the small satisfaction of hearing the\r\nnews that two performances of my Rienzi had taken place in Berlin, for\r\nthe success of which Conductor Taubert, as he informed me himself,\r\nthought he had won some credit on account of the extremely effective\r\ncombinations he had arranged. In spite of this, I was absolutely\r\nconvinced that I must abandon all hope of any lasting and profitable\r\nsuccess from Berlin, and I could no longer hide from Lüttichau that, if\r\nI were to continue in the discharge of my duties with the necessary\r\ngood spirits, I must insist on a rise of salary, as, beyond my regular\r\nincome, I could not rely on any substantial success wherewith to meet\r\nmy unlucky publishing transactions. My income was so small that I could\r\nnot even live on it, but I asked nothing more than to be placed on an\r\nequal footing with my colleague Reissiger, a prospect which had been\r\nheld out to me from the beginning.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Lüttichau saw a favourable opportunity for making me\r\nfeel my dependence on his goodwill, which could only be secured by my\r\nshowing due deference to his wishes. After I had laid my case before\r\nthe King, at a personal interview, and asked for the favour of the\r\nmoderate increase in income which was my object, Lüttichau promised to\r\nmake the report he was obliged to give of me as favourable as possible.\r\nHow great was my consternation and humiliation when one day he opened\r\nour interview by telling me that his report had come back from the\r\nKing. In it was set forth that I had unfortunately overestimated my\r\ntalent on account of the foolish praise of various friends in a high\r\nposition (among whom he counted Frau v. Konneritz), and had thus been\r\nled to consider that I had quite as good a right to success as\r\nMeyerbeer. I had thereby caused such serious offence that it might,\r\nperhaps, be considered advisable to dismiss me altogether. On the other\r\nhand, my industry and my praiseworthy performance with regard to the\r\nrevision of Gluck’s Iphigenia, which had been brought to the notice of\r\nthe management, might justify my being given another chance, in which\r\ncase my material condition must be given due consideration. At this\r\npoint I could read no further, and stupefied by surprise I gave my\r\npatron back the paper. He tried at once to remove the obviously bad\r\nimpression it had made upon me by telling me that my wish had been\r\ngranted, and I could draw the nine hundred marks belonging to me at\r\nonce from the bank. I took my leave in silence, and pondered over what\r\ncourse of action I must pursue in face of this disgrace, as it was\r\nquite out of the question for me to accept the nine hundred marks.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of these adversities a visit of the King of Prussia to\r\nDresden was one day announced, and at the same time by his special\r\nrequest a performance of Tannhäuser was arranged. He really did make\r\nhis appearance in the theatre at this performance in the company of the\r\nroyal family of Saxony, and stayed with apparent interest from\r\nbeginning to end. On this occasion the King gave a curious explanation\r\nfor having stayed away from the performances of Rienzi in Berlin, which\r\nwas afterwards reported to me. He said he had denied himself the\r\npleasure of hearing one of my operas in Berlin, because it was\r\nimportant to get a good impression of them, and he knew that in his own\r\ntheatre they would only be badly produced. This strange event had, at\r\nany rate, the result of giving me back sufficient self-confidence to\r\naccept the nine hundred marks of which I was in such desperate need.\r\n\r\nLüttichau also seemed to make a point of winning back my trust to some\r\nextent, and I gathered from his calm friendliness that I must suppose\r\nthis wholly uncultured man had no consciousness of the outrage he had\r\ndone me. He returned to the idea of having orchestral concerts, in\r\naccordance with the suggestions I had made in my rejected report on the\r\norchestra, and in order to induce me to arrange such musical\r\nperformances in the theatre, said the initiative had come from the\r\nmanagement and not from the orchestra itself. As soon as I discovered\r\nthat the profits were to go to the orchestra I willingly entered into\r\nthe plan. By a special device of my own the stage of the theatre was\r\nmade into a concert-hall (afterwards considered first-class) by means\r\nof a sounding board enclosing the whole orchestra, which proved a great\r\nsuccess. In future six performances were to take place during the\r\nwinter months. This time, however, as it was the end of the year, and\r\nwe only had the second half of the winter before us, subscription\r\ntickets were issued for only three concerts, and the whole available\r\nspace in the theatre was filled by the public. I found the preparations\r\nfor this fairly diverting, and entered upon the fateful year 1848 in a\r\nrather more reconciled and amiable frame of mind.\r\n\r\nEarly in the New Year the first of these orchestral concerts took\r\nplace, and brought me much popularity on account of its unusual\r\nprogramme. I had discovered that if any real significance were to be\r\ngiven to these concerts, in distinction to those consisting of\r\nheterogeneous scraps of music of every different species under the sun,\r\nand which are so opposed to all serious artistic taste, we could only\r\nafford to give two kinds of genuine music alternately if a good effect\r\nwas to be produced. Accordingly between two symphonies I placed one or\r\ntwo longer vocal pieces, which were not to be heard elsewhere, and\r\nthese were the only items in the whole concert. After the Mozart\r\nSymphony in D major, I made all the musicians move from their places to\r\nmake room for an imposing choir, which had to sing Palestrina’s Stabat\r\nMater, from an adaptation of the original recitative, which I had\r\ncarefully revised, and Bach’s Motet for eight voices: Singet dem Herrn\r\nein neues Lied (‘Sing unto the Lord a new song’); thereupon I let the\r\norchestra again take its place to play Beethoven’s Sinfonia Eroica, and\r\nwith that to end the concert.\r\n\r\nThis success was very encouraging, and disclosed to me a somewhat\r\nconsoling prospect of increasing my influence as musical conductor at a\r\ntime when my disgust was daily growing stronger at the constant\r\nmeddling with our opera repertoire, which made me lose more and more\r\ninfluence as compared with the wishes of my would-be prima donna niece,\r\nwhom even Tichatschek supported. Immediately on my return from Berlin I\r\nhad begun the orchestration of Lohengrin, and in all other respects had\r\ngiven myself up to greater resignation, which made me feel I could face\r\nmy fate calmly, when I suddenly received a very disturbing piece of\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of February my mother’s death was announced to me. I\r\nat once hastened to her funeral at Leipzig, and was filled with deep\r\nemotion and joy at the wonderfully calm and sweet expression of her\r\nface. She had passed the latter years of her life, which had before\r\nbeen so active and restless, in cheerful ease, and at the end in\r\npeaceful and almost childlike happiness. On her deathbed she exclaimed\r\nin humble modesty, and with a bright smile on her face: ‘Oh! how\r\nbeautiful! how lovely! how divine! Why do I deserve such favour?’ It\r\nwas a bitterly cold morning when we lowered the coffin into the grave\r\nin the churchyard, and the hard, frozen lumps of earth which we\r\nscattered on the lid, instead of the customary handful of dust,\r\nfrightened me by the loud noise they made. On the way home to the house\r\nof my brother-in-law, Hermann Brockhaus, where the whole family were to\r\ngather together for an hour, Laube, of whom my mother had been very\r\nfond, was my only companion. He expressed his anxiety at my unusually\r\nexhausted appearance, and when he afterwards accompanied me to the\r\nstation, we discussed the unbearable burden which seemed to us to lie\r\nlike a dead weight on every noble effort made to resist the tendency of\r\nthe time to sink into utter worthlessness. On my return to Dresden the\r\nrealisation of my complete loneliness came over me for the first time\r\nwith full consciousness, as I could not help knowing that with the loss\r\nof my mother every natural bond of union was loosened with my brothers\r\nand sisters, each of whom was taken up with his or her own family\r\naffairs. So I plunged dully and coldly into the only thing which could\r\ncheer and warm me, the working out of my Lohengrin and my studies of\r\nGerman antiquity.\r\n\r\nThus dawned the last days of February, which were to plunge Europe once\r\nmore into revolution. I was among those who least expected a probable\r\nor even possible overthrow of the political world. My first knowledge\r\nof such things had been gained in my youth at the time of the July\r\nRevolution, and the long and peaceful reaction that followed it. Since\r\nthen I had become acquainted with Paris, and from all the signs of\r\npublic life which I saw there, I thought all that had occurred had been\r\nmerely the preliminaries of a great revolutionary movement. I had been\r\npresent at the erection of the forts detaches around Paris, which Louis\r\nPhilippe had carried out, and been instructed about the strategic value\r\nof the various fixed sentries scattered about Paris, and I agreed with\r\nthose who considered that everything was ready to make even an attempt\r\nat a rising on the part of the populace of Paris quite impossible.\r\nWhen, therefore, the Swiss War of Separation at the end of the previous\r\nyear, and the successful Sicilian Revolution at the beginning of the\r\nNew Year, turned all men’s eyes in great excitement to watch the effect\r\nof these risings on Paris, I did not take the slightest interest in the\r\nhopes and fears which were aroused. News of the growing restlessness in\r\nthe French capital did indeed reach us, but I disputed Röckel’s belief\r\nthat any significance could be attached to it. I was sitting in the\r\nconductor’s desk at a rehearsal of Martha when, during an interval,\r\nRöckel, with the peculiar joy of being in the right, brought me the\r\nnews of Louis Philippe’s flight, and the proclamation of the Republic\r\nin Paris. This made a strange and almost astonishing impression on me,\r\nalthough at the same time the doubt as to the true significance of\r\nthese events made it possible for me to smile to myself. I too caught\r\nthe fever of excitement which had spread everywhere. The German March\r\ndays were coming, and from all directions ever more alarming news kept\r\ncoming in. Even within the narrow confines of my native Saxony serious\r\npetitions were framed, which the King withstood for a long time; even\r\nhe was deceived, in a way which he was soon to acknowledge, as to the\r\nmeaning of this commotion and the temper that prevailed in the country.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of one of these really anxious days, when the very air\r\nwas heavy and full of thunder, we gave our third great orchestral\r\nconcert, at which the King and his court were present, as on the two\r\nprevious occasions. For the opening of this one I had chosen\r\nMendelssohn’s Symphony in A minor, which I had played on the occasion\r\nof his funeral. The mood of this piece, which even in the would-be\r\njoyful phrases is always tenderly melancholy, corresponded strangely\r\nwith the anxiety and depression of the whole audience, which was more\r\nparticularly accentuated in the demeanour of the royal family. I did\r\nnot conceal from Lipinsky, the leader of the orchestra, my regret at\r\nthe mistake I had made in the arrangement of that day’s programme, as\r\nBeethoven’s Fifth Symphony, also in a minor key, was to follow this\r\nminor symphony. With a merry twinkle in his eyes the eccentric Pole\r\ncomforted me by exclaiming: ‘Oh, let us play only the first two\r\nmovements of the Symphony in C minor, then no one will know whether we\r\nhave played Mendelssohn in the major or the minor key.’ Fortunately\r\nbefore these two movements began, to our great surprise, a loud shout\r\nwas raised by some patriotic spirit in the middle of the audience, who\r\ncalled out ‘Long live the King!’ and the cry was promptly repeated with\r\nunusual enthusiasm and energy on all sides. Lipinsky was perfectly\r\nright: the symphony, with the passionate and stormy excitement of the\r\nfirst theme, swelled out like a hurricane of rejoicing, and had seldom\r\nproduced such an effect on the audience as on that night. This was the\r\nlast of the newly inaugurated concerts that I ever conducted in\r\nDresden.\r\n\r\nShortly after this the inevitable political changes took place. The\r\nKing dismissed his ministry and elected a new one, consisting partly of\r\nLiberals and partly even of really enthusiastic Democrats, who at once\r\nproclaimed the well-known regulations, which are the same all over the\r\nworld, for founding a thoroughly democratic constitution. I was really\r\ntouched by this result, and by the heartfelt joy which was evident\r\namong the whole population, and I would have given much to have been\r\nable to gain access to the King, and convince myself of his hearty\r\nconfidence in the people’s love for him, which seemed to me so\r\ndesirable a consummation. In the evening the town was gaily\r\nilluminated, and the King drove through the streets in an open\r\ncarriage. In the greatest excitement I went out among the dense crowds\r\nand followed his movements, often running where I thought it likely\r\nthat a particularly hearty shout might rejoice and reconcile the\r\nmonarch’s heart. My wife was quite frightened when she saw me come back\r\nlate at night, tired out and very hoarse from shouting.\r\n\r\nThe events which took place in Vienna and Berlin, with their apparently\r\nmomentous results, only moved me as interesting newspaper reports, and\r\nthe meeting of a Frankfort parliament in the place of the dissolved\r\nBundestag sounded strangely pleasant in my ears. Yet all these\r\nsignificant occurrences could not tear me for a single day from my\r\nregular hours of work. With immense, almost overweening satisfaction, I\r\nfinished, in the last days of this eventful and historic month of\r\nMarch, the score of Lohengrin with the orchestration of the music up to\r\nthe vanishing of the Knight of the Holy Grail into the remote and\r\nmystic distance.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a young Englishwomen, Madame Jessie Laussot, who had\r\nmarried a Frenchman in Bordeaux, one day presented herself at my house\r\nin the company of Karl Ritter, who was barely eighteen years of age.\r\nThis young man, who was born in Russia of German parents, was a member\r\nof one of those northern families who had settled down permanently in\r\nDresden, on account of the pleasant artistic atmosphere of that place.\r\nI remembered that I had seen him once before not long after the first\r\nperformance of Tannhäuser, when he asked me for my autograph for a copy\r\nof the score of that opera, which was on sale at the music-shop. I now\r\nlearned that this copy really belonged to Frau Laussot, who had been\r\npresent at those performances, and who was now introduced to me.\r\nOvercome with shyness, the young lady expressed her admiration in a way\r\nI had never experienced before, and at the same time told me how great\r\nwas her regret at being called away by family affairs from her\r\nfavourite home in Dresden with the Ritter family, who, she gave me to\r\nunderstand, were deeply devoted to me. It was with a strange, and in\r\nits way quite a new, sensation that I bade farewell to this young lady.\r\nThis was the first time since my meeting with Alwine Frommann and\r\nWerder, when the Fliegender Holländer was produced, that I came across\r\nthis sympathetic tone, which seemed to come like an echo from some old\r\nfamiliar past, but which I never heard close at hand. I invited young\r\nRitter to come and see me whenever he liked, and to accompany me\r\nsometimes on my walks. His extraordinary shyness, however, seemed to\r\nprevent him from doing this, and I only remember seeing him very\r\noccasionally at my house. He used to turn up more often with Hans von\r\nBulow, whom he seemed to know pretty well, and who had already entered\r\nthe Leipzig University as a student of law. This well-informed and\r\ntalkative young man showed his warm and hearty devotion to me more\r\nopenly, and I felt bound to reciprocate his affection. He was the first\r\nperson who made me realise the genuine character of the new political\r\nenthusiasm. On his hat, as well as on his father’s, the black, red, and\r\ngold cockade was paraded before my eyes.\r\n\r\nNow that I had finished my Lohengrin, and had leisure to study the\r\ncourse of events, I could no longer help myself sympathising with the\r\nferment aroused by the birth of German ideals and the hopes attached to\r\ntheir realisation. My old friend Franck had already imbued me with a\r\nfairly sound political judgment, and, like many others, I had grave\r\ndoubts as to whether the German parliament now assembling would serve\r\nany useful purpose. Nevertheless, the temper of the populace, of which\r\nthere could be no question, although it might not have been given very\r\nobvious expression, and the belief, everywhere prevalent, that it was\r\nimpossible to return to the old conditions, could not fail to exercise\r\nits influence upon me. But I wanted actions instead of words, and\r\nactions which would force our princes to break for ever with their old\r\ntraditions, which were so detrimental to the cause of the German\r\ncommonwealth. With this object I felt inspired to write a popular\r\nappeal in verse, calling upon the German princes and peoples to\r\ninaugurate a great crusade against Russia, as the country which had\r\nbeen the prime instigator of that policy in Germany which had so\r\nfatally separated the monarchs from their subjects. One of the verses\r\nran as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe old fight against the East\r\n    Returns again to-day.\r\nThe people’s sword must not rust\r\n    Who freedom wish for aye.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I had no connection with political journals, and had learned by\r\nchance that Berthold Auerbach was on the staff of a paper in Mannheim,\r\nwhere the waves of revolution ran high, I sent him my poem with the\r\nrequest to do whatever he thought best with it, and from that day to\r\nthis I have never heard or seen anything of it.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Frankfort Parliament continued to sit on from day to day,\r\nand it seemed idle to conjecture whither this big talk by small men\r\nwould lead, I was much impressed by the news which reached us from\r\nVienna. In the May of this year an attempt at a reaction, such as had\r\nsucceeded in Naples and remained indecisive in Paris, had been\r\ntriumphantly nipped in the bud by the enthusiasm and energy of the\r\nViennese people under the leadership of the students’ band, who had\r\nacted with such unexpected firmness. I had arrived at the conclusion\r\nthat, in matters directly concerning the people, no reliance could be\r\nplaced on reason or wisdom, but only on sheer force supported by\r\nfanaticism or absolute necessity; but the course of events in Vienna,\r\nwhere I saw the youth of the educated classes working side by side with\r\nthe labouring man, filled me with peculiar enthusiasm, to which I gave\r\nexpression in another popular appeal in verse. This I sent to the\r\nOesterreichischen Zeitung, where it was printed in their columns with\r\nmy full signature.\r\n\r\nIn Dresden two political unions had been formed, as a result of the\r\ngreat changes that had taken place. The first was called the Deutscher\r\nVerein (German Union), whose programme aimed at ‘a constitutional\r\nmonarchy on the broadest democratic foundation.’ The names of its\r\nprincipal leaders, among which, in spite of its broad democratic\r\nfoundation, my friends Eduard Devrient and Professor Rietschel had the\r\ncourage openly to appear, guaranteed the safety of its objects. This\r\nunion, which tried to include every element that regarded a real\r\nrevolution with abhorrence, conjured into existence an opposition club\r\nwhich called itself the Vaterlands-Verein (Patriotic Union). In this\r\nthe ‘democratic foundation’ seemed to be the chief basis, and the\r\n‘constitutional monarchy’ only provided the necessary cloak.\r\n\r\nRöckel canvassed passionately for the latter, as he seemed to have lost\r\nall confidence in the monarchy. The poor fellow was, indeed, in a very\r\nbad way. He had long ago given up all hope of rising to any position in\r\nthe musical world; his directorship had become pure drudgery, and was,\r\nunfortunately, so badly paid that he could not possibly keep himself\r\nand his yearly increasing family on the income he derived from his\r\npost. He always had an unconquerable aversion from teaching, which was\r\na fairly profitable employment in Dresden among the many wealthy\r\nvisitors. So he went on from bad to worse, running miserably into debt,\r\nand for a long time saw no hope for his position as the father of a\r\nfamily except in emigration to America, where he thought he could\r\nsecure a livelihood for himself and his dependants by manual labour,\r\nand for his practical mind by working as a farmer, from which class he\r\nhad originally sprung. This, though tedious, would at least be certain.\r\nOn our walks he had of late been entertaining me almost exclusively\r\nwith ideas he had gleaned from reading books on farming, doctrines\r\nwhich he applied with zeal to the improvement of his encumbered\r\nposition. This was the mood in which the Revolution of 1848 found him,\r\nand he immediately went over to the extreme socialist side, which,\r\nowing to the example set by Paris, threatened to become serious. Every\r\none who knew him was utterly taken aback at the apparently vital change\r\nwhich had so suddenly taken place in him, when he declared that he had\r\nat last found his real vocation—that of an agitator.\r\n\r\nHis persuasive faculties, on which, however, he could not rely\r\nsufficiently for platform purposes, developed in private intercourse\r\ninto stupefying energy. It was impossible to stop his flow of language\r\nwith any objection, and those he could not draw over to his cause he\r\ncast aside for ever. In his enthusiasm about the problems which\r\noccupied his mind day and night, he sharpened his intellect into a\r\nweapon capable of demolishing every foolish objection, and suddenly\r\nstood in our midst like a preacher in the wilderness. He was at home in\r\nevery department of knowledge. The Vaterlands-Verein had elected a\r\ncommittee for carrying into execution a plan for arming the populace;\r\nthis included Röckel and other thoroughgoing democrats, and, in\r\naddition, certain military experts, among whom was my old friend\r\nHermann Muller, the lieutenant of the Guards who had once been engaged\r\nto Schroder-Devrient. He and another officer named Zichlinsky were the\r\nonly members of the Saxon army who joined the political movement. The\r\npart I played in the meetings of this committee, as in everything else,\r\nwas dictated by artistic motives. As far as I can remember, the details\r\nof this plan, which at last became a nuisance, afforded very sound\r\nfoundation for a genuine arming of the people, though it was impossible\r\nto carry it out during the political crisis.\r\n\r\nMy interest and enthusiasm about the social and political problems\r\nwhich were occupying the whole world increased every day, until public\r\nmeetings and private intercourse, and the shallow platitudes which\r\nformed the staple eloquence of the orators of the day, proved to me the\r\nterrible shallowness of the whole movement.\r\n\r\nIf only I could rest assured that, while such senseless confusion was\r\nthe order of the day, people well versed in these matters would\r\nwithhold from any demonstration (which to my great regret I observed in\r\nHermann Franck, and told him of, openly), then, on the contrary, I\r\nshould feel myself compelled, as soon as the opportunity arose, to\r\ndiscuss the purport of such questions and problems according to my\r\njudgment. Needless to say, the newspapers played an exciting and\r\nprominent part on this occasion. Once, when I went incidentally (as I\r\nmight go to see a play) to a meeting of the Vaterlands-Verein, when\r\nthey were assembled in a public garden, they chose for the subject of\r\ntheir discussion, ‘Republic or Monarchy?’ I was astonished to hear and\r\nto read with what incredible triviality it was carried on, and how the\r\nsum-total of their explanation was, that, to be sure, a republic is\r\nbest, but, at the worst, one could put up with a monarchy if it were\r\nwell conducted. As the result of many heated discussions on this point,\r\nI was incited to lay bare my views on the subject in an article which I\r\npublished in the DRESDENER ANZEIGER, but which I did not sign. My\r\nspecial aim was to turn the attention of the few who really took the\r\nmatter seriously, from the external form of the government to its\r\nintrinsic value. When I had pursued and consistently discussed the\r\nutmost idealistic conclusions of all that which, to my mind, was\r\nnecessary and inseparable from the perfect state and from social order,\r\nI inquired whether it would not be possible to realise all this with a\r\nking at the head, and entered so deeply into the matter as to portray\r\nthe king in such a fashion, that he seemed even more anxious than any\r\none else that his state should be organised on genuinely republican\r\nlines, in order that he might attain to the fulfilment of his own\r\nhighest aims. I must own, however, that I felt bound to urge this king\r\nto assume a much more familiar attitude towards his people than the\r\ncourt atmosphere and the almost exclusive society of his nobles would\r\nseem to render possible. Finally, I pointed to the King of Saxony as\r\nbeing specially chosen by Fate to lead the way in the direction I had\r\nindicated, and to give the example to all the other German princes.\r\nRöckel considered this article a true inspiration from the Angel of\r\nPropitiation, but as he feared that it would not meet with proper\r\nrecognition and appreciation in the paper, he urged me to lecture on it\r\npublicly at the next meeting of the Vaterlands-Verein for he attached\r\ngreat importance to my discoursing on the subject personally. Quite\r\nuncertain as to whether I could really persuade myself to do this, I\r\nattended the meeting, and there, owing to the intolerable balderdash\r\nuttered by a certain barrister named Blode and a master-furrier Klette,\r\nwhom at that time Dresden venerated as a Demosthenes and a Cleon, I\r\npassionately decided to appear at this extraordinary tribunal with my\r\npaper, and to give a very spirited reading of it to about three\r\nthousand persons.\r\n\r\nThe success I had was simply appalling. The astounded audience seemed\r\nto remember nothing of the speech of the Orchestral Conductor Royal\r\nsave the incidental attack I had made upon the court sycophants. The\r\nnews of this incredible event spread like wildfire. The next day I\r\nrehearsed Rienzi, which was to be performed the following evening. I\r\nwas congratulated on all sides upon my self-sacrificing audacity. On\r\nthe day of the performance, however, I was informed by Eisolt, the\r\nattendant of the orchestra, that the plans had been changed, and he\r\ngave me to understand that thereby there hung a tale. True enough, the\r\nterrible sensation I had made became so great, that the directors\r\nfeared the most unheard-of demonstrations at any performance of Rienzi.\r\nThen a perfect storm of derision and vituperation broke loose in the\r\npress, and I was besieged on all sides to such an extent that it was\r\nuseless to think of self-defence. I had even offended the Communal\r\nGuard of Saxony, and was challenged by the commander to make a full\r\napology. But the most inexorable enemies I made were the court\r\nofficials, especially those holding a minor office, and to this day I\r\nstill continue to be persecuted by them. I learned that, as far as it\r\nlay in their power, they incessantly besought the King, and finally the\r\ndirector, to deprive me at once of my office. On account of this I\r\nthought it necessary to write to the monarch personally, in order to\r\nexplain to him that my action was to be regarded more in the light of a\r\nthoughtless indiscretion than as a culpable offence. I sent this letter\r\nto Herr von Lüttichau, begging him to deliver it to the King, and to\r\narrange at the same time a short leave for me, so that the provoking\r\ndisturbance should have a chance of dying down during my absence from\r\nDresden. The striking kindness and goodwill which Herr von Lüttichau\r\nshowed me on this occasion made no little impression upon me, and this\r\nI took no pains to conceal from him. As in the course of time, however,\r\nhis ill-controlled rage at various things, and especially at a good\r\ndeal that he had misunderstood in my pamphlet, broke loose, I learned\r\nthat it was not from any humane motives that he had spoken in such a\r\npropitiatory manner to me, but rather by desire of the King himself. On\r\nthis point I received most accurate information, and heard that when\r\neverybody, and even von Lüttichau himself, were besieging the King to\r\nvisit me with punishment, the King had forbidden any further talk on\r\nthe subject. After this very encouraging experience, I flattered myself\r\nthat the King had understood not only my letter, but also my pamphlet,\r\nbetter than many others.\r\n\r\nIn order to change my mind a little, I determined for the present (it\r\nwas the beginning of July) to take advantage of the short period of\r\nleave granted to me, by going to Vienna. I travelled by way of Breslau,\r\nwhere I looked up an old friend of my family, the musical director\r\nMosewius, at whose house I spent an evening. We had a most lively\r\nconversation, but, unfortunately, were unable to steer clear of the\r\nstirring political questions of the day. What interested me most was\r\nhis exceptionally large, or even, if I remember rightly, complete\r\ncollection of Sebastian Bach’s cantatas in most excellent copies.\r\nBesides this, he related, with a humour quite his own, several amusing\r\nmusical anecdotes which were a pleasant memory for many a year. When\r\nMosewius returned my visit in the course of the summer at Dresden, I\r\nplayed a part of the first act of Lohengrin on the piano for him, and\r\nthe expression of his genuine astonishment at this conception was very\r\ngratifying to me. In later years, however, I found that he had spoken\r\nsomewhat scoffingly about me; but I did not stop to reflect as to the\r\ntruth of this information, or as to the real character of the man, for\r\nlittle by little I had had to accustom myself to the most inconceivable\r\nthings. At Vienna the first thing I did was to call on Professor\r\nFischhof, as I knew that he had in his keeping important manuscripts,\r\nchiefly by Beethoven, among which the original of the C minor Sonata,\r\nopus 111, I was particularly curious to see. Through this new friend,\r\nwhom I found somewhat dry, I made the acquaintance of Herr Vesque von\r\nPuttlingen, who, as the composer of a most insignificant opera (Joan of\r\nArc), which had been performed in Dresden, had with cautious good taste\r\nadopted only the last two syllables of Beethoven’s name—Haven. One day\r\nwe were at his house to dinner, and I then recognised in him a former\r\nconfidential official of Prince Metternich, who now, with his ribbon of\r\nblack, red, and gold, followed the current of the age, apparently quite\r\nconvinced. I made another interesting acquaintance in the person of\r\nHerr von Fonton, the Russian state councillor, and attache at the\r\nRussian Embassy in Vienna. I frequently met this man, both at\r\nFischhof’s house and on excursions into the surrounding country; and it\r\nwas interesting to me for the first time to run up against a man who\r\ncould so strongly profess his faith in the pessimistic standpoint, that\r\na consistent despotism guarantees the only order of things which can be\r\ntolerated. Not without interest, and certainly not without\r\nintelligence—for he boasted of having been educated at the most\r\nenlightened schools in Switzerland—he listened to my enthusiastic\r\nnarration of the art ideal which I had in my mind, and which was\r\ndestined to exercise a great and decided influence upon the human race.\r\nAs he had to allow that the realisation of this ideal could not be\r\neffected through the strength of despotism, and as he was unable to\r\nforesee any rewards for my exertions, by the time we came to the\r\nchampagne he thawed to such a degree of affable good-nature as to wish\r\nme every success. I learned later on that this man, of whose talent and\r\nenergetic character I had at the time no small opinion, was last heard\r\nof as being in great distress.\r\n\r\nNow, as I never undertook anything whatever without some serious object\r\nin view, I had made up my mind to avail myself of this visit to Vienna,\r\nin order to try in some practical manner to promote my ideas for the\r\nreform of the theatre. Vienna seemed to me specially suitable for this\r\npurpose, as at that, time it had five theatres, all totally different\r\nin character, which were dragging on a miserable existence. I quickly\r\nworked out a plan, according to which these various theatres might be\r\nformed into a sort of co-operative organisation, and placed under one\r\nadministration composed not only of active members, but also of all\r\nthose having any literary connection with the theatre. With a view to\r\nsubmitting my plan to them, I then made inquiries about persons with\r\nsuch capacities as seemed most likely to answer my requirements.\r\nBesides Herr Friedrich Uhl, whom I had got to know at the very\r\nbeginning through Fischer, and who did me very good service, I was told\r\nof a Herr Franck (the same, I presume, who later on published a big\r\nepic work called Tannhäuser), and a Dr. Pacher, an agent of\r\nMeyerbeer’s, and a pettifogger of whose acquaintance later on I was to\r\nhave no reason to be proud. The most sympathetic, and certainly the\r\nmost important, of those chosen by me for the conference meeting at\r\nFischhof’s house, was undoubtedly Dr. Becher, a passionate and\r\nexceedingly cultivated man. He was the only one present who seriously\r\nfollowed the reading of my plan, although, of course, he by no means\r\nagreed with everything. I observed in him a certain wildness and\r\nvehemence, the impression of which returned to me very vividly some\r\nmonths later, when I heard of his being shot as a rebel who had\r\nparticipated in the October Insurrection at Vienna. For the present,\r\nthen, I had to satisfy myself with having read the plan of my theatre\r\nreform to a few attentive listeners. All seemed to be convinced that\r\nthe time was not opportune for putting forward such peaceable schemes\r\nof reform. On the other hand, Uhl thought it right to give me an idea\r\nof what was at present all the rage in Vienna, by taking me one evening\r\nto a political club of the most advanced tendencies. There I heard a\r\nspeech by Herr Sigismund Englander, who shortly afterwards attracted\r\nmuch attention in the political monthly papers; the unblushing audacity\r\nwith which he and others expressed themselves that evening with regard\r\nto the most dreaded persons in public power astounded me almost as much\r\nas the poverty of the political views expressed on that occasion. By\r\nway of contrast I received a very nice impression of Herr Grillparzer,\r\nthe poet, whose name was like a fable to me, associated as it was, from\r\nmy earliest days, with his Ahnfrau. I approached him also with respect\r\nto the matter of my theatre reform. He seemed quite disposed to listen\r\nin a friendly manner to what I had to say to him; he did not, however,\r\nattempt to conceal his surprise at my direct appeals and the personal\r\ndemands I made of him. He was the first playwright I had ever seen in\r\nan official uniform.\r\n\r\nAfter I had paid an unsuccessful visit to Herr Bauernfeld, relative to\r\nthe same business, I concluded that Vienna was of no more use for the\r\npresent, and gave myself up to the exceptionally stimulating\r\nimpressions produced by the public life of the motley crowd, which of\r\nlate had undergone such marked changes. If the student band, which was\r\nalways represented in great numbers in the streets, had already amused\r\nme with the extraordinary constancy with which its members sported the\r\nGerman colours, I was very highly diverted by the effect produced when\r\nat the theatres I saw even the ices served by attendants in the black,\r\nred, and gold of Austria. At the Karl Theatre, in the Leopold quarter\r\nof the town, I saw a new farce, by Nestroy, which actually introduced\r\nthe character of Prince Metternich, and in which this statesman, on\r\nbeing asked whether he had poisoned the Duke of Reichstadt, had to make\r\nhis escape behind the wings as an unmasked sinner. On the whole, the\r\nappearance of this imperial city—usually so fond of pleasure—impressed\r\none with a feeling of youthful and powerful confidence. And this\r\nimpression was revived in me when I heard of the energetic\r\nparticipation of the youthful members of the population, during those\r\nfateful October days, in the defence of Vienna against the troops of\r\nPrince Windischgratz.\r\n\r\nOn the homeward journey I touched at Prague, where I found my old\r\nfriend Kittl (who had grown very much more corpulent) still in the most\r\nterrible fright about the riotous events which had taken place there.\r\nHe seemed to be of opinion that the revolt of the Tschech party against\r\nthe Austrian Government was directed at him personally, and he thought\r\nfit to reproach himself with the terrible agitation of the time, which\r\nhe believed he had specially inflamed by his composition of my operatic\r\ntext of Die Franzosen vor Nizza, out of which a kind of revolutionary\r\nair seemed to have become very popular. To my great pleasure, on my\r\nhomeward journey I had the company of Hänel the sculptor, whom I met on\r\nthe steamer. There travelled with us also a Count Albert Nostitz, with\r\nwhom he had just settled up his business concerning the statue of the\r\nEmperor Charles IV., and he was in the gayest mood, as the extremely\r\ninsecure state of Austrian paper money had led to his being paid at a\r\ngreat profit to himself, in silver coin in accordance with his\r\nagreement. I was very pleased to find that, thanks to this\r\ncircumstance, he was in such a confident mood, and so free from\r\nprejudice, that on, arriving at Dresden he accompanied me the whole\r\nway—a very long distance—from the landing-stage at which we had left\r\nthe steamer to my house, in an open carriage; and this despite the fact\r\nthat he very well knew that, only a few weeks before, I had caused a\r\nreally terrible stir in this very city.\r\n\r\nAs far as the public were concerned, the storm seemed quite to have\r\ndied down, and I was able to resume my usual occupations and mode of\r\nlife without any further trouble. I am sorry to say, however, that my\r\nold worries and anxieties started afresh; I stood in great need of\r\nmoney, and had not the vaguest notion whither to go in search of it. I\r\nthen examined very thoroughly the answer I had received during the\r\npreceding winter to my petition for a higher salary. I had left it\r\nunread, as the modifications made in it had already disgusted me. If I\r\nhad till now believed that it was Herr von Lüttichau who had brought\r\nabout the increase of salary I had demanded, in the shape of a\r\nsupplement which I was to receive annually—in itself a humiliating\r\nthing—I now saw to my horror that all the time there had been no\r\nmention save of one single supplement, and that there was nothing to\r\nshow that this should be repeated annually. On learning this, I saw\r\nthat I should now be at the hopeless disadvantage of coming too late\r\nwith a remonstrance if I should attempt to make one; so there was\r\nnothing left for me but to submit to an insult which, under the\r\ncircumstances, was quite unprecedented. My feelings towards Herr von\r\nLüttichau, which shortly before had been rather warm owing to his\r\nsupposed kind attitude towards me during the last disturbance, now\r\nunderwent a serious change, and I soon had a new reason (actually\r\nconnected with the above-mentioned affair) for altering my favourable\r\nopinion of him, and for turning finally against him for good and all.\r\nHe had informed me that the members of the Imperial Orchestra had sent\r\nhim a deputation demanding my instant dismissal, as they thought that\r\nit affected their honour to be any longer under a conductor who had\r\ncompromised himself politically to the extent which I had. He also\r\ninformed me that he had not only reprimanded them very severely, but\r\nthat he had also been at great pains to pacify them concerning me. All\r\nthis, which Lüttichau had put in a highly favourable light, had\r\nlatterly made me feel very friendly towards him. Then, however, as the\r\nresult of inquiries into the matter, I heard accidentally through\r\nmembers of the orchestra that the facts of the case were almost exactly\r\nthe reverse. What had happened was this, that the members of the\r\nImperial Orchestra had been approached on all sides by the officials of\r\nthe court, and had been not only earnestly requested to do what\r\nLüttichau had declared they had done of their own accord, but also\r\nthreatened with the displeasure of the King, and of incurring the\r\nstrongest suspicion if they refused to comply. In order to protect\r\nthemselves against this intrigue, and to avoid all evil consequences\r\nshould they not take the required step, the musicians had turned to\r\ntheir principal, and had sent him a deputation, through which they\r\ndeclared that, as a corporation of artists, they did not in the least\r\nfeel called upon to mix themselves up in a matter that did not concern\r\nthem. Thus the halo with which my former attachment to Herr von\r\nLüttichau had surrounded him at last disappeared for good and all, and\r\nit was chiefly my shame at having been so very much upset by his false\r\nconduct that now inspired me for ever with such bitter feelings for\r\nthis man. What determined this feeling even more than the insults I had\r\nsuffered, was the recognition of the fact that I was now utterly\r\nincapable of ever being able to enlist his influence in the cause of\r\ntheatrical reform, which was so dear to me. It was natural that I\r\nshould learn to attach ever less and less importance to the mere\r\nretention of the post of orchestral conductor on so extraordinarily\r\ninadequate and reduced a salary; and in keeping to this office, I\r\nmerely bowed to what was an inevitable though purely accidental\r\ncircumstance of a wretched fate. I did nothing to make the post more\r\nintolerable, but, at the same time, I moved not a finger to ensure its\r\npermanence.\r\n\r\nThe very next thing I must do was to attempt to establish my hopes of a\r\nlarger income, so sadly doomed hitherto, upon a very much sounder\r\nbasis. In this respect it occurred to me that I might consult my friend\r\nLiszt, and beg him to suggest a remedy for my grievous position. And lo\r\nand behold, shortly after those fateful March days, and not long before\r\nthe completion of my Lohengrin score, to my very great delight and\r\nastonishment, the very man I wanted walked into my room. He had come\r\nfrom Vienna, where he had lived through the ‘Barricade Days,’ and he\r\nwas going on to Weimar, where he intended to settle permanently. We\r\nspent an evening together at Schumann’s, had a little music, and\r\nfinally began a discussion on Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer, in which Liszt\r\nand Schumann differed so fundamentally that the latter, completely\r\nlosing his temper, retired in a fury to his bedroom for quite a long\r\ntime. This incident did indeed place us in a somewhat awkward position\r\ntowards our host, but it furnished us with a most amusing topic of\r\nconversation on the way home, I have seldom seen Liszt so extravagantly\r\ncheerful as on that night, when, in spite of the cold and the fact that\r\nhe was clad only in ordinary evening-dress, he accompanied first the\r\nmusic director Schubert, and then myself, to our respective homes.\r\nSubsequently I took advantage of a few days’ holiday in August to make\r\nan excursion to Weimar, where I found Liszt permanently installed and,\r\nas is well known, enjoying a life of most intimate intercourse with the\r\nGrand Duke. Even though he was unable to help me in my affairs, except\r\nby giving me a recommendation which finally proved useless, his\r\nreception of me on this short visit was so hearty and so exceedingly\r\nstimulating, that it left me profoundly cheered and encouraged. On\r\nreturning to Dresden I tried as far as possible to curtail my expenses\r\nand to live within my means; and, as every means of assistance failed\r\nme, I resorted to the expedient of sending out a circular letter\r\naddressed jointly to my remaining creditors, all of whom were really\r\nfriends; and in this I told them frankly of my situation, and enjoined\r\nthem to relinquish their demands for an indefinite time, till my\r\naffairs took a turn for the better, as without this I should certainly\r\nnever be in a position to satisfy them. By this means they would, at\r\nall events, be in a position to oppose my general manager, whom I had\r\nevery reason to suspect of evil designs, and who would have been only\r\ntoo glad to seize any signs of hostility towards me, on the part of my\r\ncreditors, as a pretext for taking the worst steps against me. The\r\nassurance I required was given me unhesitatingly; my friend Pusinelli,\r\nand Frau Klepperbein (an old friend of my mother’s), even going so far\r\nas to declare that they were prepared to give up all claim to the money\r\nthey had lent me. Thus, in some measure reassured, and with my position\r\nrelative to Lüttichau so far improved that I could consult my own\r\nwishes as to whether and when I should give up my post entirely, I now\r\ncontinued to fulfil my duties as a conductor as patiently and\r\nconscientiously as I was able, while with great zeal I also resumed my\r\nstudies, which were carrying me ever further and further afield.\r\n\r\nThus settled, I now began to watch the wonderful developments in the\r\nfate of my friend Röckel. As every day brought fresh rumours of\r\nthreatened reactionary coups d’etat and similar violent outbreaks,\r\nwhich Röckel thought it right to prevent, he drew up an appeal to the\r\nsoldiers of the army of Saxony, in which he explained every detail of\r\nthe cause for which he stood, and which he then had printed and\r\ndistributed broadcast. This was too flagrant a misdeed for the public\r\nprosecutors: he was therefore immediately placed under arrest, and had\r\nto remain three days in gaol while an action for high treason was\r\nlodged against him. He was only released when the solicitor Minkwitz\r\nstood bail for the requisite three thousand marks (equal to L150). This\r\nreturn home to his anxious wife and children was celebrated by a little\r\npublic festival, which the committee of the Vaterlands-Verein had\r\narranged in his honour, and the liberated man was greeted as the\r\nchampion of the people’s cause. On the other hand, however, the general\r\nmanagement of the court theatre, who had before suspended him\r\ntemporarily, now gave him his final dismissal. Röckel let a full beard\r\ngrow, and began the publication of a popular journal called the\r\nVolksblatt, of which he was sole editor. He must have counted on its\r\nsuccess to compensate him for the loss of his salary as musical\r\ndirector, for he at once hired an office in the Brudergasse for his\r\nundertaking. This paper succeeded in attracting the attention of a\r\ngreat many people to its editor, and showed up his talents in quite a\r\nnew light, he never got involved in his style or indulged in any\r\nelaboration of words, but confined himself to matters of immediate\r\nimportance and general interest; it was only after having discussed\r\nthem in a calm and sober fashion, that he led up from them to further\r\ndeductions of still greater interest connected with them. The\r\nindividual articles were short, and never contained anything\r\nsuperfluous, in addition to which they were so clearly written, that\r\nthey made an instructive and convincing appeal to the most uneducated\r\nmind. By always going to the root of things, instead of indulging in\r\ncircumlocutions which, in politics, have caused such great confusion in\r\nthe minds of the uneducated masses, he soon had a large circle of\r\nreaders, both among cultivated and uncultivated people. The only\r\ndrawback was that the price of the little weekly paper was too small to\r\nyield him a corresponding profit. Moreover, it was necessary to warn\r\nhim that if the reactionary party should ever come into power again, it\r\ncould never possibly forgive him for this newspaper. His younger\r\nbrother, Edward, who was paying a visit at the time in Dresden,\r\ndeclared himself willing to accept a post as piano-teacher in England,\r\nwhich, though most uncongenial to him, would be lucrative and place him\r\nin a position to help Röckel’s family, if, as seemed probable, he met\r\nhis reward in prison or on the gallows. Owing to his connection with\r\nvarious societies, his time was so much taken up that my intercourse\r\nwith him was limited to walks, which became more and more rare. On\r\nthese occasions I often got lost in the most wildly speculative and\r\nprofound discussions, while this wonderfully exciteable man always\r\nremained calmly reflective and clear-headed. First and foremost, he had\r\nplanned a drastic social reform of the middle classes—as at present\r\nconstituted—by aiming at a complete alteration of the basis of their\r\ncondition. He constructed a totally new moral order of things, founded\r\non the teaching of Proudhon and other socialists regarding the\r\nannihilation of the power of capital, by immediately productive labour,\r\ndispensing with the middleman. Little by little he converted me, by\r\nmost seductive arguments, to his own views, to such an extent that I\r\nbegan to rebuild my hopes for the realisation of my ideal in art upon\r\nthem. Thus there were two questions which concerned me very nearly: he\r\nwished to abolish matrimony, in the usual acceptation of the word,\r\naltogether. I thereupon asked him what he thought the result would be\r\nof promiscuous intercourse with women of a doubtful character. With\r\namiable indignation he gave me to understand that we could have no idea\r\nabout the purity of morals in general, and of the relations of the\r\nsexes in particular, so long as we were unable to free people\r\ncompletely from the yoke of the trades, guilds, and similar coercive\r\ninstitutions. He asked me to consider what the only motive would be\r\nwhich would induce a woman to surrender herself to a man, when not only\r\nthe considerations of money, fortune, position, and family prejudices,\r\nbut also the various influences necessarily arising from these, had\r\ndisappeared. When I, in my turn, asked him whence he would obtain\r\npersons of great intellect and of artistic ability, if everybody were\r\nto be merged in the working classes, he met my objection by replying,\r\nthat owing to the very fact that everybody would participate in the\r\nnecessary labour according to his strength and capacity, work would\r\ncease to be a burden, and would become simply an occupation which would\r\nfinally assume an entirely artistic character. He demonstrated this on\r\nthe principle that, as had already been proved, a field, worked\r\nlaboriously by a single peasant, was infinitely less productive than\r\nwhen cultivated by several persons in a scientific way. These and\r\nsimilar suggestions, which Röckel communicated to me with a really\r\ndelightful enthusiasm, led me to further reflections, and gave birth to\r\nnew plans upon which, to my mind, a possible organisation of the human\r\nrace, which would correspond to my highest ideals in art, could alone\r\nbe based. In reference to this, I immediately turned my thoughts to\r\nwhat was close at hand, and directed my attention to the theatre. The\r\nmotive for this came not only from my own feelings, but also from\r\nexternal circumstances. In accordance with the latest democratic\r\nsuffrage laws, a general election seemed imminent in Saxony; the\r\nelection of extreme radicals, which had now taken place nearly\r\neverywhere else, showed us that if the movement lasted, there would be\r\nthe most extraordinary changes even in the administration of the\r\nrevenue. Apparently a general resolution had been passed to subject the\r\nCivil List to a strict revision; all that was deemed superfluous in the\r\nroyal household was to be done away with; the theatre, as an\r\nunnecessary place of entertainment for a depraved portion of the\r\npublic, was threatened with the withdrawal of the subsidy granted it\r\nfrom the Civil List. I now resolved, in view of the importance which I\r\nattached to the theatre, to suggest to the ministers that they should\r\ninform the members of parliament, that if the theatre in its present\r\ncondition were not worth any sacrifice from the state, it would sink to\r\nstill more doubtful tendencies—and might even become dangerous to\r\npublic morals—if deprived of that state control which had for its aim\r\nthe ideal, and, at the same time, felt itself called upon to place\r\nculture and education under its beneficial protection. It was of the\r\nhighest importance to me to secure an organisation of the theatre,\r\nwhich would make the carrying out its loftiest ideals not only a\r\npossibility but also a certainty. Accordingly I drew up a project by\r\nwhich the same sum as that which was allotted from the Civil List for\r\nthe support of a court theatre should be employed for the foundation\r\nand upkeep of a national theatre for the kingdom of Saxony. In showing\r\nthe practical nature of the well-planned particulars of my scheme, I\r\ndefined them with such great precision, that I felt assured my work\r\nwould serve as a useful guide to the ministers as to how they should\r\nput this matter before parliament. The point now was to have a personal\r\ninterview with one of the ministers, and it occurred to me that the\r\nbest man to apply to in the matter would be Herr von der Pfordten, the\r\nMinister of Education. Although he already enjoyed the reputation of\r\nbeing a turncoat in politics, and was said to be struggling to efface\r\nthe origin of his political promotion, which had taken place at a time\r\nof great agitation, the mere fact of his having formerly been a\r\nprofessor was sufficient to make me suppose that he was a man with whom\r\nI could discuss the question that I had so much at heart. I learned,\r\nhowever, that the real art institutions of the kingdom, such, for\r\ninstance, as the Academy of Fine Arts, to whose number I so ardently\r\ndesired to see the theatre added, belonged to the department of the\r\nMinister of the Interior. To this man—the worthy though not highly\r\ncultivated or artistic Herr Oberlander—I submitted my plans, not,\r\nhowever, without having first made myself known to Herr von der\r\nPfordten, in order, for the reasons above stated, to command my project\r\nto him. This man, who apparently was very busy, received me in a polite\r\nand reassuring manner; but his whole bearing, indeed the very\r\nexpression of his face, seemed to destroy all hopes I might ever have\r\ncherished of finding in him that understanding which I had expected.\r\nThe minister Oberlander, on the other hand, earned my confidence by the\r\nstraightforward earnestness with which he promised a thorough inquiry\r\ninto the matter. Unfortunately, however, at the same time, he informed\r\nme with the most simple frankness, that he could entertain but very\r\nlittle hope of getting the King’s authorisation for any unusual\r\ntreatment of a question hitherto given over to routine. It must be\r\nunderstood that the relations of the King to his ministers were both\r\nstrained and unconfidential, and that this was more especially so in\r\nthe case of Oberlander, who never approached the monarch on any other\r\nbusiness than that which the strictest discharge of his current duties\r\nrendered indispensable. He therefore thought it would be better if my\r\nplan could be brought forward, in the first place, by the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. As, in the event of the new Civil List being discussed, I was\r\nparticularly anxious to avoid the question of the continuation of the\r\ncourt theatre being treated in the ignorant and shortsighted radical\r\nfashion, which was to be feared above all, I did not despair of making\r\nthe acquaintance of some of the most influential among the new members\r\nof parliament. In this wise I found myself suddenly plunged into quite\r\na new and strange world, and became acquainted with persons and\r\nopinions, the very existence of which until then I had not even\r\nsuspected. I found it somewhat trying always to be obliged to meet\r\nthese gentlemen at their beer and shrouded in the dense clouds of their\r\ntobacco smoke, and to have to discuss with them matters which, though\r\nvery dear to me, must have seemed a little fantastic to their mind.\r\nAfter a certain Herr von Trutschler, a very handsome, energetic man,\r\nwhose seriousness was almost gloomy, had listened to me calmly for some\r\ntime, and had told me that he no longer knew anything about the state,\r\nbut only about society, and that the latter would know, without either\r\nhis or my aid, how it should act in regard to art and to the theatre, I\r\nwas filled with such extraordinary feelings, half mingled with shame,\r\nthat there and then I gave up, not only all my exertions, but all my\r\nhopes as well. The only reminder I ever had of the whole affair came\r\nsome while, after when, on meeting Herr von Lüttichau, I quickly\r\ngathered from his attitude to me that he had got wind of the episode,\r\nand that it only inspired him with fresh hostility towards me.\r\n\r\nDuring my walks, which I now took absolutely alone, I thought ever more\r\ndeeply—and much to the relief of my mind—over my ideas concerning that\r\nstate of human society for which the boldest hopes and efforts of the\r\nsocialists and communists, then busily engaged in constructing their\r\nsystem, offered me but the roughest foundation. These efforts could\r\nbegin to have some meaning and value for me only when they had attained\r\nto that political revolution and reconstruction which they aimed at;\r\nfor it was only then that I, in my turn, could start my reforms in art.\r\n\r\nAt the same time my thoughts were busy with a drama, in which the\r\nEmperor Frederick I. (surnamed ‘Barbarossa’) was to be the hero. In it\r\nthe model ruler was portrayed in a manner which lent him the greatest\r\nand most powerful significance. His dignified resignation at the\r\nimpossibility of making his ideals prevail was intended not only to\r\npresent a true transcript of the arbitrary multifariousness of the\r\nthings of this world, but also to arouse sympathy for the hero. I\r\nwished to carry out this drama in popular rhyme, and in the style of\r\nthe German used by our epic poets of the Middle Ages, and in this\r\nrespect the poem Alexander, by the priest Lambert, struck me as a good\r\nexample; but I never got further with this play than to sketch its\r\noutline in the broadest manner possible. The five acts were planned in\r\nthe following manner: Act i. Imperial Diet in the Roncaglian fields, a\r\ndemonstration of the significance of imperial power which should extend\r\neven to the investiture of water and air; Act ii. the siege and capture\r\nof Milan; Act iii. revolt of Henry the Lion and his overthrow at\r\nLigano; Act iv. Imperial Diet in Augsburg, the humiliation and\r\npunishment of Henry the Lion; Act v. Imperial Diet and grand court\r\nassembly at Mainz; peace with the Lombards, reconciliation with the\r\nPope, acceptance of the Cross, and the departure for the East. I lost\r\nall interest, however, in the carrying out of this dramatic scheme\r\ndirectly I discovered its resemblance to the subject-matter of the\r\nNibelungen and Siegfried myths, which possessed a more powerful\r\nattraction for me. The points of similarity which I recognised between\r\nthe history and the legend in question then induced me to write a\r\ntreatise on the subject; and in this I was assisted by some stimulating\r\nmonographs (found in the royal library), written by authors whose names\r\nhave now escaped my memory, but which taught me in a very attractive\r\nmanner a considerable amount about the old original kingdom of Germany.\r\nLater on I published this fairly extensive essay with the title of Die\r\nNibelungen, but in working it out I finally lost all inclination to\r\nelaborate the historical material for a real drama.\r\n\r\nIn direct connection with this I began to sketch a clear summary of the\r\nform which the old original Nibelungen myth had assumed in my mind in\r\nits immediate association with the mythological legend of the gods—a\r\nform which, though full of detail, was yet much condensed in its\r\nleading features. Thanks to this work, I was able to convert the chief\r\npart of the material itself into a musical drama. It was only by\r\ndegrees, however, and after long hesitation that I dared to enter more\r\ndeeply into my plans for this work; for the thought of the practical\r\nrealisation of such a work on our stage literally appalled me. I must\r\nconfess that it required all the despair which I then felt of ever\r\nhaving the chance of doing anything more for our theatre, to give me\r\nthe necessary courage to begin upon this new work. Until that time I\r\nsimply allowed myself to drift, while I meditated listlessly upon the\r\npossibility of things pursuing their course further under the existing\r\ncircumstances. In regard to Lohengrin, I had got to that point when I\r\nhoped for nothing more than the best possible production of it at the\r\nDresden theatre, and felt that I should have to be satisfied in all\r\nrespects, and for all time, if I were able to achieve even that. I had\r\nduly announced the completion of the score to Herr von Lüttichau; but,\r\nin consideration of the unfavourable nature of my circumstances at the\r\ntime, I had left it entirely to him to decide when my work should be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the time arrived when the keeper of the Archives of the Royal\r\nOrchestra called to mind that it was just three hundred years since\r\nthis royal institution had been founded, and that a jubilee would\r\ntherefore have to be celebrated. To this end a great concert festival\r\nwas planned, the programme of which was to be made up of the\r\ncompositions of all the Saxon orchestral conductors that had lived\r\nsince the institution had been founded. The whole body of musicians,\r\nwith both their conductors at their head, were first to present their\r\ngrateful homage to the King in Pillnitz; and on this occasion a\r\nmusician was, for the first time, to be elevated to the rank of Knight\r\nof the Civil Order of Merit of Saxony. This musician was my colleague\r\nReissiger. Until then he had been treated by the court, and by the\r\nmanager himself, in the most scornful manner possible, but had, owing\r\nto his conspicuous loyalty at this critical time, especially to me,\r\nfound exceptional favour in the eyes of our committees. When he\r\nappeared before the public decorated with the wonderful order, he was\r\ngreeted with great jubilation by the loyal audience that filled the\r\ntheatre on the evening of the festival concert. His overture to Yelva\r\nwas also received with a perfect uproar of enthusiastic applause, such\r\nas had never fallen to his lot; whereas the finale of the first act\r\nfrom Lohengrin, which was produced as the work of the youngest\r\nconductor, was accorded only an indifferent reception. This was all the\r\nmore strange as I was quite unaccustomed to such coolness in regard to\r\nmy work on the part of the Dresden public. Following upon the concert,\r\nthere was a festive supper, and when this was over, as all kinds of\r\nspeeches were being made, I freely proclaimed to the orchestra, in a\r\nloud and decided tone, my views as to what was desirable for their\r\nperfection in the future. Hereupon Marschner, who, as a former musical\r\nconductor in Dresden, had been invited to the jubilee celebrations,\r\nexpressed the opinion that I should do myself a great deal of harm by\r\nholding too good an opinion of the musicians. He said I ought just to\r\nconsider how uncultivated these people were with whom I had to deal; he\r\npointed out that they were trained simply for the one instrument they\r\nplayed; and asked me whether I did not think that by discoursing to\r\nthem on the aspirations of art I would produce not only confusion, but\r\neven perhaps bad blood? Far more pleasant to me than these festivities\r\nis the remembrance of the quiet memorial ceremony which united us on\r\nthe morning of the Jubilee Day, with the object of placing wreaths on\r\nWeber’s grave. As nobody could find a word to utter, and even Marschner\r\nwas able to give expression only to the very driest and most trivial of\r\nspeeches about the departed master, I felt it incumbent upon me to say\r\na few heartfelt words concerning the memorial ceremony for which we\r\nwere gathered together. This brief spell of artistic activity was\r\nspeedily broken by fresh excitements, which kept pouring in upon us\r\nfrom the political world. The events of October in Vienna awakened our\r\nliveliest sympathy, and our walls daily blazed with red and black\r\nplacards, with summonses to march on Vienna, with the curse of ‘Red\r\nMonarchy,’ as opposed to the hated ‘Red Republic,’ and with other\r\nequally startling matter. Except for those who were best informed as to\r\nthe course of events—and who certainly did not swarm in our\r\nstreets—these occurrences aroused great uneasiness everywhere. With the\r\nentry of Windischgratz into Vienna, the acquittal of Frobel and the\r\nexecution of Blum, it seemed as though even Dresden were on the eve of\r\nan explosion. A vast demonstration of mourning was organised for Blum,\r\nwith an endless procession through the streets. At the head marched the\r\nministry, among whom the people were particularly glad to see Herr von\r\nder Pfordten taking a sympathetic share in the ceremony, as he had\r\nalready become an object of suspicion to them. From that day gloomy\r\nforebodings of disaster grew ever more prevalent on every side. People\r\neven went so far as to say, with little attempt at circumlocution, that\r\nthe execution of Blum had been an act of friendship on the part of the\r\nArchduchess Sophia to her sister, the Queen of Saxony, for during his\r\nagitation in Leipzig the man had made himself both hated and feared.\r\nTroops of Viennese fugitives, disguised as members of the student\r\nbands, began to arrive in Dresden, and made a formidable addition to\r\nits population, which from this time forth paraded the streets with\r\never-increasing confidence. One day, as I was on my way to the theatre\r\nto conduct a performance of Rienzi, the choir-master informed me that\r\nseveral foreign gentlemen had been asking for me. Thereupon half a\r\ndozen persons presented themselves, greeted me as a brother democrat,\r\nand begged me to procure them free entrance tickets. Among them I\r\nrecognised a former dabbler in literature, a man named Hafner, a little\r\nhunchback, in a Calabrian hat cocked at a terrific angle, to whom I had\r\nbeen introduced by Uhl on the occasion of my visit to the Vienna\r\npolitical club. Great as was my embarrassment at this visit, which\r\nevidently astonished our musicians, I felt in no wise compelled to make\r\nany compromising admission, but quietly went to the booking-office,\r\ntook six tickets and handed them to my strange visitors, who parted\r\nfrom me before all the world with much hearty shaking of hands. Whether\r\nthis evening call improved my position as musical conductor in Dresden\r\nin the minds of the theatrical officials and others, may well be\r\ndoubted; but, at all events, on no occasion was I so frantically called\r\nfor after every act as at this particular performance of Rienzi.\r\n\r\nIndeed, at this time I seemed to have won over to my side a party of\r\nalmost passionate adherents among the theatre-going public, in\r\nopposition to the clique which had shown such marked coldness on the\r\noccasion of the gala concert already mentioned. It mattered not whether\r\nTannhäuser or Rienzi were being played, I was always greeted with\r\nspecial applause; and although the political tendencies of this party\r\nmay have given our management some cause for alarm, yet it forced them\r\nto regard me with a certain amount of awe. One day Lüttichau proposed\r\nto have my Lohengrin performed at an early date. I explained my reasons\r\nfor not having offered it to him before, but declared myself ready to\r\nfurther his wishes, as I considered the opera company was now\r\nsufficiently powerful. The son of my old friend, F. Heine, had just\r\nreturned from Paris, where he had been sent by the Dresden management\r\nto study scene-painting under the artists Desplechin and Dieterle. By\r\nway of testing his powers, with a view to an engagement at the Dresden\r\nRoyal Theatre, the task of preparing suitable scenery for this opera\r\nwas entrusted to him. He had already asked permission to do this for\r\nLohengrin at the instigation of Lüttichau, who wished to call attention\r\nto my latest work. Consequently, when I gave my consent, young Heine’s\r\nwish was granted.\r\n\r\nI regarded this turn of events with no little satisfaction, believing\r\nthat in the study of this particular work I should find a wholesome and\r\neffective diversion from all the excitement and confusion of recent\r\nevents. My horror, therefore, was all the greater, when young Wilhelm\r\nHeine one day came to my room with the news that the scenery for\r\nLohengrin had been suddenly countermanded, and instructions given him\r\nto prepare for another opera. I did not make any remark, nor ask the\r\nreason for this singular behaviour. The assurances which Luttichan\r\nafterwards made to my wife—if they were really true—made me regret\r\nhaving laid the chief blame for this mortification at his door, and\r\nhaving thereby irrevocably alienated my sympathy from him. When she\r\nasked him about this many years later, he assured her that he had found\r\nthe court vehemently hostile to me, and that his well-meant attempts to\r\nproduce my work had met with insuperable obstacles.\r\n\r\nHowever that may have been, the bitterness I now experienced wrought a\r\ndecisive effect upon my feelings. Not only did I relinquish all hope of\r\na reconciliation with the theatre authorities by a splendid production\r\nof my Lohengrin, but I determined to turn my back for ever on the\r\ntheatre, and to make no further attempt to meddle with its concerns. By\r\nthis act I expressed not merely my utter indifference as to whether I\r\nkept my position as musical conductor or no, but my artistic ambitions\r\nalso entirely cut me off from all possibility of ever cultivating\r\nmodern theatrical conditions again.\r\n\r\nI at once proceeded to execute my long-cherished plans for Siegfried’s\r\nTod, which I had been half afraid of before. In this work I no longer\r\ngave a thought to the Dresden or any other court theatre in the world;\r\nmy sole preoccupation was to produce something that should free me,\r\nonce and for all, from this irrational subservience. As I could get\r\nnothing more from Röckel in this connection, I now corresponded\r\nexclusively with Eduard Devrient on matters connected with the theatre\r\nand dramatic art. When, on the completion of my poem, I read it to him,\r\nhe listened with amazement, and at once realised the fact that such a\r\nproduction would be an absolute drug in the modern theatrical market,\r\nand he naturally could not agree to let it remain so. On the other\r\nhand, he tried so far to reconcile himself to my work as to try and\r\nmake it less startling and more adapted for actual production. He\r\nproved the sincerity of his intentions by pointing out my error in\r\nasking too much of the public, and requiring it to supply from its own\r\nknowledge many things necessary for a right under-standing of my\r\nsubject-matter, at which I had only hinted in brief and scattered\r\nsuggestions. He showed me, for instance, that before Siegfried and\r\nBrunhilda are displayed in a position of bitter hostility towards each\r\nother, they ought first to have been presented in their true and calmer\r\nrelationship. I had, in fact, opened the poem of SIEGFRIED’S TOD with\r\nthose scenes which now form the first act of the GOTTERDAMMERUNG. The\r\ndetails of Siegfried’s relation to Brunhilda had been merely outlined\r\nto the listeners in a lyrico-episodical dialogue between the hero’s\r\nwife, whom he had left behind in solitude, and a crowd of Valkyries\r\npassing before her rock. To my great joy, Devrient’s hint on this point\r\ndirected my thoughts to those scenes which I afterwards worked out in\r\nthe prologue of this drama.\r\n\r\nThis and other matters of a similar nature brought me into intimate\r\ncontact with Eduard Devrient, and made our intercourse much more lively\r\nand pleasant. He often invited a select circle of friends to attend\r\ndramatic readings at his house in which I gladly took part, for I\r\nfound, to my surprise, that his gift for declamation, which quite\r\nforsook him on the stage, here stood out in strong relief. It was,\r\nmoreover, a consolation to pour into a sympathetic ear my worries about\r\nmy growing unpopularity with the director. Devrient seemed particularly\r\nanxious to prevent a definite breach; but of this there was little\r\nhope. With the approach of winter the court had returned to town, and\r\nonce more frequented the theatre, and various signs of dissatisfaction\r\nin high quarters with my behaviour as conductor began to be manifested.\r\nOn one occasion the Queen thought that I had conducted NORMA badly, and\r\non another that I ‘had taken the time wrongly’ in ROBERT THE DEVIL. As\r\nLuettichau had to communicate these reprimands to me, it was natural\r\nthat our intercourse at such times should hardly be of a nature to\r\nrestore our mutual satisfaction with each other.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, it still seemed possible to prevent matters\r\nfrom coming to a crisis, though everything continued in a state of\r\nagitating uncertainty and fermentation. At all events the forces of\r\nreaction, which were holding themselves in readiness on every side,\r\nwere not yet sufficiently certain that the hour of their triumph had\r\ncome as not to consider it advisable for the present, at least, to\r\navoid all provocation. Consequently our management did not meddle with\r\nthe musicians of the royal orchestra, who, in obedience to the spirit\r\nof the times, had formed a union for debate and the protection of their\r\nartistic and civic interests. In this matter one of our youngest\r\nmusicians, Theodor Uhlig, had been particularly active. He was a young\r\nman, still in his early twenties, and was a violinist in the orchestra.\r\nHis face was strikingly mild, intelligent and noble, and he was\r\nconspicuous among his fellows on account of his great seriousness and\r\nhis quiet but unusually firm character. He had particularly attracted\r\nmy notice on several occasions by his quick insight and extensive\r\nknowledge of music. As I recognised in him a spirit keenly alert in\r\nevery direction, and unusually eager for culture, it was not long\r\nbefore I chose him as my companion in my regular walks—a habit I still\r\ncontinued to cultivate—and on which Roeckel had hitherto accompanied\r\nme. He induced me to come to a meeting of this union of the orchestral\r\ncompany, in order that I might form an opinion about it, and encourage\r\nand support so praiseworthy a movement. On this occasion I communicated\r\nto its members the contents of my memorandum to the director, which had\r\nbeen rejected a year before, and in which I had made suggestions for\r\nreforms in the band, and I also explained further intentions and plans\r\narising therefrom. At the same time I was obliged to confess that I had\r\nlost all hope of carrying out any projects of the kind through the\r\ngeneral management, and must therefore recommend them to take the\r\ninitiative vigorously into their own hands. They acclaimed the idea\r\nwith enthusiastic approval. Although, as I have said before, Luettichau\r\nleft these musicians unmolested in their more or less democratic union,\r\nyet he took care to be informed through spies of what took place at\r\ntheir highly treasonable gatherings. His chief instrument was a bugler\r\nnamed Lewy, who, much to the disgust of all his comrades in the\r\norchestra, was in particularly high favour with the director. He\r\nconsequently received precise, or rather exaggerated, accounts of my\r\nappearance there, and thought it was now high time to let me once more\r\nfeel the weight of his authority. I was officially summoned to his\r\npresence, and had to listen to a long and wrathful tirade which he had\r\nbeen bottling up for some time about several matters. I also learned\r\nthat he knew all about the plan of theatre reform which I had laid\r\nbefore the ministry. This knowledge he betrayed in a popular Dresden\r\nphrase, which until then I had never heard; he knew very well, he said,\r\nthat in a memorandum respecting the theatre I had ‘made him look\r\nridiculous’ (ihm an den Laden gelegt). In answer to this I did not\r\nrefrain from telling him how I intended to act in retaliation, and when\r\nhe threatened to report me to the King and demand my dismissal, I\r\ncalmly replied that he might do as he pleased, as I was well assured\r\nthat I could rely on his Majesty’s justice to hear, not only his\r\ncharges, but also my defence. Moreover, I added, this was the only\r\nbefitting manner for me to discuss with the King the many points on\r\nwhich I had to complain, not only in my own interests, but also in\r\nthose of the theatre and of art. This was not pleasant hearing for\r\nLüttichau, and he asked how it was possible for him to try and\r\nco-operate with me, when I for my part had openly declared (to use his\r\nown expression) that all labour was wasted upon him (Hopfen und Malz\r\nverloren seien). We had at last to part with mutual shruggings of the\r\nshoulder. My conduct seemed to trouble my former patron, and he\r\ntherefore enlisted the tact and moderation of Eduard Devrient in his\r\nservice, and asked him to use his influence with me to facilitate some\r\nfurther arrangement between us. But, in spite of all his zeal, Devrient\r\nhad to admit with a smile, after we had discussed his message, that\r\nnothing much could be done; and as I persisted in my refusal to meet\r\nthe director again in consultation respecting the service of the\r\ntheatre, he had at last to recognise that his own wisdom would have to\r\nhelp him out of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole period during which I was fated to fill the post\r\nof conductor at Dresden, the effects of this dislike on the part of the\r\ncourt and the director continued to make themselves felt in everything.\r\nThe orchestral concerts, which had been organised by me in the previous\r\nwinter, were this year placed under Reissiger’s control, and at once\r\nsank to the usual level of ordinary concerts. Public interest quickly\r\nwaned, and the undertaking could only with difficulty be kept alive. In\r\nopera I was unable to carry out the proposed revival of the Fliegender\r\nHolländer, for which I had found in Mitterwurzer’s maturer talent an\r\nadmirable and promising exponent. My niece Johanna, whom I had destined\r\nfor the part of Senta, did not like the role, because it offered little\r\nopportunity for splendid costumes. She preferred ZAMPA and FAVORITA,\r\npartly to please her new protector, my erstwhile RIENZI enthusiast,\r\nTichatschck, partly for the sake of THREE BRILLIANT COSTUMES which the\r\nmanagement had to furnish for each of these parts. In fact, these two\r\nringleaders of the Dresden opera of that day had formed an alliance of\r\nrebellion against my vigorous rule in the matter of operatic\r\nrepertoire. Their opposition, to my great discomfiture, was crowned by\r\nsuccess when they secured the production of this FAVORITA of\r\nDonizetti’s, the arrangement of which I had once been obliged to\r\nundertake for Schlesinger in Paris. I had at first emphatically refused\r\nto have anything to do with this opera, although its principal part\r\nsuited my niece’s voice admirably, even in her father’s judgment. But\r\nnow that they knew of my feud with the director, and of my voluntary\r\nloss of influence, and finally of my evident disgrace, they thought the\r\nopportunity ripe for compelling me to conduct this tiresome work\r\nmyself, as it happened to be my turn.\r\n\r\nBesides this, my chief occupation at the royal theatre during this\r\nperiod consisted in conducting Flotow’s opera MARTHA, which, although\r\nit failed to attract the public, was nevertheless produced with\r\nexcessive frequency, owing to its convenient cast. On reviewing the\r\nresults of my labours in Dresden—where I had now been nearly seven\r\nyears—I could not help feeling humiliated when I considered the\r\npowerful and energetic impetus I knew I had given in many directions to\r\nthe court theatre, and I found myself obliged to confess that, were I\r\nnow to leave Dresden, not, the smallest trace of my influence would\r\nremain behind. From various signs I also gathered that, if ever it\r\nshould come to a trial before the King between the director and myself,\r\neven if his Majesty were in my favour, yet out of consideration for the\r\ncourtier the verdict would go against me.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on Palm Sunday of the new year, 1849, I received ample\r\namends. In order to ensure liberal receipts, our orchestra had again\r\ndecided to produce Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Every one did his utmost\r\nto make this one of our finest performances, and the public took up the\r\nmatter with real enthusiasm. Michael Bakunin, unknown to the police,\r\nhad been present at the public rehearsal. At its close he walked\r\nunhesitatingly up to me in the orchestra, and said in a loud voice,\r\nthat if all the music that had ever been written were lost in the\r\nexpected world-wide conflagration, we must pledge ourselves to rescue\r\nthis symphony, even at the peril of our lives. Not many weeks after\r\nthis performance it really seemed as though this world-wide\r\nconflagration would actually be kindled in the streets of Dresden, and\r\nthat Bakunin, with whom I had meanwhile become more closely associated\r\nthrough strange and unusual circumstances, would undertake the office\r\nof chief stoker.\r\n\r\nIt was long before this date that I first made the acquaintance of this\r\nmost remarkable man. For years I had come across his name in the\r\nnewspapers, and always under extraordinary circumstances. He turned up\r\nin Paris at a Polish gathering, but although he was a Russian, he\r\ndeclared that it mattered little whether a man were a Russian or a\r\nPole, so long as he wanted to be a free man, and that this was all that\r\nmattered. I heard afterwards, through George Herwegh, that he had\r\nrenounced all his sources of income as a member of an influential\r\nRussian family, and that one day, when his entire fortune consisted of\r\ntwo francs, he had given them away to a beggar on the boulevard,\r\nbecause it was irksome to him to be bound by this possession to take\r\nany thought for the morrow. I was informed of his presence in Dresden\r\none day by Röckel, after the latter had become a rampant republican. He\r\nhad taken the Russian into his house, and invited me to come and make\r\nhis acquaintance. Bakunin was at that time being persecuted by the\r\nAustrian government for his share in the events which took place in\r\nPrague in the summer of 1848, and because he was a member of the Slav\r\nCongress which had preceded them. He had consequently sought refuge in\r\nour city, as he did not wish to settle too far from the Bohemian\r\nfrontier. The extraordinary sensation he had created in Prague arose\r\nfrom the fact that, when the Czechs sought the protection of Russia\r\nagainst the dreaded Germanising policy of Austria, he conjured them to\r\ndefend themselves with fire and sword against those very Russians, and\r\nindeed against any other people who lived under the rule of a despotism\r\nlike that of the Tsars. This superficial acquaintance with Balumin’s\r\naims had sufficed to change the purely national prejudices of the\r\nGermans against him into sympathy. When I met him, therefore, under the\r\nhumble shelter of Röckel’s roof, I was immediately struck by his\r\nsingular and altogether imposing personality. He was in the full bloom\r\nof manhood, anywhere between thirty and forty years of age. Everything\r\nabout him was colossal, and he was full of a primitive exuberance and\r\nstrength. I never gathered that he set much store by my acquaintance.\r\nIndeed, he did not seem to care for merely intellectual men; what he\r\ndemanded was men of reckless energy. As I afterwards perceived, theory\r\nin this case had more weight with him than purely personal sentiment;\r\nand he talked much and expatiated freely on the matter. His general\r\nmode of discussion was the Socratic method, and he seemed quite at his\r\nease when, stretched on his host’s hard sofa, he could argue\r\ndiscursively with a crowd of all sorts of men on the problems of\r\nrevolution. On these occasions he invariably got the best of the\r\nargument. It was impossible to triumph against his opinions, stated as\r\nthey were with the utmost conviction, and overstepping in every\r\ndirection even the extremest bounds of radicalism. So communicative was\r\nhe, that on the very first evening of our meeting he gave me full\r\ndetails about the various stages of his development, he was a Russian\r\nofficer of high birth, but smarting under the yoke of the narrowest\r\nmartial tyranny, he had been led by a study of Rousseau’s writings to\r\nescape to Germany under pretence of taking furlough. In Berlin he had\r\nflung himself into the study of philosophy with all the zest of a\r\nbarbarian newly awakened to civilisation. Hegel’s philosophy was the\r\none which was the rage at that moment, and he soon became such an\r\nexpert in it, that he had been able to hurl that master’s most famous\r\ndisciples from the saddle of their own philosophy, in a thesis couched\r\nin terms of the strictest Hegelian dialectic. After he had got\r\nphilosophy off his chest, as he expressed it, he proceeded to\r\nSwitzerland, where he preached communism, and thence wandered over\r\nFrance and Germany back to the borderland of the Slav world, from which\r\nquarter he looked for the regeneration of humanity, because the Slavs\r\nhad been less enervated by civilisation. His hopes in this respect were\r\ncentred in the more strongly pronounced Slav type characteristic of the\r\nRussian peasant class. In the natural detestation of the Russian serf\r\nfor his cruel oppressor the nobleman, he believed he could trace a\r\nsubstratum of simple-minded brotherly love, and that instinct which\r\nleads animals to hate the men who hunt them. In support of this idea he\r\ncited the childish, almost demoniac delight of the Russian people in\r\nfire, a quality on which Rostopschin calculated in his strategic\r\nburning of Moscow. He argued that all that was necessary to set in\r\nmotion a world-wide movement was to convince the Russian peasant, in\r\nwhom the natural goodness of oppressed human nature had preserved its\r\nmost childlike characteristics, that it was perfectly right and well\r\npleasing to God for them to burn their lords’ castles, with everything\r\nin and about them. The least that could result from such a movement\r\nwould be the destruction of all those things which, rightly considered,\r\nmust appear, even to Europe’s most philosophical thinkers, the real\r\nsource of all the misery of the modern world. To set these destructive\r\nforces in action appeared to him the only object worthy of a sensible\r\nman’s activity. (Even while he was preaching these horrible doctrines,\r\nBakunin, noticing that my eyes troubled me, shielded them with his\r\noutstretched hand from the naked light for a full hour, in spite of my\r\nprotestations.) This annihilation of all civilisation was the goal upon\r\nwhich his heart was set. Meanwhile it amused him to utilise every lever\r\nof political agitation he could lay hands on for the advancement of\r\nthis aim, and in so doing he often found cause for ironical merriment.\r\nIn his retreat he received people belonging to every shade of\r\nrevolutionary thought. Nearest to him stood those of Slav nationality,\r\nbecause these, he thought, would be the most convenient and effective\r\nweapons he could use in the uprooting of Russian despotism. In spite of\r\ntheir republic and their socialism a la Proudhon, he thought nothing of\r\nthe French, and as for the Germans, he never mentioned them to me.\r\nDemocracy, republicanism, and anything else of the kind he regarded as\r\nunworthy of serious consideration.\r\n\r\nEvery objection raised by those who had the slightest wish to\r\nreconstruct what had been demolished, he met with overwhelming\r\ncriticism. I well remember on one occasion that a Pole, startled by his\r\ntheories, maintained that there must be an organised state to guarantee\r\nthe individual in the possession of the fields he had cultivated.\r\n‘What!’ he answered; ‘would you carefully fence in your field to\r\nprovide a livelihood for the police again!’ This shut the mouth of the\r\nterrified Pole. He comforted himself by saying that the creators of the\r\nnew order of things would arise of themselves, but that our sole\r\nbusiness in the meantime was to find the power to destroy. Was any one\r\nof us so mad as to fancy that he would survive the desired destruction?\r\nWe ought to imagine the whole of Europe with St. Petersburg, Paris, and\r\nLondon transformed into a vast rubbish-heap. How could we expect the\r\nkindlers of such a fire to retain any consciousness after so vast a\r\ndevastation? He used to puzzle any who professed their readiness for\r\nself-sacrifice by telling them it was not the so-called tyrants who\r\nwere so obnoxious, but the smug Philistines. As a type of these he\r\npointed to a Protestant parson, and declared that he would not believe\r\nhe had really reached the full stature of a man until he saw him commit\r\nhis own parsonage, with his wife and child, to the flames.\r\n\r\nI was all the more perplexed for a while, in the face of such dreadful\r\nideas, by the fact that Bakunin in other respects proved a really\r\namiable and tender-hearted man. He was fully alive to my own anxiety\r\nand despair with regard to the risk I ran of forever destroying my\r\nideals and hopes for the future of art. It is true, he declined to\r\nreceive any further instruction concerning these artistic schemes, and\r\nwould not even look at my work on the Nibelungen saga. I had just then\r\nbeen inspired by a study of the Gospels to conceive the plan of a\r\ntragedy for the ideal stage of the future, entitled Jesus of Nazareth.\r\nBakunin begged me to spare him any details; and when I sought to win\r\nhim over to my project by a few verbal hints, he wished me luck, but\r\ninsisted that I must at all costs make Jesus appear as a weak\r\ncharacter. As for the music of the piece, he advised me, amid all the\r\nvariations, to use only one set of phrases, namely: for the tenor, ‘Off\r\nwith His head!’; for the soprano, ‘Hang Him!’; and for the basso\r\ncontinuo, ‘Fire! fire!’ And yet I felt more sympathetically drawn\r\ntowards this prodigy of a man when I one day induced him to hear me\r\nplay and sing the first scenes of my Fliegender Holländer. After\r\nlistening with more attention than most people gave, he exclaimed,\r\nduring a momentary pause, ‘That is stupendously fine!’ and wanted to\r\nhear more.\r\n\r\nAs his life of permanent concealment was very dull, I occasionally\r\ninvited him to spend an evening with me. For supper my wife set before\r\nhim finely cut slices of sausage and meat, which he at once devoured\r\nwholesale, instead of spreading them frugally on his bread in Saxon\r\nfashion. Noticing Minna’s alarm at this, I was guilty of the weakness\r\nof telling him how we were accustomed to consume such viands, whereupon\r\nhe reassured me with a laugh, saying that it was quite enough, only he\r\nwould like to eat what was set before him in his own way. I was\r\nsimilarly astonished at the manner in which he drank wine from our\r\nordinary-sized small glasses. As a matter of fact he detested wine,\r\nwhich only satisfied his craving for alcoholic stimulants in such\r\npaltry, prolonged, and subdivided doses; whereas a stiff glass of\r\nbrandy, swallowed at a gulp, at once produced the same result, which,\r\nafter all, was only temporarily attained. Above all, he scorned the\r\nsentiment which seeks to prolong enjoyment by moderation, arguing that\r\na true man should only strive to still the cravings of nature, and that\r\nthe only real pleasure in life worthy of a man was love.\r\n\r\nThese and other similar little characteristics showed clearly that in\r\nthis remarkable man the purest impulses of an ideal humanity conflicted\r\nstrangely with a savagery entirely inimical to all civilisation, so\r\nthat my feelings during my intercourse with him fluctuated between\r\ninvoluntary horror and irresistible attraction. I frequently called for\r\nhim to share my lonely wanderings. This he gladly did, not only for the\r\nsake of necessary bodily exercise, but also because he could do so in\r\nthis part of the world without fear of meeting his pursuers. My\r\nattempts during our conversations to instruct him more fully regarding\r\nmy artistic aims remained quite unavailing as long as we were unable to\r\nquit the field of mere discussion. All these things seemed to him\r\npremature. He refused to admit that out of the very needs of the evil\r\npresent all laws for the future would have to be evolved, and that\r\nthese, moreover, must be moulded upon quite different ideas of social\r\nculture. Seeing that he continued to urge destruction, and again\r\ndestruction, I had at last to inquire how my wonderful friend proposed\r\nto set this work of destruction in operation. It then soon became\r\nclear, as I had suspected it would, and as the event soon proved, that\r\nwith this man of boundless activity everything rested upon the most\r\nimpossible hypotheses. Doubtless I, with my hopes of a future artistic\r\nremodelling of human society, appeared to him to be floating in the\r\nbarren air; yet it soon became obvious to me that his assumptions as to\r\nthe unavoidable demolition of all the institutions of culture were at\r\nleast equally visionary. My first idea was that Bakunin was the centre\r\nof an international conspiracy; but his practical plans seem originally\r\nto have been restricted to a project for revolutionising Prague, where\r\nhe relied merely on a union formed among a handful of students.\r\nBelieving that the time had now come to strike a blow, he prepared\r\nhimself one evening to go there. This proceeding was not free from\r\ndanger, and he set off under the protection of a passport made out for\r\nan English merchant. First of all, however, with the view of adapting\r\nhimself to the most Philistine culture, he had to submit his huge beard\r\nand bushy hair to the tender mercies of the razor and shears. As no\r\nbarber was available, Röckel had to undertake the task. A small group\r\nof friends watched the operation, which had to be executed with a dull\r\nrazor, causing no little pain, under which none but the victim himself\r\nremained passive. We bade farewell to Bakunin with the firm conviction\r\nthat we should never see him again alive. But in a week he was back\r\nonce more, as he had realised immediately what a distorted account he\r\nhad received as to the state of things in Prague, where all he found\r\nready for him was a mere handful of childish students. These admissions\r\nmade him the butt of Röckel’s good-humoured chaff, and after this he\r\nwon the reputation among us of being a mere revolutionary, who was\r\ncontent with theoretical conspiracy. Very similar to his expectations\r\nfrom the Prague students were his presumptions with regard to the\r\nRussian people. These also afterwards proved to be entirely groundless,\r\nand based merely on gratuitous assumptions drawn from the supposed\r\nnature of things. I consequently found myself driven to explain the\r\nuniversal belief in the terrible dangerousness of this man by his\r\ntheoretical views, as expressed here and elsewhere, and not as arising\r\nfrom any actual experience of his practical activity. But I was soon to\r\nbecome almost an eye-witness of the fact that his personal conduct was\r\nnever for a moment swayed by prudence, such as one is accustomed to\r\nmeet in those whose theories are not seriously meant. This was shortly\r\nto be proved in the momentous insurrection of May, 1849.\r\n\r\nThe winter of this year, up to the spring of 1849, passed in a\r\nmany-sided development of my position and temper, as I have described\r\nthem, that is to say, in a sort of dull agitation. My latest artistic\r\noccupation had been the five-act drama, Jesus of Nazareth, just\r\nmentioned. Henceforth I lingered on in a state of brooding instability,\r\nfull of expectation, yet without any definite wish. I felt fully\r\nconvinced that my activity in Dresden, as an artist, had come to an\r\nend, and I was only waiting for the pressure of circumstances to shake\r\nmyself free. On the other hand, the whole political situation, both in\r\nSaxony and the rest of Germany, tended inevitably towards a\r\ncatastrophe. Day by day this drew nearer, and I flattered myself into\r\nregarding my own personal fate as interwoven with this universal\r\nunrest. Now that the powers of reaction were everywhere more and more\r\nopenly bracing themselves for conflict, the final decisive struggle\r\nseemed indeed close at hand. My feelings of partisanship were not\r\nsufficiently passionate to make me desire to take any active share in\r\nthese conflicts. I was merely conscious of an impulse to give myself up\r\nrecklessly to the stream of events, no matter whither it might lead.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, however, an entirely new influence forced itself\r\nin a most strange fashion into my fortunes, and was at first greeted by\r\nme with a smile of scepticism. Liszt wrote announcing an early\r\nproduction in Weimar of my Tannhäuser under his own conductorship—the\r\nfirst that had taken place outside Dresden—and he added with great\r\nmodesty that this was merely a fulfilment of his own personal desire.\r\nIn order to ensure success he had sent a special invitation to\r\nTichatschek to be his guest for the two first performances. When the\r\nlatter returned he said that the production had, on the whole, been a\r\nsuccess, which surprised me very much. I received a gold snuff-box from\r\nthe Grand Duke as a keepsake, which I continued to use until the year\r\n1864. All this was new and strange to me, and I was still inclined to\r\nregard this otherwise agreeable occurrence as a fleeting episode, due\r\nto the friendly feeling of a great artist. ‘What does this mean for\r\nme?’ I asked myself. ‘Has it come too early or too late?’ But a very\r\ncordial letter from Liszt induced me to visit Weimar for a few days\r\nlater on, for a third performance of Tannhausar, which was to be\r\ncarried out entirely by native talent, with a view to the permanent\r\naddition of this opera to the repertoire. For this purpose I obtained\r\nleave of absence from my management for the second week in May.\r\n\r\nOnly a few days elapsed before the execution of this little plan; but\r\nthey were destined to be momentous ones. On the 1st of May the Chambers\r\nwere dissolved by the new Beust ministry, which the King had charged\r\nwith carrying out his proposed reactionary policy. This event imposed\r\nupon me the friendly task of caring for Röckel and his family. Hitherto\r\nhis position as a deputy had shielded him from the danger of criminal\r\nprosecution; but as soon as the Chambers were dissolved this protection\r\nwas withdrawn, and he had to escape by flight from being arrested\r\nagain. As I could do little to help him in this matter, I promised at\r\nleast to provide for the continued publication of his popular\r\nVolksblatt, mainly because the proceeds from this would support his\r\nfamily. Scarcely was Röckel safely across the Bohemian frontier, while\r\nI was still toiling at great inconvenience to myself in the printer’s\r\noffice, in order to provide material for an issue of his paper, when\r\nthe long-expected storm burst over Dresden. Emergency deputations,\r\nnightly mob demonstrations, stormy meetings of the various unions, and\r\nall the other signs that precede a swift decision in the streets,\r\nmanifested themselves. On the 3rd May the demeanour of the crowds\r\nmoving in our thoroughfares plainly showed that this consummation would\r\nsoon be reached, as was undoubtedly desired. Each local deputation\r\nwhich petitioned for the recognition of the German constitution, which\r\nwas the universal cry, was refused an audience by the government, and\r\nthis with a peremptoriness which at last became startling. I was\r\npresent one afternoon at a committee meeting of the Vaterlands-Verein,\r\nalthough merely as a representative of Röckel’s Volksblatt, for whose\r\ncontinuance, both from economic as well as humane motives, I felt\r\npledged. Here I was at once absorbed in watching the conduct and\r\ndemeanour of the men whom popular favour had raised to the leadership\r\nof such unions. It was quite evident that events had passed beyond the\r\ncontrol of these persons; more particularly were they utterly at a loss\r\nas to how to deal with that peculiar terrorism exerted by the lower\r\nclasses which is always so ready to react upon the representatives of\r\ndemocratic theories. On every side I heard a medley of wild proposals\r\nand hesitating responses. One of the chief subjects under debate was\r\nthe necessity of preparing for defence. Arms, and how to procure them,\r\nwere eagerly discussed, but all in the midst of great disorder; and\r\nwhen at last they discovered that it was time to break up, the only\r\nimpression I received was one of the wildest confusion. I loft the hall\r\nwith a young painter named Kaufmann, from whose hand I had previously\r\nseen a series of cartoons in the Dresden Art Exhibition, illustrating\r\n‘The History of the Mind.’ One day I had seen the King of Saxony\r\nstanding before one of these, representing the torture of a heretic\r\nunder the Spanish Inquisition, and observed him turn away with a\r\ndisapproving shake of the head from so abstruse a subject. I was on my\r\nway home, deep in conversation with this man, whose pale face and\r\ntroubled look betrayed that he foresaw the disaster that was imminent,\r\nwhen, just as we reached the Postplatz, near the fountain erected from\r\nSemper’s design, the clang of bells from the neighbouring tower of St.\r\nAnn’s Church suddenly sounded the tocsin of revolt. With a terrified\r\ncry, ‘Good God, it has begun!’ my companion vanished from my side. He\r\nwrote to me—afterwards to say that he was living as a fugitive in\r\nBerne, but I never saw his face again.\r\n\r\nThe clang of this bell, so close at hand, made a profound impression\r\nupon me also. It was a very sunny afternoon, and I at once noticed the\r\nsame phenomenon which Goethe describes in his attempt to depict his own\r\nsensations during the bombardment of Valmy. The whole square looked as\r\nthough it were illuminated by a dark yellow, almost brown, light, such\r\nas I had once before seen in Magdeburg during an eclipse of the sun. My\r\nmost pronounced sensation beyond this was one of great, almost\r\nextravagant, satisfaction. I felt a sudden strange longing to play with\r\nsomething hitherto regarded as dangerous and important. My first idea,\r\nsuggested probably by the vicinity of the square, was to inquire at\r\nTichatschek’s house for the gun which, as an enthusiastic Sunday\r\nsportsman, he was accustomed to use. I only found his wife at home, as\r\nhe was away on a holiday tour. Her evident terror as to what was going\r\nto happen provoked me to uncontrollable laughter. I advised her to\r\nlodge her husband’s gun in a place of safety, by handing it to the\r\ncommittee of the Vaterlands-Verein in return for a receipt, as it might\r\notherwise soon be requisitioned by the mob. I have since learned that\r\nmy eccentric behaviour on this occasion, was afterwards reckoned\r\nagainst me as a serious crime. I then returned to the streets, to see\r\nwhether anything beyond a ringing of bells and a yellowish eclipse of\r\nthe sun might be going on in the town, I first made my way to the Old\r\nMarket-place, where I noticed a group of men gathered round a\r\nvociferous orator. It was also an agreeable surprise to me to see\r\nSchroder-Devrient descending at the door of a hotel. She had just\r\narrived from Merlin, and was keenly excited by the news which had\r\nreached her, that the populace had already been fired upon. As she had\r\nonly recently seen an abortive insurrection crushed by arms in Berlin,\r\nshe was indignant to find the same things happening in her ‘peaceful\r\nDresden’ as she termed it.\r\n\r\nWhen she turned to me from the stolid crowd, which had complacently\r\nbeen listening to her passionate outpourings, she seemed relieved at\r\nfinding some one to whom she could appeal to oppose these horrible\r\nproceedings with all his might. I met her on another occasion at the\r\nhouse of my old friend Heine, where she had taken refuge. When she\r\nnoticed my indifference she again adjured me to use every possible\r\neffort to prevent the senseless, suicidal conflict. I heard afterwards\r\nthat a charge of high treason on account of sedition had been brought\r\nagainst Schroder-Devrient by reason of her conduct in regard to this\r\nmatter. She had to prove her innocence in a court of law, so as to\r\nestablish beyond dispute her claim to the pension which she had been\r\npromised by contract for her many years’ service in Dresden as an\r\nopera-singer.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of May I betook myself direct to that quarter of the town\r\nwhere I heard unpleasant rumours of a sanguinary conflict having taken\r\nplace. I afterwards learned that the actual cause of the dispute\r\nbetween the civil and military power had arisen when the watch had been\r\nchanged in front of the Arsenal. At that moment the mob, under a bold\r\nleader, had seized the opportunity to take forcible possession of the\r\narmoury. A display of military force was made, and the crowd was fired\r\nupon by a few cannon loaded with grape-shot. As I approached the scene\r\nof operations through the Rampische Gasse, I met a company of the\r\nDresden Communal Guards, who, although they were quite innocent, had\r\napparently been exposed to this fire. I noticed that one of the citizen\r\nguards, leaning heavily on the arm of a comrade, was trying to hurry\r\nalong, in spite of the fact that his right leg seemed to be dragging\r\nhelplessly behind him. Some of the crowd, seeing the blood on the\r\npavement behind him, shouted ‘He is bleeding.’ In the midst of this\r\nexcitement I suddenly became conscious of the cry raised on all sides:\r\n‘To the barricades! to the barricades!’ Driven by a mechanical impulse\r\nI followed the stream of people, which moved once more in the direction\r\nof the Town Hall in the Old Market-place. Amid the terrific tumult I\r\nparticularly noticed a significant group stretching right across the\r\nstreet, and striding along the Rosmaringasse. It reminded me, though\r\nthe simile was rather exaggerated, of the crowd that had once stood at\r\nthe doors of the theatre and demanded free entrance to Rienzi; among\r\nthem was a hunchback, who at once suggested Goethe’s Vansen in Egmont,\r\nand as the revolutionary cry rose about his ears, I saw him rub his\r\nhands together in great glee over the long-desired ecstasy of revolt\r\nwhich he had realised at last.\r\n\r\nI recollect quite clearly that from that moment I was attracted by\r\nsurprise and interest in the drama, without feeling any desire to join\r\nthe ranks of the combatants. However, the agitation caused by my\r\nsympathy as a mere spectator increased with every step I felt impelled\r\nto take. I was able to press right into the rooms of the town council,\r\nescaping notice in the tumultuous crowd, and it seemed to me as if the\r\nofficials were guilty of collusion with the mob. I made my way\r\nunobserved into the council-chamber; what I saw there was utter\r\ndisorder and confusion. When night fell I wandered slowly through the\r\nhastily made barricades, consisting chiefly of market stalls, back to\r\nmy house in the distant Friedrichstrasse, and next morning I again\r\nwatched these amazing proceedings with sympathetic interest.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, 4th May, I could see that the Town Hall was gradually\r\nbecoming the undoubted centre of the revolution. That section of the\r\npeople who had hoped for a peaceful understanding with the monarch was\r\nthrown into the utmost consternation by the news that the King and his\r\nwhole court, acting on the advice of his minister Beust, had left the\r\npalace, and had gone by ship down the Elbe to the fortress of\r\nKonigstein. In those circumstances the town council saw they were no\r\nlonger able to face the situation, and thereupon took part in summoning\r\nthose members of the Saxon Chamber who were still in Dresden. These\r\nlatter now assembled in the Town Hall to decide what steps should be\r\ntaken for the protection of the state. A deputation was sent to the\r\nministry, but returned with the report that they were nowhere to be\r\nfound. At the same moment news arrived from all sides that, in\r\naccordance with a previous compact, the King of Prussia’s troops would\r\nadvance to occupy Dresden. A general outcry immediately arose for\r\nmeasures to be adopted to prevent this incursion of foreign troops.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with this, came the intelligence of the national\r\nuprising in Wurtemberg, where the troops themselves had frustrated the\r\nintentions of the government by their declaration of fidelity to the\r\nparliament, and the ministry had been compelled against their will to\r\nacknowledge the Pan-German Constitution. The opinion of our\r\npoliticians, who were assembled in consultation, was that the matter\r\nmight still be settled by peaceful means, if it were possible to induce\r\nthe Saxon troops to take up a similar attitude, as by this means the\r\nKing would at least be placed under the wholesome necessity of offering\r\npatriotic resistance to the Prussian occupation of his country.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to depend on making the Saxon battalions in Dresden\r\nunderstand the paramount importance of their action. As this seemed to\r\nme the only hope of an honourable peace in this senseless chaos, I\r\nconfess that, on this one occasion, I did allow myself to be led astray\r\nso far as to organise a demonstration which, however, proved futile.\r\n\r\nI induced the printer of Röckel’s Volksblatt, which was for the moment\r\nat a standstill, to employ all the type he would have used for his next\r\nnumber, in printing in huge characters on strips of paper the words:\r\nSeid Ihr mit uns gegen fremde Truppen? (‘Are you on our side against\r\nthe foreign troops?’). Placards bearing these words were fixed on those\r\nbarricades which it was thought would be the first to be assaulted, and\r\nwere intended to bring the Saxon troops to a halt if they were\r\ncommanded to attack the revolutionaries. Of course no one took any\r\nnotice of these placards except intending informers. On that day\r\nnothing but confused negotiations and wild excitement took place which\r\nthrew no light on the situation. The Old Town of Dresden, with its\r\nbarricades, was an interesting enough sight for the spectators. I\r\nlooked on with amazement and disgust, but my attention was suddenly\r\ndistracted by seeing Bakunin emerge from his hiding-place and wander\r\namong the barricades in a black frockcoat. But I was very much mistaken\r\nin thinking he would be pleased with what he saw; he recognised the\r\nchildish inefficiency of all the measures that had been taken for\r\ndefence, and declared that the only satisfaction he could feel in the\r\nstate of affairs was that he need not trouble about the police, but\r\ncould calmly consider the question of going elsewhere, as he found no\r\ninducement to take part in an insurrection conducted in such a slovenly\r\nfashion. While he walked about, smoking his cigar, and making fun of\r\nthe naivete of the Dresden revolution, I watched the Communal Guards\r\nassembling under arms in front of the Town Hall at the summons of their\r\ncommandant. From the ranks of its most popular corps, the\r\nSchützen-Compagnie, I was accosted by Rietschel, who was most anxious\r\nabout the nature of the rising, and also by Semper. Rietschel, who\r\nseemed to think I was better informed of the facts than he was, assured\r\nme that he felt his position was a very difficult one. He said the\r\nselect company to which he belonged was very democratic, and as his\r\nprofessorship at the Fine Arts Academy placed him in a peculiar\r\nposition, he did not know how to reconcile the sentiments he shared\r\nwith his company with his duty as a citizen. The word ‘citizen’ amused\r\nme; I glanced sharply at Semper and repeated the word ‘citizen.’ Semper\r\nresponded with a peculiar smile, and turned away without further\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nThe next day (Friday the 5th of May), when I again took my place as a\r\npassionately interested spectator of the proceedings at the Town Hall,\r\nevents took a decisive turn. The remnant of the leaders of the Saxon\r\npeople there assembled thought it advisable to constitute themselves\r\ninto a provisional government, as there was no Saxon government in\r\nexistence with which negotiations could be conducted. Professor Kochly,\r\nwho was an eloquent speaker, was chosen to proclaim the new\r\nadministration. He performed this solemn ceremony from the balcony of\r\nthe Town Hall, facing the faithful remnant of the Communal Guards and\r\nthe not very numerous crowd. At the same time the legal existence of\r\nthe Pan-German Constitution was proclaimed, and allegiance to it was\r\nsworn by the armed forces of the nation. I recollect that these\r\nproceedings did not seem to me imposing, and Bakunin’s reiterated\r\nopinion about their triviality gradually became more comprehensible.\r\nEven from a technical point of view these reflections were justified\r\nwhen, to my great amusement and surprise, Semper, in the full uniform\r\nof a citizen guard, with a hat bedecked with the national colours,\r\nasked for me at the Town Hall, and informed me of the extremely faulty\r\nconstruction of the barricades in the Wild Strufergasse and the\r\nneighbouring Brudergasse. To pacify his artistic conscience as an\r\nengineer I directed him to the office of the ‘Military Commission for\r\nthe Defence.’ He followed my advice with conscientious satisfaction;\r\npossibly he obtained the necessary authorisation to give instructions\r\nfor the building of suitable works of defence at that neglected point.\r\nAfter that I never saw him again in Dresden; but I presume that he\r\ncarried out the strategic works entrusted to him by that committee with\r\nall the conscientiousness of a Michael Angelo or a Leonardo da Vinci.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day passed in continuous negotiations over the truce\r\nwhich, by arrangement with the Saxon troops, was to last until noon of\r\nthe next day. In this business I noticed the very pronounced activity\r\nof a former college friend, Marschall von Bieberstein, a lawyer who, in\r\nhis capacity as senior officer of the Dresden Communal Guard,\r\ndistinguished himself by his boundless zeal amid the shouts of a mighty\r\nband of fellow-orators. On that day a certain Heinz, formerly a Greek\r\ncolonel, was placed in command of the armed forces. These proceedings\r\ndid not seem at all satisfactory to Bakunin, who put in an occasional\r\nappearance. While the provisional government placed all its hopes on\r\nfinding a peaceful settlement of the conflict by moral persuasion, he,\r\non the contrary, with his clear vision foresaw a well-planned military\r\nattack by the Prussians, and thought it could only be met by good\r\nstrategic measures. He therefore urgently pressed for the acquisition\r\nof some experienced Polish officers who happened to be in Dresden, as\r\nthe Saxon revolutionaries appeared to be absolutely lacking in military\r\ntactics. Everybody was afraid to take this course; on the other hand,\r\ngreat expectations were entertained from negotiations with the\r\nFrankfort States Assembly, which was on its last legs. Everything was\r\nto be done as far as possible in legal form. The time passed pleasantly\r\nenough. Elegant ladies with their cavaliers promenaded the barricaded\r\nstreets during those beautiful spring evenings. It seemed to be little\r\nmore than an entertaining drama. The unaccustomed aspect of things even\r\nafforded me genuine pleasure, combined with a feeling that the whole\r\nthing was not quite serious, and that a friendly proclamation from the\r\ngovernment would put an end to it. So I strolled comfortably home\r\nthrough the numerous barricades at a late hour, thinking as I went of\r\nthe material for a drama, Achilleus, with which I had been occupied for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\nAt home I found my two nieces, Clara and Ottilie Brockhaus, the\r\ndaughters of my sister Louisa. They had been living for a year with a\r\ngoverness in Dresden, and their weekly visits and contagious good\r\nspirits delighted me. Every one was in a high state of glee about the\r\nrevolution; they all heartily approved of the barricades, and felt no\r\nscruples about desiring victory for their defenders. Protected by the\r\ntruce, this state of mind remained undisturbed the whole of Friday (5th\r\nMay). From all parts came news which led us to believe in a universal\r\nuprising throughout Germany. Baden and the Palatinate were in the\r\nthroes of a revolt on behalf of the whole of Germany. Similar rumours\r\ncame in from free towns like Breslau. In Leipzig, volunteer student\r\ncorps had mustered contingents for Dresden, which arrived amid the\r\nexultation of the populace. A fully equipped defence department was\r\norganised at the Town Hall, and young Heine, disappointed like myself\r\nin his hopes of the performance of Lohengrin, had also joined this\r\nbody. Vigorous promises of support came from the Saxon Erzgebirge, as\r\nwell as announcements that armed contingents were forthcoming. Every\r\none thought, therefore, that if only the Old Town were kept well\r\nbarricaded, it could safely defy the threat of foreign occupation.\r\nEarly on Saturday, 6th May, it was obvious that the situation was\r\nbecoming more serious. Prussian troops had marched into the New Town,\r\nand the Saxon troops, which it had not been considered advisable to use\r\nfor an attack, were kept loyal to the flag. The truce expired at noon,\r\nand the troops, supported by several guns, at once opened the attack on\r\none, of the principal positions held by the people on the Neumarkt.\r\n\r\nSo far I had entertained no other conviction than that the matter would\r\nbe decided in the most summary fashion as soon as it came to an actual\r\nconflict, for there was no evidence in the state of my own feelings\r\n(or, indeed, in what I was able to gather independently of them) of\r\nthat passionate seriousness of purpose, without which tests as severe\r\nas this have never been successfully withstood. It was irritating to\r\nme, while I heard the sharp rattle of fire, to be unable to gather\r\nanything of what was going on, and I thought by climbing the Kreuz\r\ntower I might get a good view. Even from this elevation I could not see\r\nanything clearly, but I gathered enough to satisfy myself that after an\r\nhour of heavy firing the advance artillery of the Prussian troops had\r\nretired, and had at last been completely silenced, their withdrawal\r\nbeing signalled by a loud shout of jubilation from the populace.\r\nApparently the first attack had exhausted itself; and now my interest\r\nin what was going on began to assume a more and more vivid hue. To\r\nobtain information in greater detail I hurried back to the Town Hall. I\r\ncould extract nothing, however, from the boundless confusion which I\r\nmet, until at last I came upon Bakunin in the midst of the main group\r\nof speakers. He was able to give me an extraordinarily accurate account\r\nof what had happened. Information had reached headquarters from a\r\nbarricade in the Neumarkt where the attack was most serious, that\r\neverything had been in a state of confusion there before the onslaught\r\nof the troops; thereupon my friend Marschall von Bieberstein, together\r\nwith Leo von Zichlinsky, who were officers in the citizen corps, had\r\ncalled up some volunteers and conducted them to the place of danger.\r\nKreis-Amtmann Heubner of Freiberg, without a weapon to defend himself,\r\nand with bared head, jumped immediately on to the top of the barricade,\r\nwhich had just been abandoned by all its defenders. He was the sole\r\nmember of the provisional government to remain on the spot, the\r\nleaders, Todt and Tschirner, having disappeared at the first sign of a\r\npanic. Heubner turned round to exhort the volunteers to advance,\r\naddressing them in stirring words. His success was complete, the\r\nbarricade was taken again, and a fire, as unexpected as it was fierce,\r\nwas directed upon the troops, which, as I myself saw, were forced to\r\nretire. Bakunin had been in close touch with this action, he had\r\nfollowed the volunteers, and he now explained to me that however narrow\r\nmight be the political views of Heubner (he belonged to the moderate\r\nLeft of the Saxon Chamber), he was a man of noble character, at whose\r\nservice he had immediately placed his own life.\r\n\r\nBakunin had only needed this example to determine his own line of\r\nconduct; he had decided to risk his neck in the attempt and to ask no\r\nfurther questions. Heubner too was now bound to recognise the necessity\r\nfor extreme measures, and no longer recoiled from any proposal on the\r\npart of Bakunin which was directed to this end. The military advice of\r\nexperienced Polish officers was brought to bear on the commandant,\r\nwhose incapacity had not been slow to reveal itself; Bakunin, who\r\nopenly confessed that he understood nothing of pure strategy, never\r\nmoved from the Town Hall, but remained at Heubner’s side, giving advice\r\nand information in every direction with wonderful sangfroid. For the\r\nrest of the day the battle confined itself to skirmishes by\r\nsharpshooters from the various positions. I was itching to climb the\r\nKreuz tower again, so as to get the widest possible survey over the\r\nwhole field of action. In order to reach this tower from the Town Hall,\r\none had to pass through a space which was under a cross-fire of\r\nrifle-shots from the troops posted in the royal palace. At a moment\r\nwhen this square was quite deserted, I yielded to my daring impulse,\r\nand crossed it on my way to the Kreuz tower at a slow pace, remembering\r\nthat in such circumstances the young soldier is advised never to hurry,\r\nbecause by so doing he may draw the shot upon himself. On reaching this\r\npost of vantage I found several people who had gathered there, some of\r\nthem driven by a curiosity like my own, others in obedience to an order\r\nfrom the headquarters of the revolutionaries to reconnoitre the enemy’s\r\nmovements. Amongst them I made the acquaintance of a schoolmaster\r\ncalled Berthold, a man of quiet and gentle disposition, but full of\r\nconviction and determination. I lost myself in an earnest philosophical\r\ndiscussion with him which extended to the widest spheres of religion.\r\nAt the same time he showed a homely anxiety to protect us from the\r\ncone-shaped bullets of the Prussian sharpshooters by placing us\r\ningeniously behind a barricade consisting of one of the straw\r\nmattresses which he had cajoled out of the warder. The Prussian\r\nsharpshooters were posted on the distant tower of the Frauenkirche, and\r\nhad chosen the height occupied by us as their target. At nightfall I\r\nfound it impossible to make up my mind to go home and leave my\r\ninteresting place of refuge, so I persuaded the warder to send a\r\nsubordinate to Friedrichstadt with a few lines to my wife, and with\r\ninstructions to ask her to let me have some necessary provisions. Thus\r\nI spent one of the most extraordinary nights of my life, taking turns\r\nwith Berthold to keep watch and sleep, close beneath the great bell\r\nwith its terrible groaning clang, and with the accompaniment of the\r\ncontinuous rattle of the Prussian shot as it beat against the tower\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nSunday (the 7th of May) was one of the most beautiful days in the year.\r\nI was awakened by the song of a nightingale, which rose to our ears\r\nfrom the Schütze garden close by. A sacred calm and peacefulness lay\r\nover the town and the wide suburbs of Dresden, which were visible from\r\nmy point of vantage. Towards sunrise a mist settled upon the outskirts,\r\nand suddenly through its folds we could hear the music of the\r\nMarseillaise making its way clearly and distinctly from the district of\r\nthe Tharanderstrasse. As the sound drew nearer and nearer, the mist\r\ndispersed, and the glow of the rising sun spread a glittering light\r\nupon the weapons of a long column which was winding its way towards the\r\ntown. It was impossible not to feel deeply impressed at the sight of\r\nthis continuous procession. Suddenly a perception of that element which\r\nI had so long missed in the German people was borne in upon me in all\r\nits essential freshness and vital colour. The fact that until this\r\nmoment I had been obliged to resign myself to its absence, had\r\ncontributed not a little to the feelings by which I had been swayed.\r\nHere I beheld some thousand men from the Erzgebirge, mostly miners,\r\nwell armed and organised, who had rallied to the defence of Dresden.\r\nSoon we saw them march up the Altmarkt opposite the Town Hall, and\r\nafter receiving a joyful welcome, bivouac there to recover from their\r\njourney. Reinforcements continued to pour in the whole day long, and\r\nthe heroic achievement of the previous day now received its reward in\r\nthe shape of a universal elevation of spirits. A change seemed to have\r\nbeen made in the plan of attack by the Prussian troops. This could be\r\ngathered from the fact that numerous simultaneous attacks, but of a\r\nless concentrated type, were made upon various positions. The troops\r\nwhich had come to reinforce us brought with them four small cannon, the\r\nproperty of a certain Herr Thade von Burgk, whose acquaintance I had\r\nmade before on the occasion of the anniversary of the founding of the\r\nDresden Choral Society, when he had made a speech which was well\r\nintentioned but wearisome to the point of being ludicrous. The\r\nrecollection of this speech returned to me with peculiar irony, now\r\nthat his cannon were being fired from the barricade upon the enemy. I\r\nfelt a still deeper impression, however, when, towards eleven o’clock,\r\nI saw the old Opera House, in which a few weeks ago I had conducted the\r\nlast performance of the Ninth Symphony, burst into flames. As I have\r\nhad occasion to mention before, the danger from fire to which this\r\nbuilding was exposed, full as it was with wood and all kind of textile\r\nfabric, and originally built only for a temporary purpose, had always\r\nbeen a subject of terror and apprehension to those who visited it.\r\n\r\nI was told that the Opera House had been set alight on strategical\r\ngrounds, in order to face a dangerous attack on this exposed side, and\r\nalso to protect the famous ‘Semper’ barricade from an overpowering\r\nsurprise. From this I concluded that reasons of this kind act as far\r\nmore powerful motives in the world than aesthetic considerations. For a\r\nlong time men of taste had vainly cried aloud for abolition of this\r\nugly building which was such an eyesore by the side of the elegant\r\nproportions of the Zwinger Gallery in its neighbourhood. In a few\r\nmoments the Opera House (which as regards size was, it is true, an\r\nimposing edifice), together with its highly inflammable contents, was a\r\nvast sea of flames. When this reached the metal roofs of the\r\nneighbouring wings of the Zwinger, and enveloped them in wonderful\r\nbluish waves of fire, the first expression of regret made itself\r\naudible amongst the spectators. What a disaster! Some thought that the\r\nNatural History collection was in danger; others maintained that it was\r\nthe Armoury, upon which a citizen soldier retorted that if such were\r\nthe case, it would be a very good job if the ‘stuffed noblemen’ were\r\nburnt to cinders. But it appeared that a keen sense of the value of art\r\nknew how to curb the fire’s lust for further dominion, and, as a matter\r\nof fact, it did but little damage in that quarter. Finally our post of\r\nobservation, which until now had remained comparatively quiet, was\r\nfilled itself with swarms and swarms of armed men, who had been ordered\r\nthither to defend the approach from the church to the Altmarkt, upon\r\nwhich an attack was feared from the side of the ill-secured Kreuzgasse.\r\nUnarmed men were now in the way; moreover, I had received a message\r\nfrom my wife summoning me home after the long and terrible anxiety she\r\nhad suffered.\r\n\r\nAt last, after meeting with innumerable obstacles and overcoming a host\r\nof difficulties, I succeeded, by means of all sorts of circuitous\r\nroutes, in reaching my remote suburb, from which I was cut off by the\r\nfortified portions of the town, and especially by a cannonade directed\r\nfrom the Zwinger. My lodgings were full to overflowing with excited\r\nwomen who had collected round Minna; among them the panic-stricken wife\r\nof Röckel, who suspected her husband of being in the very thick of the\r\nfight, as she thought that on the receipt of the news that Dresden had\r\nrisen he would probably have returned. As a matter of fact, I had heard\r\na rumour that Röckel had arrived on this very day, but as yet I had not\r\nobtained a glimpse of him. My young nieces helped once more to raise my\r\nspirits. The firing had put them into a high state of glee, which to\r\nsome extent infected my wife, as soon as she was reassured as to my\r\npersonal safety. All of them were furious with the sculptor Hänel, who\r\nhad never ceased insisting upon the expedience of bolting the house to\r\nprevent an entry of the revolutionaries. All the women without\r\nexception were joking about his abject terror at the sight of some men\r\narmed with scythes who had appeared in the street In this way Sunday\r\npassed like a sort of family jollification.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning (Monday, 8th May) I tried again to get\r\ninformation as to the state of affairs by forcing my way to the Town\r\nHall from my house, which was cut off from the place of action. As in\r\nthe course of my journey I was making my way over a barricade near St.\r\nAnn’s Church, one of the Communal Guard shouted out to me, ‘Hullo,\r\nconductor, your der Freude schöner Götterfunken[15] has indeed set fire\r\nto things. The rotten building is rased to the ground.’ Obviously the\r\nman was an enthusiastic member of the audience at my last performance\r\nof the Ninth Symphony. Coming upon me so unexpectedly, this pathetic\r\ngreeting filled me with a curious sense of strength and freedom. A\r\nlittle further on, in a lonely alley in the suburb of Plauen, I fell in\r\nwith the musician Hiebendahl, the first oboist in the royal orchestra,\r\nand a man who still enjoyed a very high reputation; he was in the\r\nuniform of the Communal Guards, but carried no gun, and was chatting\r\nwith a citizen in a similar costume. As soon as he saw me, he felt he\r\nmust immediately make an appeal to me to use my influence against\r\nRöckel, who, accompanied by ordnance officers of the revolutionary\r\nparty, was instituting a search for guns in this quarter. As soon as he\r\nrealised that I was making sympathetic inquiries about Röckel, he drew\r\nback frightened, and said to me in tones of the deepest anxiety: ‘But,\r\nconductor, have you no thought for your position, and what you may lose\r\nby exposing yourself in this fashion?’ This remark had the most drastic\r\neffect upon me; I burst into a loud laugh, and told him that my\r\nposition was not worth a thought one way or the other. This indeed was\r\nthe expression of my real feelings, which had long been suppressed, and\r\nnow broke out into almost jubilant utterance. At that moment I caught\r\nsight of Röckel, with two men of the citizen army who were carrying\r\nsome guns, making his way towards me. He gave me a most friendly\r\ngreeting, but turned at once to Hiebendahl and his companion and asked\r\nhim why he was idling about here in uniform instead of being at his\r\npost. When Hiebendahl made the excuse that his gun had been\r\nrequisitioned, Röckel cried out to him, ‘You’re a fine lot of fellows!’\r\nand went away laughing. He gave me a brief account as we proceeded of\r\nwhat had happened to him since I had lost sight of him, and thus spared\r\nme the obligation of giving him a report of his Volksblatt. We were\r\ninterrupted by an imposing troop of well-armed young students of the\r\ngymnasium who had just entered the city and wished to have a safe\r\nconduct to their place of muster. The sight of these serried ranks of\r\nyouthful figures, numbering several hundreds, who were stepping bravely\r\nto their duty, did not fail to make the most elevating impression upon\r\nme. Röckel undertook to accompany them over the barricade in safety to\r\nthe mastering place in front of the Town Hall. He took the opportunity\r\nof lamenting the utter absence of true spirit which he had hitherto\r\nencountered in those in command. He had proposed, in case of extremity,\r\nto defend the most seriously threatened barricades by tiring them with\r\npitch brands; at the mere word the provisional government had fallen\r\ninto a veritable state of panic. I let him go his way in order that I\r\nmight enjoy the privilege of a solitary person and reach the Town Hall\r\nby a short cut, and it was not until thirteen years later that I again\r\nset eyes upon him.\r\n\r\n [15] These words refer to the opening of the Ninth Symphony chorus:\r\n ‘Freude, Freude, Freude, schöner götterfunken Tochter aus\r\n Elysium’—(Praise her, praise oh praise Joy, the god-descended daughter\r\n of Elysium.) English version by Natalia Macfarren.—Editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Town Hall I learned from Bakunin that the provisional government\r\nhad passed a resolution, on his advice, to abandon the position in\r\nDresden, which had been entirely neglected from the beginning, and was\r\nconsequently quite untenable for any length of time. This resolution\r\nproposed an armed retreat to the Erzgebirge, where it would be possible\r\nto concentrate the reinforcements pouring in from all sides, especially\r\nfrom Thuringia, in such strength, that the advantageous position could\r\nbe used to inaugurate a German civil war that would sound no hesitating\r\nnote at its outset. To persist in defending isolated barricaded streets\r\nin Dresden could, on the other hand, lend little but the character of\r\nan urban riot to the contest, although it was pursued with the highest\r\ncourage. I must confess that this idea seemed to me magnificent and\r\nfull of meaning. Up to this moment I had been moved only by a feeling\r\nof sympathy for a method of procedure entered upon at first with almost\r\nironical incredulity, and then pursued with the vigour of surprise.\r\nNow, however, all that had before seemed incomprehensible, unfolded\r\nitself before my vision in the form of a great and hopeful solution.\r\nWithout either feeling that I was in any way being compelled, or that\r\nit was my vocation to get some part or function allotted to me in these\r\nevents, I now definitely abandoned all consideration for my personal\r\nsituation, and determined to surrender myself to the stream of\r\ndevelopments which flowed in the direction towards which my feelings\r\nhad driven me with a delight that was full of despair. Still, I did not\r\nwish to leave my wife helpless in Dresden, and I rapidly devised a\r\nmeans of drawing her into the path which I had chosen, without\r\nimmediately informing her of what my resolve meant. During my hasty\r\nreturn to Friedrichstadt I recognised that this portion of the town had\r\nbeen almost entirely cut off from the inner city by the occupation of\r\nthe Prussian troops; I saw in my mind’s eye our own suburb occupied,\r\nand the consequences of a state of military siege in their most\r\nrepulsive light. It was an easy job to persuade Minna to accompany me\r\non a visit, by way of the Tharanderstrasse, which was still free, to\r\nChemnitz, where my married sister Clara lived. It was only a matter of\r\na moment for her to arrange her household orders, and she promised to\r\nfollow me to the next village in an hour with the parrot. I went on in\r\nadvance with my little dog Peps, in order to hire a carriage in which\r\nto proceed on our journey to Chemnitz. It was a smiling spring morning\r\nwhen I traversed for the last time the paths I had so often trod on my\r\nlonely walks, with the knowledge that I should never wander along them\r\nagain. While the larks were soaring to dizzy heights above my head, and\r\nsinging in the furrows of the fields, the light and heavy artillery did\r\nnot cease to thunder down the streets of Dresden. The noise of this\r\nshooting, which had continued uninterruptedly for several days, had\r\nhammered itself so indelibly upon my nerves, that it continued to\r\nre-echo for a long time in my brain; just as the motion of the ship\r\nwhich took me to London had made me stagger for some time afterwards.\r\nAccompanied by this terrible music, I threw my parting greeting to the\r\ntowers of the city that lay behind me, and said to myself with a smile,\r\nthat if, seven years ago, my entry had taken place under thoroughly\r\nobscure auspices, at all events my exit was conducted with some show of\r\npomp and ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhen at last I found myself with Minna in a one-horse carriage on the\r\nway to the Erzgebirge, we frequently met armed reinforcements on their\r\nway to Dresden. The sight of them always kindled an involuntary joy in\r\nus; even my wife could not refrain from addressing words of\r\nencouragement to the men; at present it seemed not a single barricade\r\nhad been lost. On the other hand, a gloomy impression was made upon us\r\nby a company of regulars which was making its way towards Dresden in\r\nsilence. We asked some of them whither they were bound; and their\r\nanswer, ‘To do their duty,’ had been obviously impressed upon them by\r\ncommand. At last we reached my relations in Chemnitz. I terrified all\r\nthose near and dear to me when I declared my intention to return to\r\nDresden on the following day at the earliest possible hour, in order to\r\nascertain how things were going there. In spite of all attempts to\r\ndissuade me, I carried out my decision, pursued by a suspicion that I\r\nshould meet the armed forces of the Dresden people on the country\r\nhighroad in the act of retreat. The nearer I approached the capital,\r\nthe stronger became the confirmation of the rumours that, as yet, there\r\nwas no thought in Dresden of surrender or withdrawal, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, the contest was proving very favourable for the national\r\nparty. All this appeared to me like one miracle after another. On this\r\nday, Tuesday, 9th of May, I once more forced my way in a high state of\r\nexcitement over ground which had become more and more inaccessible. All\r\nthe highways had to be avoided, and it was only possible to make\r\nprogress through such houses as had been broken through. At last I\r\nreached the Town Hall in the Altstadt, just as night was falling. A\r\ntruly terrible spectacle met my eyes, for I crossed those parts of the\r\ntown in which preparations had been made for a house-to-house fight.\r\nThe incessant groaning of big and small guns reduced to an uncanny\r\nmurmur all the other sounds that came from armed men ceaselessly crying\r\nout to one another from barricade to barricade, and from one house to\r\nanother, which they had broken through. Pitch brands burnt here and\r\nthere, pale-faced figures lay prostrate around the watch-posts, half\r\ndead with fatigue, and any unarmed wayfarer forcing a path for himself\r\nwas sharply challenged. Nothing, however, that I have lived through can\r\nbe compared with the impression that I received on my entry into the\r\nchambers of the Town Hall. Here was a gloomy, and yet fairly compact\r\nand serious mass of people; a look of unspeakable fatigue was upon all\r\nfaces; not a single voice had retained its natural tone. There was a\r\nhoarse jumble of conversation inspired by a state of the highest\r\ntension. The only familiar sight that survived was to be found in the\r\nold servants of the Town Hall in their curious antiquated uniform and\r\nthree-cornered hats. These tall men, at other times an object of\r\nconsiderable fear, I found engaged partly in buttering pieces of bread,\r\nand cutting slices of ham and sausage, and partly in piling into\r\nbaskets immense stores of provisions for the messengers sent by the\r\ndefenders of the barricades for supplies. These men had turned into\r\nveritable nursing mothers of the revolution.\r\n\r\nAs I proceeded further, I came at last upon the members of the\r\nprovisional government, among whom Todt and Tschirner, after their\r\nfirst panic-stricken flight, were once more to be found gliding to and\r\nfro, gloomy as spectres, now that they were chained to the performance\r\nof their heavy duties. Heubner alone had preserved his full energy; but\r\nhe was a really piteous sight: a ghostly fire burned in his eyes which\r\nhad not had a wink of sleep for seven nights. He was delighted to see\r\nme again, as he regarded my arrival as a good omen for the cause which\r\nhe was defending; while on the other hand, in the rapid succession of\r\nevents, he had come into contact with elements about which no\r\nconclusion could shape itself to his complete satisfaction. I found\r\nBakunin’s outlook undisturbed, and his attitude firm and quiet. He did\r\nnot show the smallest change in his appearance, in spite of having had\r\nno sleep during the whole time, which I afterwards heard was a fact.\r\nWith a cigar in his mouth he received me, seated on one of the\r\nmattresses which lay distributed over the floor of the Town Hall. At\r\nhis side was a very young Pole (a Galician) named Haimberger, a\r\nviolinist whom he had once asked me to recommend to Lipinsky, in order\r\nthat he might give him lessons, as he did not want this raw and\r\ninexperienced boy, who had become passionately attached to him, to get\r\ndrawn into the vortex of the present upheavals. Now that Haimberger had\r\nshouldered a gun, and presented himself for service at the barricades,\r\nhowever, Bakunin had greeted him none the less joyfully. He had drawn\r\nhim down to sit by his side on the couch, and every time the youth\r\nshuddered with fear at the violent sound of the cannon-shot, he slapped\r\nhim vigorously on the back and cried out: ‘You are not in the company\r\nof your fiddle here, my friend. What a pity you didn’t stay where you\r\nwere!’ Bakinin then gave me a short and precise account of what had\r\nhappened since I had left him on the previous morning. The retreat\r\nwhich had then been decided upon soon proved unadvisable, as it would\r\nhave discouraged the numerous reinforcements which had already arrived\r\non that day. Moreover, the desire for fighting had been so great, and\r\nthe force of the defenders so considerable, that it had been possible\r\nto oppose the enemy’s troops successfully so far. But as the latter had\r\nalso got large reinforcements, they again had been able to make an\r\neffective combined attack on the strong Wildstruf barricade. The\r\nPrussian troops had avoided fighting in the streets, choosing instead\r\nthe method of fighting from house to house by breaking through the\r\nwalls. This had made it clear that all defence by barricades had become\r\nuseless, and that the enemy would succeed slowly but surely in drawing\r\nnear the Town Hall, the seat of the provisional government. Bakunin had\r\nnow proposed that all the powder stores should be brought together in\r\nthe lower rooms of the Town Hall, and that on the approach of the enemy\r\nit should be blown up. The town council, who were still in consultation\r\nin a back room, had remonstrated with the greatest vehemence. Bakunin,\r\nhowever, had insisted with great firmness on the execution of the\r\nmeasure, but in the end had been completely outwitted by the removal of\r\nall the powder stores. Moreover, Heubner, to whom Bakunin could refuse\r\nnothing, had been won over to the other side. It was now decided that\r\nas everything was ready, the retreat to the Erzgebirge, which had\r\noriginally been intended for the previous day, should be fixed for the\r\nearly morrow. Young Zichlinsky had already received orders to cover the\r\nroad to Plauen so as to make it strategically safe. When I inquired\r\nafter Röckel, Bakunin replied swiftly that he had not been seen since\r\nthe previous evening, and that he had most likely allowed himself to be\r\ncaught: he was in such a nervous state. I now gave an account of what I\r\nhad observed on my way to and from Chemnitz, describing the great\r\nmasses of reinforcements, amongst which was the communal guard of that\r\nplace, several thousands strong. In Freiberg I had met four hundred\r\nreservists, who had come in excellent form to back the citizen army,\r\nbut could not proceed further, as they were tired out by their forced\r\nmarch. It seemed obvious that this was a case in which the necessary\r\nenergy to requisition wagons had been lacking, and that if the bounds\r\nof loyalty were transgressed in this matter, the advent of fresh forces\r\nwould be considerably promoted. I was begged to make my way back at\r\nonce, and convey the opinion of the provisional government to the\r\npeople whose acquaintance I had made. My old friend Marschall von\r\nBieberstein immediately proposed to accompany me. I welcomed his offer,\r\nas he was an officer of the provisional government, and was\r\nconsequently more fitted than I was to communicate orders. This man,\r\nwho had been almost extravagant in his enthusiasm before, was now\r\nutterly exhausted by sleeplessness, and unable to emit another word\r\nfrom his hoarse throat. He now made his way with me from the Town Hall\r\nto his house in the suburb of Plauen by the devious ways that had been\r\nindicated to us, in order to requisition a carriage for our purpose\r\nfrom a coachman he knew, and to bid farewell to his family, from whom\r\nhe assumed he would in all probability have to separate himself for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\nWhile we were waiting for the coachman we had tea and supper, talking\r\nthe while, in a fairly calm and composed manner, with the ladies of the\r\nhouse. We arrived at Freiberg early the following morning, after\r\nvarious adventures, and I set out forthwith to find the leaders of the\r\nreservist contingent with whom I was already acquainted. Marschall\r\nadvised them to requisition horses and carts in the villages wherever\r\nthey could do so. When they had all set off in marching order for\r\nDresden, and while I was feeling impelled by my passionate interest in\r\nthe fate of that city to return to it once more, Marschall conceived\r\nthe desire to carry his commission further afield, and for this purpose\r\nasked to be allowed to leave me. Whereupon I again turned my back on\r\nthe heights of the Erzgebirge, and was travelling by special coach in\r\nthe direction of Tharand, when I too was overcome with sleep, and was\r\nonly awakened by violent shouts and the sound of some one holding a\r\nparley with the postillion. On opening my eyes I found, to my\r\nastonishment, that the road was filled with armed revolutionaries\r\nmarching, not towards, but away from Dresden, and some of them were\r\ntrying to commandeer the coach to relieve their weariness on the way\r\nback.\r\n\r\n‘What is the matter?’ I cried. ‘Where are you going?’\r\n\r\n‘Home,’ was the reply. ‘It is all over in Dresden. The provincial\r\ngovernment is close behind us in that carriage down there.’\r\n\r\nI shot out of the coach like a dart, leaving it at the disposal of the\r\ntired men, and hurried on, down the steeply sloping road, to meet the\r\nill-fated party. And there I actually found them—Heubner, Bakunin, and\r\nMartin, the energetic post-office clerk, the two latter armed with\r\nmuskets—in a smart hired carriage from Dresden which was coming slowly\r\nup the hill. On the box were, as I supposed, the secretaries, while as\r\nmany as possible of the weary National Guard struggled for seats\r\nbehind. I hastened to swing myself into the coach, and so came in for a\r\nconversation which thereupon took place between the driver, who was\r\nalso the owner of the coach, and the provisional government. The man\r\nwas imploring them to spare his carriage, which, he said, was very\r\nlightly sprung and quite unequal to carrying such a load; he begged\r\nthat the people should be told not to seat themselves behind and in\r\nfront. But Bakunin remained quite unconcerned, and elected to give me a\r\nshort account of the retreat from Dresden, which had been successfully\r\nachieved without loss. He had had the trees in the newly planted\r\nMaximilian Avenue felled early in the morning to form a barricade\r\nagainst a possible flank attack of cavalry, and had been immensely\r\nentertained by the lamentations of the inhabitants, who during the\r\nprocess did nothing but bewail their _Scheene Beeme_.[16] All this time\r\nour driver’s lamentations over his coach were growing more importunate.\r\nFinally he broke into loud sobs and tears, upon which Bakunin,\r\nregarding him with positive pleasure, called out: ‘The tears of a\r\nPhilistine are nectar for the gods.’ He would not vouchsafe him a word,\r\nbut Heubner and I found the scene tiresome, whereupon he asked me\r\nwhether we two at least should not get out, as he could not ask it of\r\nthe others. As a matter of fact, it was high time to leave the coach,\r\nas some new contingents of revolutionaries had formed up in rank and\r\nfile all along the highway to salute the provisional government and\r\nreceive orders. Heubner strode down the line with great dignity,\r\nacquainted the leaders with the state of affairs, and exhorted them to\r\nkeep their trust in the righteousness of the cause for which so many\r\nhad shed their blood. All were now to retire to Freiberg, there to\r\nawait further orders.\r\n\r\n [16] Saxon corruption of _schöne Bäume_, beautiful trees.—EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nA youngish man of serious mien now stepped forward from the ranks of\r\nthe rebels to place himself under the special protection of the\r\nprovisional government. He was a certain Menzdorff, a German Catholic\r\npriest whom I had had the advantage of meeting in Dresden. (It was he\r\nwho, in the course of a significant conversation, had first induced me\r\nto read Feuerbach.) He had been dragged along as a prisoner and\r\nabominably treated by the Chemnitz municipal guard on this particular\r\nmarch, having originally been the instigator of a demonstration to\r\nforce that body to take up arms and march to Dresden. He owed his\r\nfreedom only to the chance meeting with other better disposed volunteer\r\ncorps. We saw this Chemnitz town guard ourselves, stationed far away on\r\na hill. They sent representatives to beseech Heubner to tell them how\r\nthings stood. When they had received the information required, and had\r\nbeen told that the fight would be continued in a determined manner,\r\nthey invited the provisional government to quarter at Chemnitz. As soon\r\nas they rejoined their main body we saw them wheel round and turn back.\r\n\r\nWith many similar interruptions the somewhat disorganised procession\r\nreached Freiberg. Here some friends of Heubner’s came to meet him in\r\nthe streets with the urgent request not to plunge their native place\r\ninto the misery of desperate street-fighting by establishing the\r\nprovisional government there. Heubner made no reply to this, but\r\nrequested Bakunin and myself to accompany him into his house for a\r\nconsultation. First we had to witness the painful meeting between\r\nHeubner and his wife; in a few words he pointed out the gravity and\r\nimportance of the task assigned to him, reminding her that it was for\r\nGermany and the high destiny of his country that he was staking his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was then prepared, and after the meal, during which a fairly\r\ncheerful mood prevailed, Heubner made a short speech to Bakunin,\r\nspeaking quietly but firmly. ‘My dear Bakunin,’ he said (his previous\r\nacquaintance with Bakunin was so slight that he did not even know how\r\nto pronounce his name), ‘before we decide anything further, I must ask\r\nyou to state clearly whether your political aim is really the Red\r\nRepublic, of which they tell me you are a partisan. Tell me frankly, so\r\nthat I may know if I can rely on your friendship in the future?’\r\n\r\nBakunin explained briefly that he had no scheme for any political form\r\nof government, and would not risk his life for any of them. As for his\r\nown far-reaching desires and hopes, they had nothing whatever to do\r\nwith the street-fighting in Dresden and all that this implied for\r\nGermany. He had looked upon the rising in Dresden as a foolish,\r\nludicrous movement until he realised the effect of Heubner’s noble and\r\ncourageous example. From that moment every political consideration and\r\naim had been put in the background by his sympathy with this heroic\r\nattitude, and he had immediately resolved to assist this excellent man\r\nwith all the devotion and energy of a friend. He knew, of course, that\r\nhe belonged to the so-called moderate party, of whose political future\r\nhe was not able to form an opinion, as he had not profited much by his\r\nopportunities of studying the position of the various parties in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nHeubner declared himself satisfied by this reply, and proceeded to ask\r\nBakunin’s opinion of the present state of things—whether it would not\r\nbe conscientious and reasonable to dismiss the men and give up a\r\nstruggle which might be considered hopeless. In reply Bakunin insisted,\r\nwith his usual calm assurance, that whoever else threw up the sponge,\r\nHeubner must certainly not do so. He had been the first member of the\r\nprovisional government, and it was he who had given the call to arms.\r\nThe call had been obeyed, and hundreds of lives had been sacrificed; to\r\nscatter the people again would look as if these sacrifices had been\r\nmade to idle folly. Even if they were the only two left, they still\r\nought not to forsake their posts. If they went under their lives might\r\nbe forfeit, but their honour must remain unsullied, so that a similar\r\nappeal in the future might not drive every one to despair.\r\n\r\nThis was quite enough for Heubner. He at once made out a summons for\r\nthe election of a representative assembly for Saxony, to be held at\r\nChemnitz. He thought that, with the assistance of the populace and of\r\nthe numerous insurgent bands who were arriving from all quarters, he\r\nwould be able to hold the town as the headquarters of a provisional\r\ngovernment until the general situation in Germany had become more\r\nsettled. In the midst of these discussions, Stephan Born walked into\r\nthe room to report that he had brought the armed bands right into\r\nFreiberg, in good order and without any losses. This young man was a\r\ncompositor who had contributed greatly to Heubner’s peace of mind\r\nduring the last three days in Dresden by taking over the chief command.\r\nHis simplicity of manner made a very encouraging impression on us,\r\nparticularly when we heard his report. When, however, Heubner asked\r\nwhether he would undertake to defend Freiberg against the troops which\r\nmight be expected to attack at any moment, he declared that this was an\r\nexperienced officer’s job, and that he himself was no soldier and knew\r\nnothing of strategy. Under these circumstances it seemed better, if\r\nonly to gain time, to fall back on the more thickly populated town of\r\nChemnitz. The first thing to be done, however, was to see that the\r\nrevolutionaries, who were assembled in large numbers at Freiberg, were\r\nproperly cared for, and Born went off immediately to make preliminary\r\narrangements. Heubner also took leave of us, and went to refresh his\r\ntired brain by an hour’s sleep. I was left alone on the sofa with\r\nBakunin, who soon fell towards me, overcome by irresistible drowsiness,\r\nand dropped the terrific weight of his head on to my shoulder. As I saw\r\nthat he would not wake if I shook off this burden, I pushed him aside\r\nwith some difficulty, and took leave both of the sleeper and of\r\nHeubner’s house; for I wished to see for myself, as I had done for many\r\ndays past, what course these extraordinary events were taking. I\r\ntherefore went to the Town Hall, where I found the townspeople\r\nentertaining to the best of their ability a blustering horde of excited\r\nrevolutionaries both within and without the walls. To my surprise, I\r\nfound Heubner there in the full swing of work. I thought he was asleep\r\nat home, but the idea of leaving the people even for an hour without a\r\ncounsellor had driven away all thought of rest. He had lost no time in\r\nsuperintending the organisation of a sort of commandant’s office, and\r\nwas again occupied with drafting and signing documents in the midst of\r\nthe uproar that raged on all sides. It was not long before Bakunin too\r\nput in an appearance, principally in search of a good officer—who was\r\nnot, however, forthcoming. The commandant of a large contingent from\r\nthe Vogtland, an oldish man, raised Bakunin’s hopes by the impassioned\r\nenergy of his speeches, and he would have had him appointed\r\ncommandant-general on the spot. But it seemed as if any real decision\r\nwere impossible in that frenzy and confusion, and as the only hope of\r\nmastering it seemed to be in reaching Chemnitz, Heubner gave the order\r\nto march on towards that town as soon as every one had had food. Once\r\nthis was settled, I told my friends I should go on in advance of their\r\ncolumn to Chemnitz, where I should find them again next day; for I\r\nlonged to be quit of this chaos. I actually caught the coach, the\r\ndeparture of which was fixed for that time, and obtained a seat in it.\r\nBut the revolutionaries were just marching off on the same road, and we\r\nwere told that we must wait until they had passed to avoid being caught\r\nin the whirlpool. This meant considerable delay, and for a long while I\r\nwatched the peculiar bearing of the patriots as they marched out. I\r\nnoticed in particular a Vogtland regiment, whose marching step was\r\nfairly orthodox, following the beat of a drummer who tried to vary the\r\nmonotony of his instrument in an artistic manner by hitting the wooden\r\nframe alternately with the drumhead. The unpleasant rattling tone thus\r\nproduced reminded me in ghostly fashion of the rattling of the\r\nskeletons’ bones in the dance round the gallows by night which Berlioz\r\nhad brought home to my imagination with such terrible realism in his\r\nperformance of the last movement of his Sinfonie Fantastique in Paris.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the desire seized me to look up the friends I had left behind,\r\nand travel to Chemnitz in their company if possible. I found they had\r\nquitted the Town Hall, and on reaching Heubner’s house I was told that\r\nhe was asleep. I therefore went back to the coach, which, however, was\r\nstill putting off its departure, as the road was blocked with troops. I\r\nwalked nervously up and down for some time, then, losing faith in the\r\njourney by coach, I went back again to Heubner’s house to offer myself\r\ndefinitely as a travelling companion. But Heubner and Bakunin had\r\nalready left home, and I could find no traces of them. In desperation I\r\nreturned once more to the coach, and found it by this time really ready\r\nto start. After various delays and adventures it brought me late at\r\nnight to Chemnitz, where I got out and betook myself to the nearest\r\ninn. At five o’clock the next morning I got up (after a few hours’\r\nsleep) and set out to find my brother-in-law Wolfram’s house, which was\r\nabout a quarter of an hour’s walk from the town. On the way I asked a\r\nsentinel of the town guard whether he knew anything about the arrival\r\nof the provisional government.\r\n\r\n‘Provisional government?’ was the reply. ‘Why, it’s all up with that.’\r\nI did not understand him, nor was I able to learn anything about the\r\nstate of things when I first reached the house of my relatives, for my\r\nbrother-in-law had been sent into the town as special constable. It was\r\nonly on his return home, lute in the afternoon, that I heard what had\r\ntaken place in one hotel at Chemnitz while I had been resting in\r\nanother inn. Heubner, Bakunin, and the man called Martin, whom I have\r\nmentioned already, had, it seemed, arrived before me in a hackney-coach\r\nat the gates of Chemnitz. On being asked for their names Heubner had\r\nannounced himself in a tone of authority, and had bidden the town\r\ncouncillors come to him at a certain hotel. They had no sooner reached\r\nthe hotel than they all three collapsed from excessive fatigue.\r\nSuddenly the police broke into the room and arrested them in the name\r\nof the local government, upon which they only begged to have a few\r\nhours’ quiet sleep, pointing out that flight was out of the question in\r\ntheir present condition. I heard further that they had been removed to\r\nAltenburg under a strong military escort. My brother-in-law was obliged\r\nto confess that the Chemnitz municipal guard, which had been forced to\r\nstart for Dresden much against its will, and had resolved at the very\r\noutset to place itself at the disposal of the royal forces on arriving\r\nthere, had deceived Heubner by inviting him to Chemnitz, and had lured\r\nhim into the trap. They had reached Chemnitz long before Heubner, and\r\nhad taken over the guard at the gates with the object of seeing him\r\narrive and of preparing for his arrest at once. My brother-in-law had\r\nbeen very anxious about me too, as he had been told in furious tones by\r\nthe leaders of the town guard that I had been seen in close association\r\nwith the revolutionaries. He thought it a wonderful intervention of\r\nProvidence that I had not arrived at Chemnitz with them and gone to the\r\nsame inn, in which case their fate would certainly have been mine. The\r\nrecollection of my escape from almost certain death in duels with the\r\nmost experienced swordsmen in my student days flashed across me like a\r\nflash of lightning. This last terrible experience made such an\r\nimpression on me that I was incapable of breathing a word in connection\r\nwith what had happened. My brother-in-law, in response to urgent\r\nappeals—from my wife in particular, who was much concerned for my\r\npersonal safety—undertook to convey me to Altenburg in his carriage by\r\nnight. From there I continued my journey by coach to Weimar, where I\r\nhad originally planned to spend my holidays, little thinking that I\r\nshould arrive by such devious ways.\r\n\r\nThe dreamy unreality of my state of mind at this time is best explained\r\nby the apparent seriousness with which, on meeting Liszt again, I at\r\nonce began to discuss what seemed to be the sole topic of any real\r\ninterest to him in connection with me—the forthcoming revival of\r\nTannhäuser at Weimar. I found it very difficult to confess to this\r\nfriend that I had not left Dresden in the regulation way for a\r\nconductor of the royal opera. To tell the truth, I had a very hazy\r\nconception of the relation in which I stood to the law of my country\r\n(in the narrow sense). Had I done anything criminal in the eye of the\r\nlaw or not? I found it impossible to come to any conclusion about it.\r\nMeanwhile, alarming news of the terrible conditions in Dresden\r\ncontinued to pour into Weimar. Genast, the stage manager, in\r\nparticular, aroused great excitement by spreading the report that\r\nRöckel, who was well known at Weimar, had been guilty of arson. Liszt\r\nmust soon have gathered from my conversation, in which I did not take\r\nthe trouble to dissimulate, that I too was suspiciously connected with\r\nthese terrible events, though my attitude with regard to them misled\r\nhim for some time. For I was not by any means prepared to proclaim\r\nmyself a combatant in the recent fights, and that for reasons quite\r\nother than would have seemed valid in the eyes of the law. My friend\r\nwas therefore encouraged in his delusion by the unpremeditated effect\r\nof my attitude. When we met at the house of Princess Caroline of\r\nWittgenstein, to whom I had been introduced the year before when she\r\npaid her flying visit to Dresden, we were able to hold stimulating\r\nconversations on all sorts of artistic topics. One afternoon, for\r\ninstance, a lively discussion sprang up from a description I had given\r\nof a tragedy to be entitled Jesus of Nazareth. Liszt maintained a\r\ndiscreet silence after I had finished, whereas the Princess protested\r\nvigorously against my proposal to bring such a subject on to the stage.\r\nFrom the lukewarm attempt I made to support the paradoxical theories I\r\nhad put forward, I realised the state of my mind at that time. Although\r\nit was not very evident to onlookers, I had been, and still was, shaken\r\nto the very depths of my being by my recent experiences.\r\n\r\nIn due course an orchestral rehearsal of Tannhäuser took place, which\r\nin various ways stimulated the artist in me afresh. Liszt’s conducting,\r\nthough mainly concerned with the musical rather than the dramatic side,\r\nfilled me for the first time with the flattering warmth of emotion\r\nroused by the consciousness of being understood by another mind in full\r\nsympathy with my own. At the same time I was able, in spite of my\r\ndreamy condition, to observe critically the standard of capacity\r\nexhibited by the singers and their chorus-master. After the rehearsal\r\nI, together with the musical director, Stohr, and Götze the singer,\r\naccepted Liszt’s invitation to a simple dinner, at a different inn from\r\nthe one where he lived. I thus had occasion to take alarm at a trait in\r\nhis character which was entirely new to me. After being stirred up to a\r\ncertain pitch of excitement his mood became positively alarming, and he\r\nalmost gnashed his teeth in a passion of fury directed against a\r\ncertain section of society which had also aroused my deepest\r\nindignation. I was strongly affected by this strange experience with\r\nthis wonderful man, but I was unable to see the association of ideas\r\nwhich had led to his terrible outburst. I was therefore left in a state\r\nof amazement, while Liszt had to recover during the night from a\r\nviolent attack of nerves which his excitement had produced. Another\r\nsurprise was in store for me the next morning, when I found my friend\r\nfully equipped for a journey to Karlsruhe—the circumstances which made\r\nit necessary being absolutely incomprehensible to me. Liszt invited\r\nDirector Stohr and myself to accompany him as far as Eisenach. On our\r\nway there we were stopped by Beaulieu, the Lord Chamberlain, who wished\r\nto know whether I was prepared to be received by the Grand Duchess of\r\nWeimar, a sister of the Emperor Nicolas, at Eisenach castle. As my\r\nexcuse on the score of unsuitable travelling costume was not admitted,\r\nLiszt accepted in my name, and I really met with a surprisingly kind\r\nreception that evening from the Grand Duchess, who chatted with me in\r\nthe friendliest way, and introduced me to her chamberlain with all due\r\nceremony. Liszt maintained afterwards that his noble patroness had been\r\ninformed that I should be wanted by the authorities in Dresden within\r\nthe next few days, and had therefore hastened to make my personal\r\nacquaintance at once, knowing that it would compromise her too heavily\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\nLiszt continued his journey from Eisenach, leaving me to be entertained\r\nand looked after by Stohr and the musical director Kuhmstedt, a\r\ndiligent and skilful master of counterpoint with whom I paid my first\r\nvisit to the Wartburg, which had not then been restored. I was filled\r\nwith strange musings as to my fate when I visited this castle. Here I\r\nwas actually on the point of entering, for the first time, the building\r\nwhich was so full of meaning for me; here, too, I had to tell myself\r\nthat the days of my further sojourn in Germany were numbered. And in\r\nfact the news from Dresden, when we returned to Weimar the next day,\r\nwas serious indeed. Liszt, on his return on the third day, found a\r\nletter from my wife, who had not dared to write direct to me. She\r\nreported that the police had searched my house in Dresden, to which she\r\nhad returned, and that she had, moreover been warned on no account to\r\nallow me to return to that city, as a warrant had been taken out\r\nagainst me, and I was shortly to be served with a writ and arrested.\r\nLiszt, who was now solely concerned for my personal safety, called in a\r\nfriend who had some experience of law, to consider what should be done\r\nto rescue me from the danger that threatened me. Von Watzdorf, the\r\nminister whom I had already visited, had been of opinion that I should,\r\nif required, submit quietly to being taken to Dresden, and that the\r\njourney would be made in a respectable private carriage. On the other\r\nhand, reports which had reached us of the brutal way in which the\r\nPrussian troops in Dresden had gone to work in applying the state of\r\nsiege were of so alarming a nature that Liszt and his friends in\r\ncouncil urged my speedy departure from Weimar, where it would be\r\nimpossible to protect me. But I insisted on taking leave of my wife,\r\nwhose anxiety was great, before leaving Germany, and begged to be\r\nallowed to stay a little longer at least in the neighbourhood of\r\nWeimar. This was taken into consideration, and Professor Siebert\r\nsuggested my taking temporary shelter with a friendly steward at the\r\nvillage of Magdala, which was three hours distant. I drove there the\r\nfollowing morning to introduce myself to this kind steward and\r\nprotector as Professor Werder from Berlin, who, with a letter of\r\nrecommendation from Professor Siebert, had come to turn his financial\r\nstudies to practical account in helping to administer these estates.\r\nHere in rural seclusion I spent three days, entertainment of a peculiar\r\nnature being provided by the meeting of a popular assembly, which\r\nconsisted of the remainder of the contingent of revolutionaries which\r\nhad marched off towards Dresden and had now returned in disorder. I\r\nlistened with curious feelings, amounting almost to contempt, to the\r\nspeeches on this occasion, which were of every kind and description. On\r\nthe second day of my stay my host’s wife came back from Weimar (where\r\nit was market-day) full of a curious tale: the composer of an opera\r\nwhich was being performed there on that very day had been obliged to\r\nleave Weimar suddenly because the warrant for his arrest had arrived\r\nfrom Dresden. My host, who had been let into my secret by Professor\r\nSeibert, asked playfully what his name was. As his wife did not seem to\r\nknow, he came to her assistance with the suggestion that perhaps it was\r\nRöckel whose name was familiar at Weimar.\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ she said, ‘Röckel, that was his name, quite right.’\r\n\r\nMy host laughed loudly, and said that he would not be so stupid as to\r\nlet them catch him, in spite of his opera.\r\n\r\nAt last, on 22nd May, my birthday, Minna actually arrived at Magdala.\r\nShe had hastened to Weimar on receiving my letter, and had proceeded\r\nfrom there according to instructions, bent on persuading me at all\r\ncosts to flee the country immediately and for good. No attempt to raise\r\nher to the level of my own mood was successful; she persisted in\r\nregarding me as an ill-advised, inconsiderate person who had plunged\r\nboth himself and her into the most terrible situation. It had been\r\narranged that I should meet her the next evening in the house of\r\nProfessor Wolff at Jena to take a last farewell. She was to go by way\r\nof Weimar, while I took the footpath from Magdala. I started\r\naccordingly on my walk of about six hours, and came over the plateau\r\ninto the little university town (which now received me hospitably for\r\nthe first time) at sunset. I found my wife again at the house of\r\nProfessor Wolff, who, thanks to Liszt, was already my friend, and with\r\nthe addition of a certain Professor Widmann another conference was held\r\non the subject of my further escape. A writ was actually out against me\r\nfor being strongly suspected of participation in the Dresden rising,\r\nand I could not under any circumstances depend on a safe refuge in any\r\nof the German federal states. Liszt insisted on my going to Paris,\r\nwhere I could find a new field for my work, while Widmann advised me\r\nnot to go by the direct route through Frankfort and Baden, as the\r\nrising was still in full swing there, and the police would certainly\r\nexercise praiseworthy vigilance over incoming travellers with\r\nsuspicious-looking passports. The way through Bavaria would be the\r\nsafest, as all was quiet there again; I could then make for\r\nSwitzerland, and the journey to Paris from there could be engineered\r\nwithout any danger. As I needed a passport for the journey, Professor\r\nWidmann offered me his own, which had been issued at Tubingen and had\r\nnot been brought up to date. My wife was quite in despair, and the\r\nparting from her caused me real pain. I set off in the mail-coach and\r\ntravelled, without further hindrance, through many towns (amongst them\r\nRudolstadt, a place full of memories for me) to the Bavarian frontier.\r\nFrom there I continued my journey by mail-coach straight to Lindau. At\r\nthe gates I, together with the other passengers, was asked for my\r\npassport. I passed the night in a state of strange, feverish\r\nexcitement, which lasted until the departure of the steamer on Lake\r\nConstance early in the morning. My mind was full of the Swabian\r\ndialect, as spoken by Professor Widmann, with whose passport I was\r\ntravelling. I pictured to myself my dealings with the Bavarian police\r\nshould I have to converse with them in accordance with the\r\nabove-mentioned irregularities in that document. A prey to feverish\r\nunrest, I spent the whole night trying to perfect myself in the Swabian\r\ndialect, but, as I was amused to find, without the smallest success. I\r\nhad braced myself to meet the crucial moment early the next morning,\r\nwhen the policeman came into my room and, not knowing to whom the\r\npassports belonged, gave me three at random to choose from. With joy in\r\nmy heart I seized my own, and dismissed the dreaded messenger in the\r\nmost friendly way. Once on board the steamer I realised with true\r\nsatisfaction that I had now stepped on to Swiss territory. It was a\r\nlovely spring morning; across the broad lake I could gaze at the Alpine\r\nlandscape as it spread itself before my eyes. When I stepped on to\r\nRepublican soil at Rorschach, I employed the first moments in writing a\r\nfew lines home to tell of my safe arrival in Switzerland and my\r\ndeliverance from all danger. The coach drive through the pleasant\r\ncountry of St. Gall to Zürich cheered me up wonderfully, and when I\r\ndrove down from Oberstrass into Zürich that evening, the last day in\r\nMay, at six o’clock, and saw for the first time the Glarner Alps that\r\nencircle the lake gleaming in the sunset, I at once resolved, though\r\nwithout being fully conscious of it, to avoid everything that could\r\nprevent my settling here.\r\n\r\nI had been the more willing to accept my friends’ suggestion to take\r\nthe Swiss route to Paris, as I knew I should find an old acquaintance,\r\nAlexander Muller, at Zürich. I hoped with his help to obtain a passport\r\nto France, as I was anxious not to arrive there as a political refugee.\r\nI had been on very friendly terms with Muller once upon a time at\r\nWurzburg. He had been settled at Zürich for a long time as a teacher of\r\nmusic; this I learned from a pupil of his, Wilhelm Baumgartner, who had\r\ncalled on me in Dresden some years back to bring me a greeting from\r\nthis old friend. On that occasion I entrusted the pupil with a copy of\r\nthe score of Tannhäuser for his master, by way of remembrance, and this\r\nkind attention had not fallen on barren soil: Muller and Baumgartner,\r\nwhom I visited forthwith, introduced me at once to Jacob Sulzer and\r\nFranz Hagenbuch, two cantonal secretaries who were the most likely,\r\namong all their good friends, to compass the immediate fulfilment of my\r\ndesire. These two people, who had been joined by a few intimates,\r\nreceived me with such respectful curiosity and sympathy that I felt at\r\nhome with them at once. The great assurance and moderation with which\r\nthey commented on the persecutions which had overtaken me, as seen from\r\ntheir usual simple republican standpoint, opened to me a conception of\r\ncivil life which seemed to lift me to an entirely new sphere. I felt so\r\nsafe and protected here, whereas in my own country I had, without quite\r\nrealising it, come to be considered a criminal owing to the peculiar\r\nconnection between my disgust at the public attitude towards art and\r\nthe general political disturbances. To prepossess the two secretaries\r\nentirely in my favour (one of them, Sulzer, had enjoyed an excellent\r\nclassical education), my friends arranged a meeting one evening at\r\nwhich I was to read my poem on the Death of Siegfried. I am prepared to\r\nswear that I never had more attentive listeners, among men, than on\r\nthat evening. The immediate effect of my success was the drawing up of\r\na fully valid federal passport for the poor German under warrant of\r\narrest, armed with which I started gaily on my journey to Paris after\r\nquite a short stay at Zürich. From Strassburg, where I was enthralled\r\nby the fascination of the world-famous minster, I travelled towards\r\nParis by what was then the best means of locomotion, the so-called\r\nmalle-poste. I remember a remarkable phenomenon in connection with this\r\nconveyance. Till then the noise of the cannonade and musketry in the\r\nfighting at Dresden had been persistently re-echoing in my ears,\r\nespecially in a half-waking condition; now the humming of the wheels,\r\nas we rolled rapidly along the highroad, cast such a spell upon me that\r\nfor the whole of the journey I seemed to hear the melody of Freude,\r\nschöner Götterfunken[17]  from the Ninth Symphony being played, as it\r\nwere, on deep bass instruments.\r\n\r\n [17] See note on page 486.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time of my entering Switzerland till my arrival in Paris my\r\nspirits, which had sunk into a dreamlike apathy, rose gradually to a\r\nlevel of freedom and comfort that I had never enjoyed before. I felt\r\nlike a bird in the air whose destiny is not to founder in a morass; but\r\nsoon after my arrival in Paris, in the first week of June, a very\r\npalpable reaction set in. I had had an introduction from Liszt to his\r\nformer secretary Belloni, who felt it his duty, in loyalty to the\r\ninstructions received, to put me into communication with a literary\r\nman, a certain Gustave Vaisse, with the object of being commissioned to\r\nwrite an opera libretto for production in Paris. I did not, however,\r\nmake the personal acquaintance of Vaisse. The idea did not please me,\r\nand I found sufficient excuse for warding off the negotiations by\r\nsaying I was afraid of the epidemic of cholera which was said to be\r\nraging in the city. I was staying in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette for\r\nthe sake of being near Belloni. Through this street funeral\r\nprocessions, announced by the muffled drum boats of the National Guard,\r\npassed practically every hour. Though the heat was stifling, I was\r\nstrictly forbidden to touch water, and was advised to exercise the\r\ngreatest precaution with regard to diet in every respect. Besides this\r\nweight of uneasiness on my spirits, the whole outward aspect of Paris,\r\nas it then appeared, had the most depressing effect on me. The motto,\r\nliberte, egalite, fraternite was still to be seen on all the public\r\nbuildings and other establishments, but, on the other hand, I was\r\nalarmed at seeing the first garcons caissiers making their way from the\r\nbank with their long money-sacks over their shoulders and their large\r\nportfolios in their hands. I had never met them so frequently as now,\r\njust when the old capitalist regime, after its triumphant struggle\r\nagainst the once dreaded socialist propaganda, was exerting itself\r\nvigorously to regain the public confidence by its almost insulting\r\npomp. I had gone, as it were, mechanically into Schlesinger’s\r\nmusic-shop, where a successor was now installed—a much more pronounced\r\ntype of Jew named Brandus, of a very dirty appearance. The only person\r\nthere to give me a friendly welcome was the old clerk, Monsieur Henri.\r\nAfter I had talked to him in loud tones for some time, as the shop was\r\napparently empty, he at length asked me with some embarrassment whether\r\nI had not seen my master (_votre maître_) Meyerbeer.\r\n\r\n‘Is Monsieur Meyerbeer here?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n‘Certainly,’ was the even more embarrassed reply; ‘quite near, over\r\nthere behind the desk.’\r\n\r\nAnd, sure enough, as I walked across to the desk Meyerbeer came out,\r\ncovered with confusion. He smiled and made some excuse about pressing\r\nproof-sheets. He had been hiding there quietly for over ten minutes\r\nsince first hearing my voice. I had had enough after my strange\r\nencounter with this apparition. It recalled so many things affecting\r\nmyself which reflected suspicion on the man, in particular the\r\nsignificance of his behaviour towards me in Berlin on the last\r\noccasion. However, as I had now nothing more to do with him, I greeted\r\nhim with a certain easy gaiety induced by the regret I felt at seeing\r\nhis manifest confusion on becoming cognisant of my arrival in Paris. He\r\ntook it for granted that I should again seek my fortune there, and\r\nseemed much surprised when I assured him, on the contrary, that the\r\nidea of having any work there was odious to me.\r\n\r\n‘But Liszt published such a brilliant article about you in the _Journal\r\ndes Débats_,’ he said.\r\n\r\n‘Ah,’ I replied, ‘it really had not occurred to me that the\r\nenthusiastic devotion of a friend should be regarded as a mutual\r\nspeculation.’\r\n\r\n‘But the article made a sensation. It is incredible that you should not\r\nseek to make any profit out of it.’\r\n\r\nThis offensive meddlesomeness roused me to protest to Meyerbeer with\r\nsome violence that I was concerned with anything rather than with the\r\nproduction of artistic work, particularly just at that time when the\r\ncourse of events seemed to indicate that the whole world was undergoing\r\na reaction.\r\n\r\n‘But what do you expect to get out of the revolution?’ he replied. ‘Are\r\nyou going to write scores for the barricades?’\r\n\r\nWhereupon I assured him that I was not thinking of writing any scores\r\nat all. We parted, obviously without having arrived at a mutual\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nIn the street I was also stopped by Moritz Schlesinger, who, being\r\nequally under the influence of Liszt’s brilliant article, evidently\r\nconsidered me a perfect prodigy. He too thought I must be counting on\r\nmaking a hit in Paris, and was sure that I had a very good chance of\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\n‘Will you undertake my business?’ I asked him. ‘I have no money. Do you\r\nreally think the performance of an opera by an unknown composer can be\r\nanything but a matter of money?’\r\n\r\n‘You are quite right,’ said Moritz, and left me on the spot.\r\n\r\nI turned from these disagreeable encounters in the plague-stricken\r\ncapital of the world to inquire the fate of my Dresden companions, for\r\nsome of those with whom I was intimate had also reached Paris, when I\r\ncalled on Desplechins, who had painted the scenery for Tannhäuser. I\r\nfound Semper there, who had, like myself, been deposited in this city.\r\nWe met again with no little pleasure, although we could not help\r\nsmiling at our grotesque situation. Semper had retired from the battle\r\nwhen the famous barricade, which he in his capacity of architect kept\r\nunder close observation, had been surrounded. (He thought it impossible\r\nfor it to be captured.) All the same, he considered that he had exposed\r\nhimself quite sufficiently to make it state of siege and were occupying\r\nDresden. He considered himself lucky as a native of Holstein to be\r\ndependent, not on the German, but on the Danish government for a\r\npassport, as this had helped him to reach Paris without difficulty.\r\nWhen I expressed my real and heartfelt regret at the turn of affairs\r\nwhich had torn him from a professional undertaking on which he had just\r\nstarted—the completion of the Dresden Museum—he refused to take it too\r\nseriously, saying it had given him a great deal of worry. In spite of\r\nour trying situation, it was with Semper that I spent the only bright\r\nhours of my stay in Paris. We were soon joined by another refugee,\r\nyoung Heine, who had once wished to paint my Lohengrin scenery. He had\r\nno qualms about his future, for his master Desplechins was willing to\r\ngive him employment. I alone felt I had been pitched quite aimlessly\r\ninto Paris. I had a passionate desire to leave this cholera-laden,\r\natmosphere, and Belloni offered me an opportunity which I promptly and\r\njoyfully seized. He invited me to follow himself and his family to a\r\ncountry place near La Ferte-sous-Jouarre, where I could be refreshed by\r\npure air and absolute quiet, and wait for a change for the better in my\r\nposition. I made the short journey to Rueil after another week in\r\nParis, and took for the time being a poor lodging (one room, built with\r\nrecesses) in the house of Monsieur Raphael, a wine merchant, close by\r\nthe village mairie where the Belloni family were staying. Here I waited\r\nfurther developments. During the period when all news from Germany\r\nceased I tried to occupy myself as far as possible with reading. After\r\ngoing through Proudhon’s writings, and in particular his De la\r\npropriete, in such a manner as to glean comfort for my situation in\r\ncuriously divers ways, I entertained myself for a considerable time\r\nwith Lamartine’s Histoire des Girondins, a most alluring and attractive\r\nwork. One day Belloni brought me news of the unfortunate rising in\r\nParis, which had been attempted on the 13th June by the Republicans\r\nunder Ledru-Rollin against the provisional government, which was then\r\nin the full tide of reaction. Great as was the indignation with which\r\nthe news was received by my host and the mayor of the place (a relative\r\nof his, at whose table we ate our modest daily meal), it made, on the\r\nwhole, little impression on me, as my attention was still fixed in\r\ngreat agitation on the events which were taking place on the Rhine, and\r\nparticularly on the grand-duchy of Baden, which had been made forfeit\r\nto a provisional government. When, however, the news reached me from\r\nthis quarter also that the Prussians had succeeded in subduing a\r\nmovement which had not at first seemed hopeless, I felt extraordinarily\r\ndowncast.\r\n\r\nI was compelled to consider my position carefully, and the necessity of\r\nconquering my difficulties helped to allay the excitement to which I\r\nwas a prey. The letters from my Weimar friends, as well as those from\r\nmy wife, now brought me completely to my senses. The former expressed\r\nthemselves very curtly about my behaviour with regard to recent events.\r\nThe opinion was, that for the moment there would be nothing for me to\r\ndo, and especially not in Dresden, or at the grand-ducal court, ‘as one\r\ncould not very well knock at battered doors’; ‘on ne frappe pas a des\r\nportes enfoncees’ (Princess von Wittgenstein to Belloni).\r\n\r\nI did not know what to reply, for I had never dreamt of expecting\r\nanything to come from their intervening on my behalf in that quarter;\r\nconsequently I was quite satisfied that they sent me temporarily\r\nfinancial assistance. With this money I made up my mind to leave for\r\nZürich and ask Alex Muller to give me shelter for a while, as his house\r\nwas sufficiently large to accommodate a guest. My saddest moment came\r\nwhen, after a long silence, I at last received a letter from my wife.\r\nShe wrote that she could not dream of living with me again; that after\r\nI had so unscrupulously thrown away a connection and position, the like\r\nof which would never again present itself to me, no woman could\r\nreasonably be expected to take any further interest in my future\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nI fully appreciated my wife’s unfortunate position; I could in no way\r\nassist her, except by advising her to sell our Dresden furniture, and\r\nby making an appeal on her behalf to my relatives in Leipzig.\r\n\r\nUntil then I had been able to think more lightly of the misery of her\r\nposition, simply because I had imagined her to be more deeply in\r\nsympathy with what agitated me. Often during the recent extraordinary\r\nevents I had even believed that she understood my feelings. Now,\r\nhowever, she had disillusioned me on this point: she could see in me no\r\nmore than what the public saw, and the one redeeming point of her\r\nsevere judgment was that she excused my behaviour on the score that I\r\nwas reckless. After I had begged Liszt to do what he could for my wife,\r\nI soon began to regard her unexpected behaviour with more equanimity.\r\nIn reply to her announcement that she would not write to me again for\r\nthe present, I said that I had also resolved to spare her all further\r\nanxiety about my very doubtful fate, by ceasing from communicating with\r\nher. I surveyed the panorama of our long years of association\r\ncritically in my mind’s eye, beginning with that first stormy year of\r\nour married life, that had been so full of sorrow. Our youthful days of\r\nworry and care in Paris had undoubtedly been of benefit to us both. The\r\ncourage and patience with which she had faced our difficulties, while I\r\non my part had tried to end them by dint of hard work, had linked us\r\ntogether with bonds of iron. Minna was rewarded for all these\r\nprivations by Dresden successes, and more especially by the highly\r\nenviable position I had held there. Her position as wife of the\r\nconductor (Frau Kapellmeisterin) had brought her the fulfilment of her\r\ndearest wishes, and all those things which conspired to make my work in\r\nthis official post so intolerable to me, were to her no more than so\r\nmany threats directed against her smug content. The course I had\r\nadopted with regard to Tannhäuser had already made her doubtful of my\r\nsuccess at the theatres, and had robbed her of all courage and\r\nconfidence in our future. The more I deviated from the path which she\r\nregarded as the only profitable one, due partly to the change of my\r\nviews (which I grew ever less willing to communicate to her), and\r\npartly to the modification in my attitude towards the stage, the more\r\nshe retreated from that position of close fellowship with me which she\r\nhad enjoyed in former years, and which she thought herself justified in\r\nconnecting in some way with my successes.\r\n\r\nShe looked upon my conduct with regard to the Dresden catastrophe as\r\nthe outcome of this deviation from the right path, and attributed it to\r\nthe influence of unscrupulous persons (particularly the unfortunate\r\nRöckel), who were supposed to have dragged me with them to ruin, by\r\nappealing to my vanity. Deeper than all these disagreements, however,\r\nwhich, after all, were concerned only with external circumstances, was\r\nthe consciousness of our fundamental incompatibility, which to me had\r\nbecome ever more and more apparent since the day of our reconciliation.\r\nFrom the very beginning we had had scenes of the most violent\r\ndescription: never once after these frequent quarrels had she admitted\r\nherself in the wrong or tried to be friends again.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of speedily restoring our domestic peace, as well as my\r\nconviction (confirmed by every one of her extravagant outbursts) that,\r\nin view of the great disparity of our characters and especially of our\r\neducations, it devolved upon me to prevent such scenes by observing\r\ngreat caution in my behaviour, always led me to take the entire blame\r\nfor what had happened upon myself, and to mollify Minna by showing her\r\nthat I was sorry. Unfortunately, and to my intense grief, I was forced\r\nto recognise that by acting in this way I lost all my power over her\r\naffections, and especially over her character. Now we stood in a\r\nposition in which I could not possibly resort to the same means of\r\nreconciliation, for it would have meant my being inconsistent in all my\r\nviews and actions. And then I found myself confronted by such hardness\r\nin the woman whom I had spoilt by my leniency, that it was out of the\r\nquestion to expect her to acknowledge the injustice done to myself.\r\nSuffice it to say that the wreck of my married life had contributed not\r\ninconsiderably to the ruin of my position in Dresden, and to the\r\ncareless manner in which I treated it, for instead of finding help,\r\nstrength, and consolation at home, I found my wife unwittingly\r\nconspiring against me, in league with all the other hostile\r\ncircumstances which then beset me. After I had got over the first shock\r\nof her heartless behaviour, I was absolutely clear about this. I\r\nremember that I did not suffer any great sorrow, but that on the\r\ncontrary, with the conviction of being now quite helpless, an almost\r\nexalted calm came over me when I realised that up to the present my\r\nlife had been built on a foundation of sand and nothing more. At all\r\nevents, the fact that I stood absolutely alone did much towards\r\nrestoring my peace of mind, and in my distress I now found strength and\r\ncomfort even in the fact of my dire poverty. At last assistance arrived\r\nfrom Weimar. I accepted it eagerly, and it was the means of extricating\r\nme from my present useless life and stranded hopes.\r\n\r\nMy next move was to find a place of refuge—one, however, which had but\r\nlittle attraction for me, seeing that in it there was not the slightest\r\nhope of my being able to make any further headway in the paths along\r\nwhich I had hitherto progressed. This refuge was Zürich, a town devoid\r\nof all art in the public sense, and where for the first time I met\r\nsimple-hearted people who knew nothing about me as a musician, but who,\r\nas it appeared, felt drawn towards me by the power of my personality\r\nalone. I arrived at Muller’s house and asked him to let me have a room,\r\nat the same time giving him what remained of my capital, namely twenty\r\nfrancs. I quickly discovered that my old friend was embarrassed by my\r\nperfectly open confidence in him, and that he was at his wit’s end to\r\nknow what to do with me. I soon gave up the large room containing a\r\ngrand piano, which he had allotted to me on the impulse of the moment,\r\nand retired to a modest little bedroom. The meals were my great trial,\r\nnot because I was fastidious, but because I could not digest thorn.\r\nOutside my friend’s house, on the contrary, I enjoyed what, considering\r\nthe habits of the locality, was the most luxurious reception. The same\r\nyoung men who had been so kind to me on my first journey through Zürich\r\nagain showed themselves anxious to be continually in my company, and\r\nthis was especially the case with one young fellow called Jakob Sulzer.\r\nHe had to be thirty years of age before he was entitled to become a\r\nmember of the Zürich government, and he therefore still had several\r\nyears to wait. In spite of his youth, however, the impression he made\r\non all those with whom he came in contact was that of a man of riper\r\nyears, whose character was formed. When I was asked long afterwards\r\nwhether I had ever met a man who, morally speaking, was the beau-ideal\r\nof real character and uprightness, I could, on reflection, think of\r\nnone other than this newly gained friend, Jakob Sulzer.\r\n\r\nHe owed his early appointment as permanent Cantonal Secretary\r\n(Staatsschreiber), one of the most excellent government posts in the\r\ncanton of Zürich, to the recently returned liberal party, led by Alfred\r\nEscher. As this party could not employ the more experienced members of\r\nthe older conservative side in the public offices, their policy was to\r\nchoose exceptionally gifted young men for these positions. Sulzer\r\nshowed extraordinary promise, and their choice accordingly soon lighted\r\non him. He had only just returned from the Berlin and Bonn universities\r\nwith the intention of establishing himself as professor of philology at\r\nthe university in his native town, when he was made a member of the new\r\ngovernment. To fit himself for his post he had to stay in Geneva for\r\nsix months to perfect himself in the French language, which he had\r\nneglected during his philological studies. He was quick-witted and\r\nindustrious, as well as independent and firm, and he never allowed\r\nhimself to be swayed by any party tactics. Consequently he rose very\r\nrapidly to high positions in the government, to which he rendered\r\nvaluable and important services, first as Minister of Finance, a post\r\nhe held for many years, and later with particular distinction as member\r\nof the School Federation. His unexpected acquaintance with me seemed to\r\nplace him in a sort of dilemma; from the philological and classical\r\nstudies which he had entered upon of his own choice, he suddenly found\r\nhimself torn away in the most bewildering manner by this unexpected\r\nsummons from the government. It almost seemed as if his meeting with me\r\nhad made him regret having accepted the appointment. As he was a person\r\nof great culture, my poem, Siegfried’s Death, naturally revealed to him\r\nmy knowledge of German antiquity. He had also studied this subject, but\r\nwith greater philological accuracy than I could possibly have aspired\r\nto. When, later on, he became acquainted with my manner of writing\r\nmusic, this peculiarly serious and reserved man became so thoroughly\r\ninterested in my sphere of art, so far removed from his own field of\r\nlabour, that, as he himself confessed, he felt it his duty to fight\r\nagainst these disturbing influences by being intentionally brusque and\r\ncurt with me. In the beginning of my stay in Zürich, however, he\r\ndelighted in being led some distance astray in the realms of art. The\r\nold-fashioned official residence of the first Cantonal Secretary was\r\noften the scene of unique gatherings, composed of people such as I\r\nwould be sure to attract. It might even be said that these social\r\nfunctions occurred rather more frequently than was advisable for the\r\nreputation of a civil servant of this little philistine state. What\r\nattracted the musician Baumgartner more particularly to these meetings\r\nwas the product of Sulzer’s vineyards in Winterthur, to which our hosts\r\ntreated his guests with the greatest liberality. When in my moods of\r\nmad exuberance I gave vent in dithyrambic effusions to my most extreme\r\nviews on art and life, my listeners often responded in a manner which,\r\nmore often than not, I was perfectly right in ascribing to the effects\r\nof the wine rather than to the power of my enthusiasm. Once when\r\nProfessor Ettmuller, the Germanist and Edda scholar, had been invited\r\nto listen to a reading of my Siegfried and had been led home in a state\r\nof melancholy enthusiasm, there was a regular outburst of wanton\r\nspirits among those who had remained behind. I conceived the absurd\r\nidea of lifting all the doors of the state official’s house off their\r\nhinges.\r\n\r\nHerr Hagenbuch, another servant of the state, seeing what exertion this\r\ncost me, offered me the help of his gigantic physique, and with\r\ncomparative ease we succeeded in removing every single door, and laying\r\nit aside, a proceeding at which Sulzer merely smiled good-naturedly.\r\nThe next day, however, when we made inquiries, he told us that the\r\nreplacing of those doors (which must have been a terrible strain on his\r\ndelicate constitution) had taken him the whole night, as he had made up\r\nhis mind to keep the knowledge of our orgies from the sergeant, who\r\nalways arrived at a very early hour in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary birdlike freedom of my existence had the effect of\r\nexciting me more and more. I was often frightened at the excessive\r\noutbursts of exaltation to which I was prone—no matter whom I was\r\nwith—and which led me to indulge in the most extraordinary paradoxes in\r\nmy conversation. Soon after I had settled in Zürich I began to write\r\ndown my various ideas about things at which I had arrived through my\r\nprivate and artistic experiences, as well as through the influence of\r\nthe political unrest of the day. As I had no choice but to try, to the\r\nbest of my ability, to earn something by my pen, I thought of sending a\r\nseries of articles to a great French journal such as the National,\r\nwhich in those days was still extant. In these articles I meant to\r\npropound my ideas (in my revolutionary way) on the subject of modern\r\nart in its relation to society. I sent six of them to an elderly friend\r\nof mine, Albert Franck, requesting him to have them translated into\r\nFrench and to get them published. This Franck was the brother of the\r\nbetter-known Hermann Franck, now the head of the Franco-German\r\nbookselling firm, which had originally belonged to my brother-in-law,\r\nAvenarius. He sent me back my work with the very natural remark that it\r\nwas out of the question to expect the Parisian public to understand or\r\nappreciate my articles, especially at such a critical moment.\r\n\r\nI headed the manuscript Kunst und Revolution (‘Art and Revolution’) and\r\nsent it to Otto Wigand in Leipzig, who actually undertook to publish it\r\nin the form of a pamphlet, and sent me five louis d’or for it. This\r\nunexpected success induced me to continue to exploit my literary gifts.\r\nI looked among my papers for the essay I had written the year before as\r\nthe outcome of my historical studies of the ‘Nibelungen’ legend; I gave\r\nit the title of Die Nibelungen Weltgeschichte aus der Sage, and again\r\ntried my luck by sending it to Wigand.\r\n\r\nThe sensational title of Kunst und Revolution, as well as the notoriety\r\nthe ‘royal conductor’ had gained as a political refugee, had made the\r\nradical publisher hope that the scandal that would arise on the\r\npublication of my articles would redound to his benefit! I soon\r\ndiscovered that he was on the point of issuing a second edition of\r\nKunst und Revolution, without, however, informing me of the fact. He\r\nalso took over my new pamphlet for another five louis d’or. This was\r\nthe first time I had earned money by means of published work, and I now\r\nbegan to believe that I had reached that point when I should be able to\r\nget the better of my misfortunes. I thought it over, and decided to\r\ngive public lectures in Zürich on subjects related to my writings\r\nduring the coming winter, hoping in that free and haphazard fashion to\r\nkeep body and soul together for a little while, although I had no fixed\r\nappointment and did not intend to work at music.\r\n\r\nIt seemed necessary for me to resort to these means, as I did not know\r\nhow otherwise to keep myself alive. Shortly after my arrival in Zürich\r\nI had witnessed the coming of the fragments of the Baden army,\r\ndispersed over Swiss territory, and accompanied by fugitive volunteers,\r\nand this had made a painful and uncanny impression upon me. The news of\r\nthe surrender near Villagos by Gorgey paralysed the last hopes as to\r\nthe issue of the great European struggle for liberty, which so far had\r\nbeen left quite undecided. With some misgiving and anxiety I now turned\r\nmy eyes from all these occurrences in the outside world inwards to my\r\nown soul.\r\n\r\nI was accustomed to patronise the cafe litteraire, where I took my\r\ncoffee after my heavy mid-day meal, in a smoky atmosphere surrounded by\r\na merry and joking throng of men playing dominoes and ‘fast.’ One day I\r\nstared at its common wall-paper representing antique subjects, which in\r\nsome inexplicable way recalled a certain water-colour by Genelli to my\r\nmind, portraying ‘The education of Dionysos by the Muses.’ I had seen\r\nit at the house of my brother-in-law Brockhaus in my young days, and it\r\nhad made a deep impression on me at the time. At this same place I\r\nconceived the first ideas of my Kunstwerk der Zukunft (‘The Art-Work of\r\nthe Future’), and it seemed a significant omen to me to be roused one\r\nday out of one of my post-prandial dreams by the news that\r\nSchroder-Devrient was staying in Zürich. I immediately got up with the\r\nintention of calling on her at the neighbouring hotel, ‘Zum Schwerte,’\r\nbut to my great dismay heard that she had just left by steamer. I never\r\nsaw her again, and long afterwards only heard of her painful death from\r\nmy wife, who in later years became fairly intimate with her in Dresden.\r\n\r\nAfter I had spent two remarkable summer months in this wild and\r\nextraordinary fashion, I at last received reassuring news of Minna, who\r\nhad remained in Dresden. Although her manner of taking leave of me had\r\nbeen both harsh and wounding, I could not bring myself to believe I had\r\ncompletely parted from her. In a letter I wrote to one of her\r\nrelations, and which I presumed they would forward, I made sympathetic\r\ninquiries about her, while I had already done all that lay in my power,\r\nthrough repeated appeals to Liszt, to ensure her being well cared for.\r\nI now received a direct reply, which, in addition to the fact that it\r\ntestified to the vigour and activity with which she had fought her\r\ndifficulties, at the same time showed me that she earnestly desired to\r\nbe reunited with me. It was almost in terms of contempt that she\r\nexpressed her grave doubts as to the possibility of my being able to\r\nmake a living in Zürich, but she added that, inasmuch as she was my\r\nwife, she wished to give me another chance. She also seemed to take it\r\nfor granted that I intended making Zürich only our temporary home, and\r\nthat I would do my utmost to promote my career as a composer of opera\r\nin Paris. Whereupon she announced her intention of arriving at\r\nRorschach in Switzerland on a certain date in September of that year,\r\nin the company of the little dog Peps, the parrot Papo, and her\r\nso-called sister Nathalie. After having engaged two rooms for our new\r\nhome, I now prepared to set out on foot for St. Gall and Rorschach\r\nthrough the lovely and celebrated Toggenburg and Appenzell, and felt\r\nvery touched after all when the peculiar family, which consisted half\r\nof pet animals, landed at the harbour of Rorschach. I must honestly\r\nconfess that the little dog and the bird made me very happy. My wife at\r\nonce threw cold water on my emotions, however, by declaring that in the\r\nevent of my behaving badly again she was ready to return to Dresden any\r\nmoment, and that she had numerous friends there, who would be glad to\r\nprotect and succour her if she were forced to carry out her threat. Be\r\nthis as it may, one look at her convinced me how greatly she had aged\r\nin this short time, and how much I ought to pity her, and this feeling\r\nsucceeded in banishing all bitterness from my heart.\r\n\r\nI did my utmost to give her confidence and to make her believe that our\r\npresent misfortunes were but momentary. This was no easy task, as she\r\nwould constantly compare the diminutive aspect of the town of Zürich\r\nwith the more noble majesty of Dresden, and seemed to feel bitterly\r\nhumiliated. The friends whom I introduced to her found no favour in her\r\neyes. She looked upon the Cantonal Secretary, Sulzer, as a ‘mere town\r\nclerk who would not be of any importance in. Germany’; and the wife of\r\nmy host Muller absolutely disgusted her when, in answer to Minna’s\r\ncomplaints about my terrible position, she replied that my greatness\r\nlay in the very fact of my having faced it. Then again Minna appeased\r\nme by tolling me of the expected arrival of some of my Dresden\r\nbelongings, which she thought would be indispensable to our new home.\r\n\r\nThe property of which she spoke consisted of a Breitkopf and Hartel\r\ngrand-piano that looked better than it sounded, and of the ‘title-page’\r\nof the Nibelungen by Cornelius in a Gothic frame that used to hang over\r\nmy desk in Dresden.\r\n\r\nWith this nucleus of household effects we now decided to take small\r\nlodgings in the so-called ‘hinteren Escherhausern’ in the Zeltweg. With\r\ngreat cleverness Minna had succeeded in selling the Dresden furniture\r\nto advantage, and out of the proceeds of this sale she had brought\r\nthree hundred marks with her to Zürich to help towards setting up our\r\nnew home. She told me that she had saved my small but very select\r\nlibrary for me by giving it into the safe custody of the publisher,\r\nHeinrich Brockhaus (brother of my sister’s husband and member of the\r\nSaxon Diet), who had insisted upon looking after it. Great, therefore,\r\nwas her dismay when, upon asking this kind friend to send her the\r\nbooks, he replied that he was holding them as security for a debt of\r\nfifteen hundred marks which I had contracted with him during my days of\r\ntrouble in Dresden, and that he intended to keep them until that sum\r\nwas returned. As even after the lapse of many years I found it\r\nimpossible to refund this money, these books, collected for my own\r\nspecial wants, were lost to me for ever.\r\n\r\nThanks more particularly to my friend Sulzer, the Cantonal Secretary,\r\nwhom my wife at first despised so much on account of his title which\r\nshe misunderstood, and who, although he was far from well-off himself,\r\nthought it only natural that he should help me, however moderately, out\r\nof my difficulties, we soon succeeded in making our little place look\r\nso cosy that my simple Zürich friends felt quite at home in it. My\r\nwife, with all her undeniable talents, hero found ample scope in which\r\nto distinguish herself, and I remember how ingeniously she made a\r\nlittle what-not out of the box in which she had kindly brought my music\r\nand manuscript to Zürich.\r\n\r\nBut it was soon time to think of how to earn enough money to provide\r\nfor us all. My idea of giving public lectures was treated with contempt\r\nby my wife, who looked upon it as an insult to her pride. She could\r\nacquiesce only in one plan, that suggested by Liszt, namely, that I\r\nshould write an opera for Paris. To satisfy her, and in view of the\r\nfact that I could see no chance of a remunerative occupation close at\r\nhand, I actually reopened a correspondence on this matter with my great\r\nfriend and his secretary Belloni in Paris. In the meantime I could not\r\nbe idle, so I accepted an invitation from the Zürich musical society to\r\nconduct a classical composition at one of their concerts, and to this\r\nend I worked with their very poor orchestra at Beethoven’s Symphony in\r\nA major. Although the result was successful, and I received five\r\nnapoleons for my trouble, it made my wife very unhappy, for she could\r\nnot forget the excellent orchestra, and the much more appreciative\r\npublic, which a short time before in Dresden would have seconded and\r\nrewarded similar efforts on my part. Her one and only ideal for me was\r\nthat, by hook or by crook, and with a total disregard of all artistic\r\nscruples, I should make a brilliant reputation for myself in Paris.\r\nWhile we were both absolutely at a loss to discover whence we should\r\nobtain the necessary funds for our journey to Paris and our sojourn\r\nthere, I again plunged into my philosophical study of art, as being the\r\nonly sphere still left open to me.\r\n\r\nHarrassed by the cares of a terrible struggle for existence, I wrote\r\nthe whole of Das Kunstwerk der Zukunft in the chilly atmosphere of a\r\nsunless little room on the ground floor during the months of November\r\nand December of that year. Minna had no objection to this occupation\r\nwhen I told her of the success of my first pamphlet, and the hope I had\r\nof receiving even better pay for this more extensive work.\r\n\r\nThus for a while I enjoyed comparative peace, although in my heart a\r\nspirit of unrest had begun to reign, thanks to my growing acquaintance\r\nwith Feuerbach’s works. I had always had an inclination to fathom the\r\ndepths of philosophy, just as I had been led by the mystic influence of\r\nBeethoven’s Ninth Symphony to search the deepest recesses of music. My\r\nfirst efforts at satisfying this longing had failed. None of the\r\nLeipzig professors had succeeded in fascinating me with their lectures\r\non fundamental philosophy and logic. I had procured Schelling’s work,\r\nTranscendental Idealism, recommended to me by Gustav Schlesinger, a\r\nfriend of Laube’s, but it was in vain that I racked my brains to try\r\nand make something out of the first pages, and I always returned to my\r\nNinth Symphony.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of my stay in Dresden I had returned to these\r\nold studies, the longing for which suddenly revived within me, and to\r\nthese I added the deeper historical studies which had always fascinated\r\nme. As an introduction to philosophy I now chose Hegel’s Philosophy of\r\nHistory. A good deal of this impressed me deeply, and it now seemed as\r\nif I should ultimately penetrate into the Holy of Holies along this\r\npath. The more incomprehensible many of his speculative conclusions\r\nappeared, the more I felt myself desirous of probing the question of\r\nthe ‘Absolute’ and everything connected therewith to the core. For I so\r\nadmired Hegel’s powerful mind that it seemed to me he was the very\r\nkeystone of all philosophical thought.\r\n\r\nThe revolution intervened; the practical tendencies of a social\r\nreconstruction distracted my attention, and as I have already stated,\r\nit was a German Catholic priest and political agitator (formerly a\r\ndivinity student named Menzdorff, who used to wear a Calabrian hat)[18]\r\nwho drew my attention to ‘the only real philosopher of modern times,’\r\nLudwig Feuerbach. My new Zürich friend, the piano teacher, Wilhelm\r\nBaumgartner, made me a present of Feuerbach’s book on Tod und\r\nUnsterblichkeit (‘Death and Immortality’). The well-known and stirring\r\nlyrical style of the author greatly fascinated me as a layman. The\r\nintricate questions which he propounds in this book as if they were\r\nbeing discussed for the first time by him, and which he treats in a\r\ncharmingly exhaustive manner, had often occupied my mind since the very\r\nfirst days of my acquaintance with Lehrs in Paris, just as they occupy\r\nthe mind of every imaginative and serious man. With me, however, this\r\nwas not lasting, and I had contented myself with the poetic suggestions\r\non these important subjects which appear here and there in the works of\r\nour great poets.\r\n\r\n [18] A broad-rimmed, tall, white felt hat, tapering to a point,\r\n originally worn by the inhabitants of Calabria, and in 1848 a sign of\r\n Republicanism.—EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frankness with which Feuerbach explains his views on these\r\ninteresting questions, in the more mature parts of his book, pleased me\r\nas much by their tragic as by their social-radical tendencies. It\r\nseemed right that the only true immortality should be that of sublime\r\ndeeds and great works of art. It was more difficult to sustain any\r\ninterest in Das Wesen des Christenthums (‘The Essence of Christianity’)\r\nby the same author, for it was impossible whilst reading this work not\r\nto become conscious, however involuntarily, of the prolix and unskilful\r\nmanner in which he dilates on the simple and fundamental idea, namely,\r\nreligion explained from a purely subjective and psychological point of\r\nview. Nevertheless, from that day onward I always regarded Feuerbach as\r\nthe ideal exponent of the radical release of the individual from the\r\nthraldom of accepted notions, founded on the belief in authority. The\r\ninitiated will therefore not wonder that I dedicated my Kunstwerk der\r\nZukunft to Feuerbach and addressed its preface to him.\r\n\r\nMy friend Sulzer, a thorough disciple of Hegel, was very sorry to see\r\nme so interested in Feuerbach, whom he did not even recognise as a\r\nphilosopher at all. He said that the best thing that Feuerbach had done\r\nfor me was that he had been the means of awakening my ideas, although\r\nhe himself had none. But what had really induced me to attach so much\r\nimportance to Feuerbach was the conclusion by means of which he had\r\nseceded from his master Hegel, to wit, that the best philosophy was to\r\nhave no philosophy—a theory which greatly simplified what I had\r\nformerly considered a very terrifying study—and secondly, that only\r\nthat was real which could be ascertained by the senses.\r\n\r\nThe fact that he proclaimed what we call ‘spirit’ to be an aesthetic\r\nperception of our senses, together with his statement concerning the\r\nfutility of philosophy—these were the two things in him which rendered\r\nme such useful assistance in my conceptions of an all-embracing work of\r\nart, of a perfect drama which should appeal to the simplest and most\r\npurely human emotions at the very moment when it approached its\r\nfulfilment as Kunstwerk der Zukunft. It must have been this which\r\nSulzer had in his mind when he spoke deprecatingly of Feuerbach’s\r\ninfluence over me. At all events, after a while I certainly could not\r\nreturn to his works, and I remember that his newly published book, Uber\r\ndas Wesen der Religion (‘Lectures on the Essence of Religion’), scared\r\nme to such an extent by the dullness of its title alone, that when\r\nHerwegh opened it for my benefit, I closed it with a bang under his\r\nvery nose.\r\n\r\nAt that time I was working with great enthusiasm upon the draft of a\r\nconnected essay, and was delighted one day to receive a visit from the\r\nnovelist and Tieckian scholar, Eduard von Billow (the father of my\r\nyoung friend Billow), who was passing through Zürich. In my tiny little\r\nroom I read him my chapter on poetry, and could not help noticing that\r\nhe was greatly startled at my ideas on literary drama and on the advent\r\nof the new Shakespeare. I thought this all the more reason why Wigand\r\nthe publisher should accept my new revolutionary book, and expected him\r\nto pay me a fee which would be in proportion to the greater size of the\r\nwork. I asked for twenty louis d’or, and this sum he agreed to pay me.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of receiving this amount induced me to carry out the plan,\r\nwhich need had forced upon me, of travelling to Paris and of trying my\r\nluck there as a composer of opera. This plan had very serious\r\ndrawbacks; not only did I hate the idea, but I knew that I was doing an\r\ninjustice to myself by believing in the success of my enterprise, for I\r\nfelt that I could never seriously throw myself into it heart and soul.\r\nEverything, however, combined to make me try the experiment, and it was\r\nLiszt in particular who, confident of this being my only way to fame,\r\ninsisted upon my reopening the negotiations into which Belloni and I\r\nhad entered during the previous summer. To show with what earnestness I\r\ntried to consider the chances of carrying out my plan, I drafted out\r\nthe plot of the opera, which the French poet would only have to put\r\ninto verse, because I never for a moment fancied that it would be\r\npossible for him to think out and write a libretto for which I would\r\nonly need to compose the music. I chose for my subject the legend of\r\nWieland der Schmied, upon which I commented with some stress at the end\r\nof my recently finished Kunstwerk der Zukunft, and the version of which\r\nby Simrock, taken from the Wilkyna legend, had greatly attracted me.\r\n\r\nI sketched out the complete scenario with precise indication of the\r\ndialogue for three acts, and with a heavy heart decided to hand it over\r\nto my Parisian author to be worked out. Liszt thought he saw a means of\r\nmaking my music known through his relations with Seghers, the musical\r\ndirector of a society then known as the ‘Concerts de St. Cecile.’ In\r\nJanuary of the following year the Tannhäuser Overture was to be given\r\nunder his baton, and it therefore seemed advisable that I should reach\r\nParis some time before this event. This undertaking, which appeared to\r\nbe so difficult owing to my complete lack of funds, was at last\r\nfacilitated in a manner quite unexpected.\r\n\r\nI had written home for help, and had appealed to all the old friends I\r\ncould think of, but in vain. By the family of my brother Albert in\r\nparticular, whose daughter had recently entered upon a brilliant\r\ntheatrical career, I was treated in much the same way as one treats an\r\ninvalid by whom one dreads to become infected. In contrast to their\r\nharshness I was deeply touched by the devotion of the Ritter family,\r\nwho had remained in Dresden; for, apart from my acquaintance with young\r\nKarl, I scarcely knew these people at all. Through the kindness of my\r\nold friend Heine, who had been informed of my position, Frau Julie\r\nRitter, the venerable mother of the family, had thought it her duty to\r\nplace, through a business friend, the sum of fifteen hundred marks at\r\nmy disposal. At about the same time I received a letter from Mme.\r\nLaussot, who had called upon me in Dresden the year before, and who now\r\nin the most affecting terms assured me of her continued sympathy.\r\n\r\nThese were the first signs of that new phase in my life upon which I\r\nentered from this day forth, and in which I accustomed myself to look\r\nupon the outward circumstances of my existence as being merely\r\nsubservient to my will. And by this means I was able to escape from the\r\nhampering narrowness of my home life.\r\n\r\nFor the moment the proffered financial assistance was very distasteful\r\nto me, for it seemed to forbid my raising any further objections to the\r\nrealisation of the detested Paris schemes. When, however, on the\r\nstrength of this favourable change in my affairs, I suggested to my\r\nwife that we might, after all, content ourselves with remaining in\r\nZürich, she flew into the most violent passion over my weakness and\r\nlack of spirit, and declared that if I did not make up my mind to\r\nachieve something in Paris, she would lose all faith in me. She said,\r\nmoreover, that she absolutely refused to be a witness of my misery and\r\ngrief as a wretched literary man and insignificant conductor of local\r\nconcerts in Zürich.\r\n\r\nWe had entered upon the year 1850; I had decided to go to Paris, if\r\nonly for the sake of peace, but had to postpone my journey on account\r\nof ill-health. The reaction following upon the terrible excitement of\r\nrecent times had not failed to have its effect on my overwrought\r\nnerves, and a state of complete exhaustion had followed. The continual\r\ncolds, in spite of which I had been obliged to work in my very\r\nunhealthy room, had at last given rise to alarming symptoms. A certain\r\nweakness of the chest became apparent, and this the doctor (a political\r\nrefugee) undertook to cure by the application of pitch plasters. As the\r\nresult of this treatment and the irritating effect it had upon my\r\nnerves, I lost my voice completely for a while; whereupon I was told\r\nthat I must go away for a change. On going out to buy my ticket for the\r\njourney, I felt so weak and broke out into such terrible perspiration\r\nthat I hastened to return to my wife in order to consult her as to the\r\nadvisability, in the circumstances, of abandoning the idea of the\r\nexpedition altogether. She, however, maintained (and perhaps rightly)\r\nnot only that my condition was not dangerous, but that it was to a\r\nlarge extent due to imagination, and that, once in the right place, I\r\nwould soon recover.\r\n\r\nAn inexpressible feeling of bitterness stimulated my nerves as in anger\r\nand despair I quickly left the house to buy the confounded ticket for\r\nthe journey, and in the beginning of February I actually started on the\r\nroad to Paris. I was filled with the most extraordinary feelings, but\r\nthe spark of hope which was then kindled in my breast certainly had\r\nnothing whatever to do with the belief that had been imposed upon me\r\nfrom without, that I was to make a success in Paris as a composer of\r\noperas.\r\n\r\nI was particularly anxious to find quiet rooms, for peace had now\r\nbecome my first necessity, no matter where I happened to be staying.\r\nThe cabman who drove me from street to street through the most isolated\r\nquarters, and whom I at last accused of keeping always to the most\r\nanimated parts of the city, finally protested in despair that one did\r\nnot come to Paris to live in a convent. At last it occurred to me to\r\nlook for what I wanted in one of the cites through which no vehicle\r\nseemed to drive, and I decided to engage rooms in the Cite de Provence.\r\n\r\nTrue to the plans which had been forced upon me, I at once called on\r\nHerr Seghers about the performance of the Tannhäuser Overture.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that in spite of my late arrival I had missed nothing,\r\nfor they were still racking their brains as to how to procure the\r\nnecessary orchestral parts.\r\n\r\nI therefore had to write to Liszt, asking him to order the copies, and\r\nhad to wait for their arrival. Belloni was not in town, things were\r\ntherefore at a standstill, and I had plenty of time to think over the\r\nobject of my visit to Paris, while an unceasing accompaniment was\r\npoured out to my meditations by the barrel-organs which infest the\r\ncites of Paris.\r\n\r\nI had much difficulty in convincing an agent of the government, from\r\nwhom I received a visit soon after my arrival, that my presence in\r\nParis was due to artistic reasons, and not to my doubtful position as a\r\npolitical refugee.\r\n\r\nFortunately he was impressed by the score, which I showed him, as well\r\nas by Liszt’s article on the Tannhäuser Overture, written the year\r\nbefore in the Journal des Debats, and he left me, politely inviting me\r\nto continue my avocations peacefully and industriously, as the police\r\nhad no intention of disturbing me.\r\n\r\nI also looked up my older Parisian acquaintances. At the hospitable\r\nhouse of Desplechins I met Semper, who was trying to make his position\r\nas tolerable as possible by writing some inferior artistic work. He had\r\nleft his family in Dresden, from which town we soon received the most\r\nalarming news. The prisons were gradually filling there with the\r\nunfortunate victims of the recent Saxon movement Of Röckel, Bakunin,\r\nand Heubner, all we could hear was that they had been charged with high\r\ntreason, and that they were awaiting the death sentence.\r\n\r\nIn view of the tidings which continually arrived concerning the cruelty\r\nand brutality with which the soldiers treated the prisoners, we could\r\nnot help considering our own lot a very happy one.\r\n\r\nMy intercourse with Semper, whom I saw frequently, was generally\r\nenlivened by a gaiety which was occasionally of rather a risky nature;\r\nhe was determined to rejoin his family in London, where the prospect of\r\nvarious appointments was open to him. My latest attempts at writing,\r\nand the thoughts expressed in my work, interested him greatly, and gave\r\nrise to animated conversations in which we were joined by Kietz, who\r\nwas at first amusing, but evidently boring Semper considerably. I found\r\nthe former in the identical position in which I had left him many years\r\nago: he had made no headway with his painting, and would have been glad\r\nif the revolution had taken a more decided turn, so that, under cover\r\nof the general confusion, he might have escaped from his embarrassing\r\nposition with his landlord. He made at this time quite a good pastel\r\nportrait of me in his very best and earliest style. While I was sitting\r\nI unfortunately spoke to him about my Das Kunstwerk der Zukunft, and\r\nthereby laid the foundation for him of troubles that lasted many years,\r\nas he tried to instil my new ideas into the Parisian bourgeoisie at\r\nwhose tables he had hitherto been a welcome guest. Notwithstanding, he\r\nremained as of old a good, obliging, true-hearted fellow, and even\r\nSemper could not help putting up with him cheerfully. I also looked up\r\nmy friend Anders. It was a difficult matter to find him at any hour of\r\nthe day, since out of sleeping hours he was closeted in the library,\r\nwhere he could receive no one, and afterwards retired to the\r\nreading-room to spend his hours of rest, and generally went to dine\r\nwith certain bourgeois families where he gave music lessons. He had\r\naged considerably, but I was glad to find him, comparatively speaking,\r\nin better health than the state in which I had last seen him had\r\nallowed me to hope, as when I left Paris before he had seemed to be in\r\na decline. Curiously enough, a broken leg had been the means of\r\nimproving his health, the treatment necessary for it having taken him\r\nto a hydro, where his condition had much improved. His one idea was to\r\nsee me achieve a great success in Paris, and he wished to secure a seat\r\nin advance for the first performance of my opera, which he took for\r\ngranted was to appear, and kept repeating that it would be so very\r\ntrying for him to occupy a place in any part of the theatre where there\r\nwould be likely to be a crush. He could not see the use of my present\r\nliterary work; in spite of this I was again engaged on it exclusively,\r\nas I soon ascertained there was no likelihood of my overture to\r\nTannhäuser being produced. Liszt had shown the greatest zeal in\r\nobtaining and forwarding the orchestral parts; but Herr Seghers\r\ninformed me that as far as his own orchestra was concerned, he found\r\nhimself in a republican democracy where each instrument had an equal\r\nright to voice its opinion, and it had been unanimously decided that\r\nfor the remainder of the winter season, which was now drawing to a\r\nclose, my overture could be dispensed with. I gathered enough from this\r\nturn of affairs to realise how precarious my position was.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the result of my writings was hardly less discouraging. A\r\ncopy of the Wigand edition of my Kunstwerk der Zukunft was forwarded to\r\nme full of horrible misprints, and instead of the expected remuneration\r\nof twenty louis d’or, my publisher explained that for the present he\r\ncould only pay me half this sum, as, owing to the fact that at first\r\nthe sale of the Kunst und Revolution had been very rapid, he had been\r\nled to attach too high a commercial value to my writings, a mistake he\r\nhad speedily discovered when he found there was no demand for Die\r\nNibelungen.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I received an offer of remunerative work from Adolph\r\nKolatschek, who was also a fugitive, and was just going to bring out a\r\nGerman monthly journal as the organ of the progressive party. In\r\nresponse to this invitation I wrote a long essay on Kunst und Klima\r\n(‘Art and Climate’), in which I supplemented the ideas I had already\r\ntouched upon in my Kunstwerk der Zukunft. Besides this I had, since my\r\narrival in Paris, worked out a more complete sketch of Wieland der\r\nSchmied. It is true that this work had no longer any value, and I\r\nwondered with apprehension what I could write home to my wife, now that\r\nthe last precious remittance had been so aimlessly sacrificed. The\r\nthought of returning to Zürich was as distasteful to me as the prospect\r\nof remaining any longer in Paris. My feelings with regard to the latter\r\nalternative were intensified by the impression made upon me by\r\nMeyerbeer’s opera The Prophet, which had just been produced and which I\r\nhad not heard before. Rearing itself on the ruins of the hopes for new\r\nand more noble endeavour which had animated the better works of the\r\npast year—the only result of the negotiations of the provisional French\r\nrepublic for the encouragement of art—I saw this work of Meyerbeer’s\r\nbreak upon the world like the dawn heralding this day of disgraceful\r\ndesolation. I was so sickened by this performance, that though I was\r\nunfortunately placed in the centre of the stalls and would willingly\r\nhave avoided the disturbance necessarily occasioned by one of the\r\naudience moving during the middle of an act, even this consideration\r\ndid not deter me from getting up and leaving the house. When the famous\r\nmother of the prophet finally gives vent to her grief in the well-known\r\nseries of ridiculous roulades, I was filled with rage and despair at\r\nthe thought that I should be called upon to listen to such a thing, and\r\nnever again did I pay the slightest heed to this opera.\r\n\r\nBut what was I to do next? Just as the South American republics had\r\nattracted me during my first miserable sojourn in Paris, so now my\r\nlonging was directed towards the East, where I could live my life in a\r\nmanner worthy of a human being far away from this modern world. While I\r\nwas in this frame of mind I was called upon to answer another inquiry\r\nas to my state of health from Mme. Laussot in Bordeaux. It turned out\r\nthat my answer prompted her to send me a kind and pressing invitation\r\nto go and stay at her house, at least for a short time, to rest and\r\nforget my troubles. In any circumstances an excursion to more southerly\r\nregions, which I had not yet seen, and a visit to people who, though\r\nutter strangers, showed such friendly interest in me, could not fail to\r\nprove attractive and flattering. I accepted, settled my affairs in\r\nParis, and went by coach via Orleans, Tours, and Angouleme, down the\r\nGironde to the unknown town, where I was received with great courtesy\r\nand cordiality by the young wine merchant Eugene Laussot, and presented\r\nto my sympathetic young friend, his wife. A closer acquaintance with\r\nthe family, in which Mrs. Taylor, Mme. Laussot’s mother, was now also\r\nincluded, led to a clearer understanding of the character of the\r\nsympathy bestowed upon me in such a cordial and unexpected manner by\r\npeople hitherto unknown to me. Jessie, as the young wife was called at\r\nhome, had, during a somewhat lengthy stay in Dresden, become very\r\nintimate with the Ritter family, and I had no reason to doubt the\r\nassurance given me, that the Laussots’ interest in me and my work was\r\nprincipally owing to this intimacy. After my flight from Dresden, as\r\nsoon as the news of my difficulties had reached the Ritters, a\r\ncorrespondence had been carried on between Dresden and Bordeaux with a\r\nview to ascertaining how best to assist me. Jessie attributed the whole\r\nidea to Frau Julie Ritter who, while not being well enough off herself\r\nto make me a sufficient allowance, was endeavouring to come to an\r\nunderstanding with Jessie’s mother, the well-to-do widow of an English\r\nlawyer, whose income entirely supported the young couple in Bordeaux.\r\nThis plan had so far succeeded, that shortly after my arrival in\r\nBordeaux Mrs. Taylor informed me that the two families had combined,\r\nand that it had been decided to ask me to accept the help of three\r\nthousand francs a year until the return of better days. My one object\r\nnow was to enlighten my benefactors as to the exact conditions under\r\nwhich I should be accepting such assistance. I could no longer reckon\r\nupon achieving any success as a composer of opera either in Paris or\r\nelsewhere; what line I should take up instead I did not know; but, at\r\nall events, I was determined to keep myself free from the disgrace\r\nwhich would reflect upon my whole life if I used such means as this\r\noffer presented to secure success. I feel sure I am not wrong in\r\nbelieving that Jessie was the only one who understood me, and though I\r\nonly experienced kindness from the rest of the family, I soon\r\ndiscovered the gulf by which she, as well as myself, was separated from\r\nher mother and husband. While the husband, who was a handsome young\r\nman, was away the greater part of the day attending to his business,\r\nand the mother’s deafness excluded her to a great extent from our\r\nconversations, we soon discovered by a rapid exchange of ideas that we\r\nshared the same opinions on many important matters, and this led to a\r\ngreat feeling of friendship between us. Jessie, who was at that time\r\nabout twenty-two, bore little resemblance to her mother, and no doubt\r\ntook after her father, of whom I heard most flattering accounts. A\r\nlarge and varied collection of books loft by this man to his daughter\r\nshowed his tastes, for besides carrying on his lucrative profession as\r\na lawyer, he had devoted himself to the study of literature and\r\nscience. From him Jessie had also learned German as a child, and she\r\nspoke that language with great fluency. She had been brought up on\r\nGrimm’s fairy-tales, and was, moreover, thoroughly acquainted with\r\nGerman poetry, as well as with that of England and France, and her\r\nknowledge of them was as thorough as the most advanced education could\r\ndemand. French literature did not appeal to her much. Her quick powers\r\nof comprehension were astonishing. Everything which I touched upon she\r\nimmediately grasped and assimilated. It was the same with music: she\r\nread at sight with the greatest facility, and was an accomplished\r\nplayer. During her stay in Dresden she had been told that I was still\r\nin search of the pianist who could play Beethoven’s great Sonata in B\r\nflat major, and she now astonished me by her finished rendering of this\r\nmost difficult piece. The emotion aroused in me by finding such an\r\nexceptionally developed talent suddenly changed to anxiety when I heard\r\nher sing. Her sharp, shrill voice, in which there was strength but no\r\nreal depth of feeling, so shocked me that I could not refrain from\r\nbegging her to desist from singing in future. With regard to the\r\nexecution of the sonata, she listened eagerly to my instructions as to\r\nhow it should be interpreted, though I could not feel that she would\r\nsucceed in rendering it according to my ideas. I read her my latest\r\nessays, and she seemed to understand even the most extraordinary\r\ndescriptions perfectly. My poem on Siegfried’s Tod moved her deeply,\r\nbut she preferred my sketch of Wieland der Schmied. She admitted\r\nafterwards that she would prefer to imagine herself filling the role of\r\nWieland’s worthy bride than to find herself in the position and forced\r\nto endure the fate of Gutrune in Siegfried. It followed inevitably that\r\nthe presence of the other members of the family proved embarrassing\r\nwhen we wanted to talk over and discuss these various subjects. If we\r\nfelt somewhat troubled at having to confess to ourselves that Mrs.\r\nTaylor would certainly never be able to understand why I was being\r\noffered assistance, I was still more disconcerted at realising after a\r\ntime the complete want of harmony between the young couple,\r\nparticularly from an intellectual point of view. The fact that Laussot\r\nhad for some time been well aware of his wife’s dislike for him was\r\nplainly shown when he one day so far forgot himself as to complain\r\nloudly and bitterly that she would not even love a child of his if she\r\nhad one, and that he therefore thought it fortunate that she was not a\r\nmother. Astonished and saddened, I suddenly gazed into an abyss which\r\nwas hidden here, as is often the case, under the appearance of a\r\ntolerably happy married life. About this time, and just as my visit,\r\nwhich had already lasted three weeks, was drawing to a close, I\r\nreceived a letter from my wife that could not have had a more\r\nunfortunate effect on my state of mind. She was, on the whole, pleased\r\nat my having found new friends, but at the same time explained that if\r\nI did not immediately return to Paris, and there endeavour to secure\r\nthe production of my overture with the results anticipated, she would\r\nnot know what to think of me, and would certainly fail to understand me\r\nif I returned to Zürich without having effected my purpose. At the same\r\ntime my depression was intensified in a terrible way by a notice in the\r\npapers announcing that Röckel, Bakunin, and Heubner had been sentenced\r\nto death, and that the date of their execution was fixed. I wrote a\r\nshort but stirring letter of farewell to the two first, and as I saw no\r\npossibility of having it conveyed to the prisoners, who were confined\r\nin the fortress of Konigstein, I decided to send it to Frau von\r\nLüttichau, to be forwarded to them by her, because I thought she was\r\nthe only person in whose power it might lie to do this for me, while at\r\nthe same time she had sufficient generosity and independence of mind to\r\nenable her to respect and carry out my wishes, in spite of any possible\r\ndifference of opinion she might entertain. I was told some time\r\nafterwards that Lüttichau had got hold of the letter and thrown it into\r\nthe fire. For the time being this painful impression helped me to the\r\ndetermination to break with every one and everything, to lose all\r\ndesire to learn more of life or of art, and, even at the risk of having\r\nto endure the greatest privations, to trust to chance and put myself\r\nbeyond the reach of everybody. The small income settled upon me by my\r\nfriends I wished to divide between myself and my wife, and with my half\r\ngo to Greece or Asia Minor, and there, Heaven alone knew how, seek to\r\nforget and be forgotten. I communicated this plan to the only\r\nconfidante I had left to me, chiefly in order that she might be able to\r\nenlighten my benefactors as to how I intended disposing of the income\r\nthey had offered me. She seemed pleased with the idea, and the resolve\r\nto abandon herself to the same fate seemed to her also, in her\r\nresentment against her position, to be quite an easy matter. She\r\nexpressed us much by hints and a word dropped here and there. Without\r\nclearly realising what it would lead to, and without coming to any\r\nunderstanding with her, I left Bordeaux towards the end of April, more\r\nexcited than soothed in spirit, and filled with regret and anxiety. I\r\nreturned to Paris, for the time being, stunned and full of uncertainty\r\nas to what to do next. Feeling very unwell, exhausted, and at the same\r\ntime excited from want of sleep, I reached my destination and put up at\r\nthe Hotel Valois, where I remained a week, struggling to gain my\r\nself-control and to face my strange position. Even if I had wished to\r\nresume the plans which had been instrumental in bringing me to Paris, I\r\nsoon convinced myself that little or nothing could be done. I was\r\nfilled with distress and anger at being called upon to waste my\r\nenergies in a direction contrary to my tastes, merely to satisfy the\r\nunreasonable demands made upon me. I was at length obliged to answer my\r\nwife’s last pressing communication, and wrote her a long and detailed\r\nletter in which I kindly, but at the same time frankly, retraced the\r\nwhole of our life together, and explained that I was fully determined\r\nto set her free from any immediate participation in my fate, as I felt\r\nquite incapable of so arranging it so as to meet with her approval. I\r\npromised her the half of whatever means I should have at my disposal\r\nnow or in the future, and told her she must accept this arrangement\r\nwith a good grace, because the occasion had now arisen to take that\r\nstep of parting from me which, on our first meeting again in\r\nSwitzerland, she had declared herself ready to do. I ended my letter\r\nwithout bidding her a final farewell. I thereupon wrote to Bordeaux\r\nimmediately to inform Jessie of the step I had taken, though my means\r\ndid not as yet allow of my forming any definite plan which I could\r\ncommunicate to her for my complete flight from the world. In return she\r\nannounced that she was determined to do likewise, and asked for my\r\nprotection, under which she intended to place herself when once she had\r\nset herself free. Much alarmed, I did all in my power to make her\r\nrealise that it was one thing for a man, placed in such a desperate\r\nsituation as myself, to cut himself adrift in the face of\r\ninsurmountable difficulties, but quite another matter for a young\r\nwoman, at least to all outward appearances, happily settled, to decide\r\nto break up her home, for reasons which probably no one except myself\r\nwould be in a position to understand. Regarding the unconventionality\r\nof her resolve in the eyes of the world, she assured me that it would\r\nbe carried out as quietly as possible, and that for the present she\r\nmerely thought of arranging to visit her friends the Ritters in\r\nDresden. I felt so upset by all this that I yielded to my craving for\r\nretirement, and sought it at no great distance from Paris. Towards the\r\nmiddle of April I went to Montmorency, of which I had heard many\r\nagreeable accounts, and there sought a modest hiding-place. With great\r\ndifficulty I dragged myself to the outskirts of the little town, where\r\nthe country still bore a wintry aspect, and turned into the little\r\nstrip of garden belonging to a wine merchant, which was filled with\r\nvisitors only on Sundays, and there refreshed myself with some bread\r\nand cheese and a bottle of wine. A crowd of hens surrounded me, and I\r\nkept throwing them pieces of bread, and was touched by the\r\nself-sacrificing abstemiousness with which the cock gave all to his\r\nwives though I aimed particularly at him. They became bolder and\r\nbolder, and finally flew on to the table and attacked my provisions;\r\nthe cock flew after them, and noticing that everything was topsy-turvy,\r\npounced upon the cheese with the eagerness of a craving long\r\nunsatisfied. When I found myself being driven from the table by this\r\nchaos of fluttering wings, I was filled with a gaiety to which I had\r\nlong been a stranger. I laughed heartily, and looked round for the\r\nsignboard of the inn. I thereby discovered that my host rejoiced in the\r\nname of Homo. This seemed a hint from Fate, and I felt I must seek\r\nshelter here at all costs. An extraordinarily small and narrow bedroom\r\nwas shown me, which I immediately engaged. Besides the bed it held a\r\nrough table and two cane-bottomed chairs. I arranged one of these as a\r\nwashhand-stand, and on the table I placed some books, writing\r\nmaterials, and the score of Lohengrin, and almost heaved a sigh of\r\ncontent in spite of my extremely cramped accommodation. Though the\r\nweather remained uncertain and the woods with their leafless trees did\r\nnot seem to offer the prospect of very enticing walks, I still felt\r\nthat here there was a possibility of my being forgotten, and being also\r\nin my turn allowed to forget the events that had lately filled me with\r\nMidi desperate anxiety. My old artistic instinct awoke again. I looked\r\nover my Lohengrin score, and quickly decided to send it to Liszt and\r\nleave it to him to bring it out as best he could. Now that I had got\r\nrid of this score also, I felt as free as a bird and as careless as\r\nDiogenes about what might befall me. I even invited Kietz to come and\r\nstay with me and share the pleasures of my retreat. He did actually\r\ncome, as he had done during my stay in. Mendon; but he found me even\r\nmore modestly installed than I had been there. He was quite prepared to\r\ntake pot-luck, however, and cheerfully slept on an improvised bed,\r\npromising to keep the world in touch with me upon his return to Paris.\r\nI was suddenly startled from my state of complacency by the news that\r\nmy wife had come to Paris to look me up. I had an hour’s painful\r\nstruggle with myself to settle the course I should pursue, and decided\r\nnot to allow the step I had taken in regard to her to be looked upon as\r\nan ill-considered and excusable vagary. I left Montmorency and betook\r\nmyself to Paris, summoned Kietz to my hotel, and instructed him to tell\r\nmy wife, who had already been trying to gain admittance to him, that he\r\nknew nothing more of me except that I had left Paris. The poor fellow,\r\nwho felt as much pity for Minna as for me, was so utterly bewildered on\r\nthis occasion, that he declared that he felt as though he were the axis\r\nupon which all the misery in the world turned. But he apparently\r\nrealised the significance and importance of my decision, as it was\r\nnecessary he should, and acquitted himself in this delicate matter with\r\nintelligence and good feeling. That night t left Paris by train for\r\nClermont-Tonnerre, from whence I travelled on to Geneva, there to await\r\nnews from Frau Ritter in Dresden. My exhaustion was such that, even had\r\nI possessed the necessary means, I could not as yet have contemplated\r\nundergoing the fatigue of a long journey. By way of gaining time for\r\nfurther developments I retired to Villeneuve, at the other end of the\r\nLake of Geneva, where I put up at the Hotel Byron, which was quite\r\nempty at the time. Here I learned that Karl Ritter had arrived in\r\nZürich, as he said he would, with the intention of paying me a visit.\r\nImpressing upon him the necessity for the strictest secrecy, I invited\r\nhim to join me at the Lake of Geneva, and in the second week in May we\r\nmet at the Hotel Byron. The characteristic which pleased me in him was\r\nhis absolute devotion, his quick comprehension of my position and the\r\nnecessity of my resolutions, as well as his readiness to submit without\r\nquestion to all my arrangements, even where he himself was concerned.\r\nHe was full of my latest literary efforts, told me what an impression\r\nthey had made on his acquaintances, and thereby induced me to spend the\r\nfew days of rest I was enjoying in preparing my poem of Siegfried’s Tod\r\nfor publication.\r\n\r\nI wrote a short preface dedicating this poem to my friends as a relic\r\nof the time when I had hoped to devote myself entirely to art, and\r\nespecially to the composition of music. I sent this manuscript to Herr\r\nWigand in Leipzig, who returned it to me after some time with the\r\nremark, that if I insisted on its being printed in Latin characters he\r\nwould not be able to sell a single copy of it. Later on I discovered\r\nthat he deliberately refused to pay me the ten louis d’or due to me for\r\nDas Kunstwerk der Zukunft, which I had directed him to send to my wife.\r\nDisappointing as all this was, I was nevertheless unable to engage in\r\nany further work, as only a few days after Karl’s arrival the realities\r\nof life made themselves felt in an unexpected manner, most upsetting to\r\nmy tranquillity of mind. I received a wildly excited letter from Mme.\r\nLaussot to tell me that she had not been able to resist telling her\r\nmother of her intentions, that in so doing she had immediately aroused\r\nthe suspicion that I was to blame, and in consequence of this her\r\ndisclosure had been communicated to M. Laussot, who vowed he would\r\nsearch everywhere for me in order to put a bullet through my body. The\r\nsituation was clear enough, and I decided to go to Bordeaux immediately\r\nin order to come to an understanding with my opponent I at once wrote\r\nfully to M. Eugene, endeavouring to make him see matters in their true\r\nlight, but at the same time declared myself incapable of understanding\r\nhow a man could bring himself to keep a woman with him by force, when\r\nshe no longer wished to remain. I ended by informing him that I should\r\nreach Bordeaux at, the same time as my letter, and immediately upon my\r\narrival there would let him know at what hotel to find me; also that I\r\nwould not tell his wife of the step I was taking, and that he could\r\nconsequently act without restraint. I did not conceal from him, what\r\nindeed was the fact, that I was undertaking this journey under great\r\ndifficulties, as under the circumstances I considered it impossible to\r\nwait to have my passport endorsed by the French envoy. At the same time\r\nI wrote a few lines to Mme. Laussot, exhorting her to be calm and\r\nself-possessed, but, true to my purpose, refrained from even hinting at\r\nany movement on my part. (When, years afterwards, I told Liszt this\r\nstory, he declared I had acted very stupidly in not, telling Mme.\r\nLaussot of my intentions.) I took leave of Karl the same day, in order\r\nto set out next morning from Geneva on my tedious journey across\r\nFrance. But I was so exhausted by all this that I could not help\r\nthinking I was going to die. That same night I wrote to Frau Ritter in\r\nDresden, to this effect, giving her a short account of the incredible\r\ndifficulties I had been drawn into. As a matter of fact, I suffered\r\ngreat inconvenience at the French frontier on account of my passport; I\r\nwas made to give my exact place of destination, and it was only upon my\r\nassuring them that pressing family affairs required my immediate\r\npresence, that the authorities showed exceptional leniency and allowed\r\nme to proceed.\r\n\r\nI travelled by Lyons through Auvergne by stage-coach for three days and\r\ntwo nights, till at length I reached Bordeaux. It was the middle of\r\nMay, and as I surveyed the town from a height at early dawn I saw it\r\nlit up by a fire that had broken out. I alighted at the Hotel Quatre\r\nSoeurs, and at once sent a note to M. Laussot, informing him that I\r\nheld myself at his disposal and would remain in all day to receive him.\r\nIt was nine o’clock in the morning when I sent him this message. I\r\nwaited in vain for an answer, till at last, late in the afternoon, I\r\nreceived a summons from the police-station to present myself\r\nimmediately. There I was first of all asked whether my passport was in\r\norder. I acknowledged the difficulty I found myself in with regard to\r\nit, and explained that family matters had necessitated my placing\r\nmyself in this position.\r\n\r\nI was thereupon informed that precisely this family matter, which had\r\nno doubt brought me there, was the cause of their having to deny me the\r\npermission to remain in Bordeaux any longer. In answer to my question,\r\nthey did not conceal the fact that these proceedings against me were\r\nbeing carried out at the express wish of the family concerned. This\r\nextraordinary revelation immediately restored my good-humour. I asked\r\nthe police inspector whether, after such a trying journey, I might not\r\nbe allowed a couple of days’ rest before returning; this request he\r\nreadily granted, and told me that in any case there could be no chance\r\nof my meeting the family in question, as they had left Bordeaux at\r\nmid-day. I used these two days to recover from my fatigue, and also\r\nwrote a letter to Jessie, in which I told her exactly what had taken\r\nplace, without concealing my contempt at the behaviour of her husband,\r\nwho could expose his wife’s honour by a denunciation to the police. I\r\nalso added that our friendship could certainly not continue until she\r\nhad released herself from so humiliating a position. The next thing was\r\nto get this letter safely delivered. The information furnished me by\r\nthe police officials was not sufficient to enlighten me as to what had\r\nexactly taken place in the Laussot family, whether they had left home\r\nfor some length of time or merely for a day, so I simply made up my\r\nmind to go to their house. I rang the bell and the door sprang open;\r\nwithout meeting any one I walked up to the first-floor flat, the door\r\nof which stood open, and went from room to room till I reached Jessie’s\r\nboudoir, where I placed my letter in her work-basket and returned the\r\nway I had come. I received no reply, and set out upon my return journey\r\nas soon as the term of rest granted me had expired. The fine May\r\nweather had a cheering effect upon me, and the clear water, as well as\r\nthe agreeable name of the Dordogne, along whose banks the post-chaise\r\ntravelled for some distance, gave me great pleasure.\r\n\r\nI was also entertained by the conversation of two fellow-travellers, a\r\npriest and an officer, about the necessity of putting an end to the\r\nFrench Republic. The priest showed himself much more humane and\r\nbroad-minded than his military interlocutor, who could only repeat the\r\none refrain, ‘Il faut en finir.’ I now had a look at Lyons, and in a\r\nwalk round the town tried to recall the scenes in Lamartine’s Histoire\r\ndes Girondins, where he so vividly describes the siege and surrender of\r\nthe town during the period of the Convention Nationale. At last I\r\narrived at Geneva, and returned to the Byron hotel, where Karl Hitter\r\nwas awaiting me. During my absence he had heard from his family, who\r\nwrote very kindly concerning me. His mother had at once reassured him\r\nas to my condition, and pointed out that with people suffering from\r\nnervous disorders the idea of approaching death was a frequent symptom,\r\nand that there was consequently no occasion to feel anxious about me.\r\nShe also announced her intention of coming to visit us in Villeneuve\r\nwith her daughter Emilie in a few days’ time. This news made me take\r\nheart again; this devoted family, so solicitous for my welfare, seemed\r\nsent by Providence to lead me, as I so longed to be led, to a new life.\r\nBoth ladies arrived in time to celebrate my thirty-seventh birthday on\r\nthe twenty-second of May. The mother, Frau Julie, particularly made a\r\ndeep impression upon me. I had only met her once before in Dresden,\r\nwhen Karl had invited me to be present at the performance of a\r\nquartette of his own composition, given at his mother’s house. On this\r\noccasion the respect and devotion shown me by each member of the family\r\nhad delighted me. The mother had hardly spoken to me, but when I was\r\nleaving she was moved to tears as she thanked me for my visit. I was\r\nunable to understand her emotion at the time, but now when I reminded\r\nher of it she was surprised, and explained that she had felt so touched\r\nat my unexpected kindness to her son.\r\n\r\nShe and her daughter remained with us about a week. We sought diversion\r\nin excursions to the beautiful Valais, but did not succeed in\r\ndispelling Frau Hitter’s sadness of heart, caused by the knowledge of\r\nrecent events of which she had now been informed, as well as by her\r\nanxiety at the course my life was taking. As I afterwards learned, it\r\nhad cost the nervous, delicate woman a great effort to undertake this\r\njourney, and when I urged her to leave her house to come and settle in\r\nSwitzerland with her family, so that we might all be united, she at\r\nlast pointed out to me that in proposing what seemed to her such an\r\neccentric undertaking, I was counting upon a strength and energy she no\r\nlonger possessed. For the present she commended her son, whom she\r\nwished to leave with me, to my care, and gave me the necessary means to\r\nkeep us both for the time being. Regarding the state of her fortune,\r\nshe told me that her income was limited, and now that it was impossible\r\nto accept any help from the Laussots, she did not know how she would be\r\nable to come to my assistance sufficiently to assure my independence.\r\nDeeply moved, we took leave of this venerable woman at the end of a\r\nweek, and she returned to Dresden with her daughter, and I never saw\r\nher again.\r\n\r\nStill bent upon discovering a means of disappearing from the world, I\r\nthought of choosing a wild mountain spot where I could retire with\r\nKarl. For this purpose we sought the lonely Visper Thal in the canton\r\nValais, and not without difficulty made our way along the impracticable\r\nroads to Zermatt. There, at the foot of the colossal and beautiful\r\nMatterhorn, we could indeed consider ourselves cut off from the outer\r\nworld. I tried to make things as comfortable as I could in this\r\nprimitive wilderness, but discovered only too soon that Karl could not\r\nreconcile himself to his surroundings. Even on the second day he owned\r\nthat he thought it horrid, and suggested that it would be more pleasant\r\nin the neighbourhood of one of the lakes. We studied the map of\r\nSwitzerland, and chose Thun for our next destination. Unfortunately I\r\nagain found myself reduced to a state of extreme nervous fatigue, in\r\nwhich the slightest effort produced a profuse and weakening\r\nperspiration. Only by the greatest strength of will was I able to make\r\nmy way out of the valley; but at last we reached Thun, and with renewed\r\ncourage engaged a couple of modest but cheerful rooms looking out on to\r\nthe road, and proposed to wait and see how we should like it. In spite\r\nof the reserve which still betrayed his shyness of character, I found\r\nconversation with my young friend always pleasant and enlivening. I now\r\nrealised the pitch of fluent and overflowing vivacity to which the\r\nyoung man could attain, particularly at night before retiring to rest,\r\nwhen he would squat down beside my bed, and in the agreeable, pure\r\ndialect of the German Baltic provinces, give free expression to\r\nwhatever had excited his interest. I was exceedingly cheered during\r\nthese days by the perusal of the Odyssey, which I had not read for so\r\nlong and which had fallen into my hands by chance. Homer’s\r\nlong-suffering hero, always homesick yet condemned to perpetual\r\nwandering, and always valiantly overcoming all difficulties, was\r\nstrangely sympathetic to me. Suddenly the peaceful state I had scarcely\r\nyet entered upon was disturbed by a letter which Karl received from\r\nMme. Laussot. He did not know whether he ought to show it to me, as he\r\nthought Jessie had gone mad. I tore it out of his hand, and found she\r\nhad written to say that she felt obliged to let my friend know that she\r\nhad been sufficiently enlightened about me to make her drop my\r\nacquaintance entirely. I afterwards discovered, chiefly through the\r\nhelp of Frau Ritter, that in consequence of my letter and my arrival in\r\nBordeaux, M. Laussot, together with Mrs. Taylor, had immediately taken\r\nJessie to the country, intending to remain there until the news was\r\nreceived of my departure, to accelerate which he had applied to the\r\npolice authorities. While they were away, and without telling her of my\r\nletter and my journey, they had obtained a promise from the young woman\r\nto remain quiet for a year, give up her visit to Dresden, and, above\r\nall, to drop all correspondence with me; since, under these conditions,\r\nshe was promised her entire freedom at the end of that time, she had\r\nthought it better to give her word. Not content with this, however, the\r\ntwo conspirators had immediately set about calumniating me on all\r\nsides, and finally to Mme. Laussot herself, saying that I was the\r\ninitiator of this plan of elopement. Mrs. Taylor had written to my wife\r\ncomplaining of my intention to commit adultery, at the same time\r\nexpressing her pity for her and offering her support; the unfortunate\r\nMinna, who now thought she had found a hitherto unsuspected reason for\r\nmy resolve to remain separated from her, wrote back complaining of me\r\nto Mrs. Taylor. The meaning of an innocent remark I had once made had\r\nbeen strangely misinterpreted, and matters wore now aggravated by\r\nmaking it appear as though I had intentionally lied. In the course of\r\nplayful conversation Jessie had once told me that she belonged to no\r\nrecognised form of religion, her father Having teen a member of a\r\ncertain sect which did not baptise either according to the Protestant\r\nor the Roman Catholic ritual; whereupon I had comforted her by assuring\r\nher that I had come in contact with much more questionable sects, as\r\nshortly after my marriage in Königsberg I had learned that it had been\r\nsolemnised by a hypocrite. God alone knows in what form this had been\r\nrepeated to the worthy British matron, but, at all events, she told my\r\nwife that I had said I was ‘not legally married to her.’ In any case,\r\nmy wife’s answer to this had no doubt furnished further material with\r\nwhich to poison Jessie’s mind against me, and this letter to my young\r\nfriend was the result. I must admit that, seen by this light, the\r\ncircumstance at which I felt most indignant was the way my wife had\r\nbeen treated, and while I was perfectly indifferent as to what the rest\r\nof the party thought of me, I immediately accepted Karl’s offer to go\r\nto Zürich and see her, so as to give her the explanation necessary to\r\nher peace of mind. While awaiting his return, I received a letter from\r\nLiszt, telling me of the deep impression made upon him by my Lohengrin\r\nscore, which had caused him to make up his mind as to the future in\r\nstore for me. He at the same time announced that, as I had given him\r\nthe permission to do so, he intended doing all in his power to bring\r\nabout the production of my opera at the forthcoming Herder festival in\r\nWeimar. About this time I also heard from Frau Ritter, who, in\r\nconsequence of events of which she was well aware, thought herself\r\ncalled upon to beg me not to take the matter too much to heart. At this\r\nmoment Karl also returned from Zürich, and spoke with great warmth of\r\nmy wife’s attitude. Not having found me in Paris, she had pulled\r\nherself together with remarkable energy, and in pursuance of an earlier\r\nwish of mine, had rented a house on the lake of Zürich, installed\r\nherself comfortably, and remained there in the hope of at last hearing\r\nfrom me again. Besides this, he had much to tell me of Sulzer’s good\r\nsense and friendliness, the latter having stood by, my wife and shown\r\nher great sympathy. In the midst of his narrative Karl suddenly\r\nexclaimed, ‘Ah! these could be called sensible people; but with such a\r\nmad Englishwoman nothing could be done.’ To all this I said not a word,\r\nbut finally with a smile asked him whether he would like to go over to\r\nZürich? He sprang up exclaiming, ‘Yes, and as soon as possible.’ ‘You\r\nshall have your way,’ said I; ‘let us pack. I can see no sense in\r\nanything either here or there.’ Without breathing another syllable\r\nabout all that had happened, we left the next day for Zürich.", "chapters": [{"title": "IN TWO VOLUMES", "startIndex": 5}, {"title": "AUTHORIZED TRANSLATION FROM THE GERMAN", "startIndex": 10}, {"title": "PREFACE", "startIndex": 16}, {"title": "CONTENTS", "startIndex": 17}, {"title": "MY LIFE", "startIndex": 18}, {"title": "PART I. 1813-1842", "startIndex": 20}, {"title": "PART II. 1842-1850 (Dresden)", "startIndex": 23}, {"title": "PREFACE", "startIndex": 27}, {"title": "CONTENTS", "startIndex": 237}, {"title": "Part I. 1813-1842", "startIndex": 238}, {"title": "Part II. 1842-1850 (Dresden)", "startIndex": 253}, {"title": "ILLUSTRATIONS", "startIndex": 311}, {"title": "FRONTISPIECE FOR VOLUME I", "startIndex": 312}, {"title": "FRONTISPIECE FOR VOLUME II", "startIndex": 327}, {"title": "MY LIFE", "startIndex": 356}, {"title": "PART I", "startIndex": 358}, {"title": "part in all that he has just forbidden.
