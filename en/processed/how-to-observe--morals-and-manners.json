On consideration,\nhowever, it was determined somewhat to extend the plan, and to separate\nthe great divisions of the field of observation, so that those whose\ntastes led them to one particular branch of inquiry might not be\nencumbered with other parts in which they do not feel an equal\ninterest.\"\n\nThe preceding passage is contained in the notice accompanying the first\nwork in this series--Geology, by Mr. De la Bèche, published in 1835.\nThus, the second work in the series is in continuation of the plan above\nannounced.\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n PART I.

A child does not catch a\ngold fish in water at the first trial, however good his eyes may be, and\nhowever clear the water; knowledge and method are necessary to enable\nhim to take what is actually before his eyes and under his hand. So it\nis with all who fish in a strange element for the truth which is living\nand moving there: the powers of observation must be trained, and habits\nof method in arranging the materials presented to the eye must be\nacquired before the student possesses the requisites for understanding\nwhat he contemplates.\n\nThe observer of Men and Manners stands as much in need of intellectual\npreparation as any other student. This is not, indeed, generally\nsupposed, and a multitude of travellers act as if it were not true. Of\nthe large number of tourists who annually sail from our ports, there is\nprobably not one who would dream of pretending to make observations on\nany subject of physical inquiry, of which he did not understand even the\nprinciples. If, on his return from the Mediterranean, the unprepared\ntraveller was questioned about the geology of Corsica, or the public\nbuildings of Palermo, he would reply, \"Oh, I can tell you nothing about\nthat--I never studied geology; I know nothing about architecture.\" But\nfew, or none, make the same avowal about the morals and manners of a\nnation. Every man seems to imagine that he can understand men at a\nglance; he supposes that it is enough to be among them to know what they\nare doing; he thinks that eyes, ears, and memory are enough for morals,\nthough they would not qualify him for botanical or statistical\nobservation; he pronounces confidently upon the merits and social\ncondition of the nations among whom he has travelled; no misgiving ever\nprompts him to say, \"I can give you little general information about the\npeople I have been seeing; I have not studied the principles of morals;\nI am no judge of national manners.\"\n\nThere would be nothing to be ashamed of in such an avowal. No wise man\nblushes at being ignorant of any science which it has not suited his\npurposes to study, or which it has not been in his power to attain. No\nlinguist wrings his hands when astronomical discoveries are talked of in\nhis presence; no political economist covers his face when shown a shell\nor a plant which he cannot class; still less should the artist, the\nnatural philosopher, the commercial traveller, or the classical scholar,\nbe ashamed to own himself unacquainted with the science which, of all\nthe sciences which have yet opened upon men, is, perhaps, the least\ncultivated, the least definite, the least ascertained in itself, and the\nmost difficult in its application.\n\nIn this last characteristic of the science of Morals lies the excuse of\nas many travellers as may decline pronouncing on the social condition of\nany people. Even if the generality of travellers were as enlightened as\nthey are at present ignorant about the principles of Morals, the\ndifficulty of putting those principles to interpretative uses would\ndeter the wise from making the hasty decisions, and uttering the large\njudgments, in which travellers have hitherto been wont to indulge. In\nproportion as men become sensible how infinite are the diversities in\nman, how incalculable the varieties and influences of circumstances,\nrashness of pretension and decision will abate, and the great work of\nclassifying the moral manifestations of society will be confided to the\nphilosophers, who bear the same relation to the science of society as\nHerschel does to astronomy, and Beaufort to hydrography.\n\nOf all the tourists who utter their decisions upon foreigners, how many\nhave begun their researches at home? Which of them would venture upon\ngiving an account of the morals and manners of London, though he may\nhave lived in it all his life? Would any one of them escape errors as\ngross as those of the Frenchman who published it as a general fact that\npeople in London always have, at dinner parties, soup on each side, and\nfish at four corners? Which of us would undertake to classify the morals\nand manners of any hamlet in England, after spending the summer in it?\nWhat sensible man seriously generalizes upon the manners of a street,\neven though it be Houndsditch or Cranbourn-Alley? Who pretends to\nexplain all the proceedings of his next-door neighbour? Who is able to\naccount for all that is said and done by the dweller in the same\nhouse,--by parent, child, brother, or domestic? If such judgments were\nattempted, would they not be as various as those who make them? And\nwould they not, after all, if closely looked into, reveal more of the\nmind of the observer than of the observed?\n\nIf it be thus with us at home, amidst all the general resemblances, the\nprevalent influences which furnish an interpretation to a large number\nof facts, what hope of a trustworthy judgment remains for the foreign\ntourist, however good may be his method of travelling, and however long\nhis absence from home? He looks at all the people along his line of\nroad, and converses with a few individuals from among them. If he\ndiverges, from time to time, from the high road,--if he winds about\namong villages, and crosses mountains, to dip into the hamlets of the\nvalleys,--he still pursues only a line, and does not command the\nexpanse; he is furnished, at best, with no more than a sample of the\npeople; and whether they be indeed a sample, must remain a conjecture\nwhich he has no means of verifying. He converses, more or less, with,\nperhaps, one man in ten thousand of those he sees; and of the few with\nwhom he converses, no two are alike in powers and in training, or\nperfectly agree in their views on any one of the great subjects which\nthe traveller professes to observe; the information afforded by one is\ncontradicted by another; the fact of one day is proved error by the\nnext; the wearied mind soon finds itself overwhelmed by the multitude of\nunconnected or contradictory particulars, and lies passive to be run\nover by the crowd. The tourist is no more likely to learn, in this way,\nthe social state of a nation, than his valet would be qualified to speak\nof the meteorology of the country from the number of times the umbrellas\nwere wanted in the course of two months. His children might as well\nundertake to exhibit the geological formation of the country from the\npebbles they picked up in a day's ride.\n\nI remember some striking words addressed to me, before I set out on my\ntravels, by a wise man, since dead. \"You are going to spend two years in\nthe United States,\" said he. \"Now just tell me,--do you expect to\nunderstand the Americans by the time you come back? You do not: that is\nwell. I lived five-and-twenty years in Scotland, and I fancied I\nunderstood the Scotch; then I came to England, and supposed I should\nsoon understand the English. I have now lived five-and-twenty years\nhere, and I begin to think I understand neither the Scotch nor the\nEnglish.\"\n\nWhat is to be done? Let us first settle what is not to be done.\n\nThe traveller must deny himself all indulgence of peremptory decision,\nnot only in public on his return, but in his journal, and in his most\nsuperficial thoughts. The experienced and conscientious traveller would\nword the condition differently. Finding peremptory decision more trying\nto his conscience than agreeable to his laziness, he would call it not\nindulgence, but anxiety; he enjoys the employment of collecting\nmaterials, but would shrink from the responsibility of judging a\ncommunity.\n\nThe traveller must not generalize on the spot, however true may be his\napprehension--however firm his grasp, of one or more facts. A raw\nEnglish traveller in China was entertained by a host who was\nintoxicated, and a hostess who was red-haired; he immediately made a\nnote of the fact that all the men in China were drunkards, and all the\nwomen red-haired. A raw Chinese traveller in England was landed by a\nThames waterman who had a wooden leg. The stranger saw that the wooden\nleg was used to stand in the water with, while the other was high and\ndry. The apparent economy of the fact struck the Chinese; he saw in it\nstrong evidence of design, and wrote home that in England one-legged men\nare kept for watermen, to the saving of all injury to health, shoe, and\nstocking, from standing in the river. These anecdotes exhibit but a\nslight exaggeration of the generalizing tendencies of many modern\ntravellers. They are not so much worse than some recent tourists' tales,\nas they are better than the old narratives of \"men whose heads do grow\nbeneath their shoulders.\"\n\nNatural philosophers do not dream of generalizing with any such speed as\nthat used by the observers of men; yet they might do it with more\nsafety, at the risk of an incalculably smaller mischief. The geologist\nand the chemist make a large collection of particular appearances,\nbefore they commit themselves to propound a principle drawn from them,\nthough their subject matter is far less diversified than the human\nsubject, and nothing of so much importance as human emotions,--love and\ndislike, reverence and contempt, depends upon their judgment. If a\nstudent in natural philosophy is in too great haste to classify and\ninterpret, he misleads, for a while, his fellow-students (not a very\nlarge class); he vitiates the observations of a few successors; his\nerror is discovered and exposed; he is mortified, and his too docile\nfollowers are ridiculed, and there is an end; but if a traveller gives\nany quality which he may have observed in a few individuals as a\ncharacteristic of a nation, the evil is not speedily or easily\nremediable. Abject thinkers, passive readers, adopt his words; parents\nrepeat them to their children; and townspeople spread the judgment into\nthe villages and hamlets--the strongholds of prejudice; future\ntravellers see according to the prepossessions given them, and add their\ntestimony to the error, till it becomes the work of a century to reverse\na hasty generalization. It was a great mistake of a geologist to assign\na wrong level to the Caspian Sea; and it is vexatious that much time and\nenergy should have been devoted to account for an appearance which,\nafter all, does not exist. It is provoking to geologists that they\nshould have wasted a great deal of ingenuity in finding reasons for\nthese waters being at a different level from what it is now found that\nthey have; but the evil is over; the \"pish!\" and the \"pshaw!\" are said;\nthe explanatory and apologetical notes are duly inserted in new\neditions of geological works, and nothing more can come of the mistake.\nBut it is difficult to foresee when the British public will believe that\nthe Americans are a mirthful nation, or even that the French are not\nalmost all cooks or dancing-masters. A century hence, probably, the\nAmericans will continue to believe that all the English make a regular\nstudy of the art of conversation; and the lower orders of French will be\nstill telling their children that half the people in England hang or\ndrown themselves every November. As long as travellers generalize on\nmorals and manners as hastily as they do, it will probably be impossible\nto establish a general conviction that no civilized nation is\nascertainably better or worse than any other on this side barbarism, the\nwhole field of morals being taken into the view. As long as travellers\ncontinue to neglect the safe means of generalization which are within\nthe reach of all, and build theories upon the manifestations of\nindividual minds, there is little hope of inspiring men with that spirit\nof impartiality, mutual deference, and love, which are the best\nenlighteners of the eyes and rectifiers of the understanding.\n\nAbove all things, the traveller must not despair of good results from\nhis observations. Because he cannot establish true conclusions by\nimperfect means, he is not to desist from doing anything at all. Because\nhe cannot safely generalize in one way, it does not follow that there is\nno other way. There are methods of safe generalization of which I shall\nspeak by-and-by. But, if there were not such within his reach, if his\nonly materials were the discourse, the opinions, the feelings, the way\nof life, the looks, dress, and manners of individuals, he might still\nafford important contributions to science by his observations on as wide\na variety of these as he can bring within his mental grasp. The\nexperience of a large number of observers would in time yield materials\nfrom which a cautious philosopher might draw conclusions. It is a safe\nrule, in morals as in physics, that no fact is without its use. Every\nobserver and recorder is fulfilling a function; and no one observer or\nrecorder ought to feel discouragement, as long as he desires to be\nuseful rather than shining; to be the servant rather than the lord of\nscience, and a friend to the home-stayers rather than their dictator.\n\nOne of the wisest men living writes to me, \"No books are so little to be\ntrusted as travels. All travellers do and must generalize too rapidly.\nMost, if not all, take a fact for a principle, or the exception for the\nrule, more or less; and the quickest minds, which love to reason and\nexplain more than to observe with patience, go most astray. My faith in\ntravels received a mortal wound when I travelled. I read, as I went\nalong, the books of those who had preceded me, and found that we did not\nsee with the same eyes. Even descriptions of nature proved false. The\ntraveller had viewed the prospect at a different season, or in a\ndifferent light, and substituted the transient for the fixed. Still I\nthink travels useful. Different accounts give means of approximation to\ntruth; and by-and-by what is fixed and essential in a people will be\nbrought out.\"\n\nIt ought to be an animating thought to a traveller that, even if it be\nnot in his power to settle any one point respecting the morals and\nmanners of an empire, he can infallibly aid in supplying means of\napproximation to truth, and of bringing out \"what is fixed and essential\nin a people.\" This should be sufficient to stimulate his exertions and\nsatisfy his ambition.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nPHILOSOPHICAL REQUISITES.\n\n \"Only I believe that this is not a bow for every man to shoot in\n that counts himself a teacher, but will require sinews almost\n equal to those which Homer gave Ulysses; yet I am withal\n persuaded that it may prove much more easy in the essay than it\n now seems at a distance.\"--MILTON.\n\nThere are two parties to the work of observation on Morals and\nManners--the observer and the observed. This is an important fact which\nthe traveller seldom dwells upon as he ought; yet a moment's\nconsideration shows that the mind of the observer--the instrument by\nwhich the work is done, is as essential as the material to be wrought.\nIf the instrument be in bad order, it will furnish a bad product, be the\nmaterial what it may. In this chapter I shall point out what requisites\nthe traveller ought to make sure that he is possessed of before he\nundertakes to offer observations on the Morals and Manners of a people.\n\nSECTION I.\n\nHe must have made up his mind as to what it is that he wants to know. In\nphysical science, great results may be obtained by hap-hazard\nexperiments; but this is not the case in Morals. A chemist can hardly\nfail of learning something by putting any substances together, under new\ncircumstances, and seeing what will arise out of the combination; and\nsome striking discoveries happened in this way, in the infancy of the\nscience; though no one doubts that more knowledge may be gained by the\nchemist who has an aim in his mind, and who conducts his experiment on\nsome principle. In Morals, the latter method is the only one which\npromises any useful results. In the workings of the social system, all\nthe agents are known in the gross--all are determined. It is not their\nnature, but the proportions in which they are combined, which have to be\nascertained.\n\nWhat does the traveller want to know? He is aware that, wherever he\ngoes, he will find men, women, and children; strong men and weak men;\njust men and selfish men. He knows that he will everywhere find a\nnecessity for food, clothing, and shelter; and everywhere some mode of\ngeneral agreement how to live together. He knows that he will everywhere\nfind birth, marriage, and death; and therefore domestic affections. What\nresults from all these elements of social life does he mean to look for?\n\nFor want of settling this question, one traveller sees nothing truly,\nbecause the state of things is not consistent with his speculations as\nto how human beings ought to live together; another views the whole with\nprejudice, because it is not like what he has been accustomed to see at\nhome; yet each of these would shrink from the recognition of his folly,\nif it were fully placed before him. The first would be ashamed of having\ntried any existing community by an arbitrary standard of his own--an act\nmuch like going forth into the wilderness to see kings' houses full of\nmen in soft raiment; and the other would perceive that different\nnations may go on judging one another by themselves till doomsday,\nwithout in any way improving the chance of self-advancement and mutual\nunderstanding. Going out with the disadvantage of a habit of mind\nuncounteracted by an intellectual aim, will never do. The traveller may\nas well stay at home, for anything he will gain in the way of social\nknowledge.\n\nThe two considerations just mentioned must be subordinated to the grand\none,--the only general one,--of the relative amount of human happiness.\nEvery element of social life derives its importance from this great\nconsideration. The external conveniences of men, their internal emotions\nand affections, their social arrangements, graduate in importance\nprecisely in proportion as they affect the general happiness of the\nsection of the race among whom they exist. Here then is the wise\ntraveller's aim,--to be kept in view to the exclusion of prejudice, both\nphilosophical and national. He must not allow himself to be perplexed or\ndisgusted by seeing the great ends of human association pursued by means\nwhich he could never have devised, and to the practice of which he could\nnot reconcile himself. He is not to conclude unfavourably about the diet\nof the multitude because he sees them swallowing blubber, or scooping\nout water-melons, instead of regaling themselves with beef and beer. He\nis not to suppose their social meetings a failure because they eat with\ntheir fingers instead of with silver forks, or touch foreheads instead\nof making a bow. He is not to conclude against domestic morals, on\naccount of a diversity of methods of entering upon marriage. He might\nas well judge of the minute transactions of manners all over the world\nby what he sees in his native village. There, to leave the door open or\nto shut it bears no relation to morals, and but little to manners;\nwhereas, to shut the door is as cruel an act in a Hindoo hut as to leave\nit open in a Greenland cabin. In short, he is to prepare himself to\nbring whatever he may observe to the test of some high and broad\nprinciple, and not to that of a low comparative practice. To test one\npeople by another, is to argue within a very small segment of a circle;\nand the observer can only pass backwards and forwards at an equal\ndistance from the point of truth. To test the morals and manners of a\nnation by a reference to the essentials of human happiness, is to strike\nat once to the centre, and to see things as they are.\n\nSECTION II.\n\nBeing provided with a conviction of what it is that he wants to know,\nthe traveller must be furthermore furnished with the means of gaining\nthe knowledge he wants. When he was a child, he was probably taught that\neyes, ears, and understanding are all-sufficient to gain for him as much\nknowledge as he will have time to acquire; but his self-education has\nbeen a poor one, if he has not become convinced that something more is\nneedful--the enlightenment and discipline of the understanding, as well\nas its immediate use. It is not enough for a traveller to have an active\nunderstanding, equal to an accurate perception of individual facts in\nthemselves; he must also be in possession of principles which may serve\nas a rallying point for his observations, and without which he cannot\ndetermine their bearings, or be secure of putting a right interpretation\nupon them. A traveller may do better without eyes, or without ears, than\nwithout such principles, as there is evidence to prove. Holman, the\nblind traveller, gains a wonderful amount of information, though he is\nshut out from the evidence yielded by the human countenance, by way-side\ngroups, by the aspect of cities, and the varying phenomena of country\nregions. In his motto, he indicates something of his method.\n\n \"Sightless to see, and judge thro' judgment's eyes,\n To make four senses do the work of five,\n To arm the mind for hopeful enterprise,\n Are lights to him who doth in darkness live.\"\n\nIn order to \"judge through judgment's eyes,\" those eyes must be made\nstrong and clear; and a traveller may gain more without the bodily organ\nthan with an untrained understanding. The case of the Deaf Traveller[A]\nleads us to say the same about the other great avenue of knowledge. His\nwritings prove, to all who are acquainted with them, that, though to a\ngreat degree deprived of that inestimable commentary upon perceived\nfacts--human discourse--the Deaf Traveller is able to furnish us with\nmore knowledge of foreign people than Fine-Ear himself could have done\nwithout the accompaniments of analytical power and concentrative\nthought. All senses, and intellectual powers, and good habits, may be\nconsidered essential to a perfect observation of morals and manners; but\nalmost any one might be better spared than a provision of principles\nwhich may serve as a rallying point and a test of facts. The blind and\nthe deaf travellers must suffer under a deprivation or deficiency of\ncertain classes of facts. The condition of the unphilosophical traveller\nis much worse. It is a chance whether he puts a right interpretation on\nany of the facts he perceives.\n\nMany may object that I am making much too serious a matter of the\ndepartment of the business of travelling under present notice. They do\nnot pretend to be moral philosophers;--they do not desire to be\noracles;--they attempt nothing more than to give a simple report of what\nhas come under their notice. But what work on earth is more serious than\nthis of giving an account of the most grave and important things which\nare transacted on this globe? Every true report is a great good; every\nuntrue report is a great mischief. Therefore, let there be none given\nbut by persons in some good degree qualified. Such travellers as will\nnot take pains to provide themselves with the requisite thought and\nstudy should abstain from reporting at all.\n\nIt is a mistake, however, to suppose that the study shown to be\nrequisite is vast and deep. Some knowledge of the principles of Morals\nand the rule of Manners is required, as in the case of other sciences to\nbe brought into use on a similar occasion; but the principles are few\nand simple, and the rule easy of application.\n\nThe universal summary notions of Morals may serve a common traveller in\nhis judgments as to whether he would like to live in any foreign\ncountry, and as to whether the people there are as agreeable to him as\nhis own nation. For such an one it may be sufficient to bear about the\ngeneral notions that lying, thieving, idleness, and licentiousness are\nbad; and that truth, honesty, industry, and sobriety are good; and for\ncommon purposes, such an one may be trusted to pronounce what is\nindustry and what idleness; what is licentiousness and what sobriety.\nBut vague notions, home prepossessions, even on these great points of\nmorals, are not sufficient, in the eyes of an enlightened traveller, to\nwarrant decisions on the moral state of nations who are reared under a\nwide diversity of circumstances. The true liberality which alone is\nworthy to contemplate all the nations of the earth, does not draw a\nbroad line through the midst of human conduct, declaring all that falls\non the one side vice, and all on the other virtue; such a liberality\nknows that actions and habits do not always carry their moral impress\nvisibly to all eyes, and that the character of very many must be\ndetermined by a cautious application of a few deep principles. Is the\nShaker of New England a good judge of the morals and manners of the Arab\nof the Desert? What sort of a verdict would the shrewdest gipsy pass\nupon the monk of La Trappe? What would the Scotch peasant think of the\nmagical practices of Egypt? or the Russian soldier of a meeting of\nelectors in the United States? The ideas of right and wrong in the minds\nof these people are not of the enlarged kind which would enable them to\njudge persons in situations the most opposite to their own. The true\nphilosopher, the worthy observer, first contemplates in imagination the\narea of humanity, and then ascertains what principles of morals are\napplicable to them all, and judges by these.\n\nThe enlightened traveller, if he explore only one country, carries in\nhis mind the image of all; for, only in its relation to the whole of the\nrace can any one people be judged. Almost without exaggeration, he may\nbe said to see what the rhapsodist in Volney saw.\n\n\"There, from above the atmosphere, looking down upon the earth I had\nquitted, I beheld a scene entirely new. Under my feet, floating in empty\nspace, a globe similar to that of the moon, but less luminous, presented\nto me one of its faces.... 'What!' exclaimed I, 'is that the earth which\nis inhabited by human beings?'\"[B]\n\nThe differences are, that, instead of \"one of its faces,\" the moralist\nwould see the whole of the earth in one contemplation; and that, instead\nof a nebulous expanse here, and a brown or grey speck there,--continents,\nseas, or volcanoes,--he would look into the homes and social assemblies\nof all lands. In the extreme North, there is the snow-hut of the\nEsquimaux, shining with the fire within, like an alabaster lamp left\nburning in a wide waste; within, the beardless father is mending his\nweapons made of fishbones, while the dwarfed mother swathes her infant in\nskins, and feeds it with oil and fat. In the extreme East, there is the\nChinese family in their garden, treading its paved walks, or seated under\nthe shade of its artificial rocks; the master displaying the claws of his\nleft hand as he smokes his pipe, and his wife tottering on her deformed\nfeet as she follows her child,--exulting over it if it be a boy; grave\nand full of sighs if heaven have sent her none but girls. In the extreme\nSouth, there is the Colonist of the Cape, lazily basking before his door,\nwhile he sends his labourer abroad with his bullock-waggon, devolves the\nbusiness of the farm upon the women, and scares from his door any poor\nHottentot who may have wandered hither over the plain. In the extreme\nWest, there is the gathering together on the shores of the Pacific of the\nhunters laden with furs. The men are trading, or cleaning their arms, or\nsleeping; the squaws are cooking, or dyeing with vegetable juices the\nquills of the porcupine or the hair of the moose-deer. In the intervals\nbetween these extremities, there is a world of morals and manners, as\ndiverse as the surface of the lands on which they are exhibited. Here is\nthe Russian nobleman on his estate, the lord of the fate of his serfs,\nbut hard pressed by the enmity of rival nobles, and silenced by the\ndespotism of his prince; his wife leads a languid life among her spinning\nmaidens; and his young sons talk of the wars in which they shall serve\ntheir emperor in time to come. There is the Frankfort trader, dwelling\namong equals, fixing his pride upon having wronged no man, or upon having\na son distinguished at the university, or a daughter skilled in domestic\naccomplishments; while his wife emulates her neighbours in supporting the\ncomfort and respectability of the household. Here is the French peasant\nreturning from the field in total ignorance of what has taken place in\nthe capital of late; and there is the English artizan discussing with his\nbrother-workman the politics of the town, or carrying home to his wife\nsome fresh hopes of the interference of parliament about labour and\nwages. Here is a conclave of Cardinals, consulting upon the interests of\nthe Holy See; there a company of Brahmins setting an offering of rice\nbefore their idol. In one direction, there is a handful of citizens\nbuilding a new town in the midst of a forest; in another, there is a\ntroop of horsemen hovering on the horizon, while a caravan is traversing\nthe Desert. Under the twinkling shadows of a German vineyard, national\nsongs are sung; from the steep places of the Swiss mountains the Alp-horn\nresounds; in the coffee-house at Cairo, listeners hang upon the voice of\nthe romance reciter; the churches of Italy echo with solemn hymns; and\nthe soft tones of the child are heard, in the New England parlour, as the\nyoung scholar reads the Bible to parent or aged grandfather.\n\nAll these, and more, will a traveller of the most enlightened order\nrevolve before his mind's eye as he notes the groups which are presented\nto his senses. Of such travellers there are but too few; and vague and\ngeneral, or merely traditional, notions of right and wrong must serve\nthe purpose of the greater number. The chief evil of moral notions being\nvague or traditional is, that they are irreconcileable with liberality\nof judgment; and the great benefit of an ascertainment of the primary\nprinciples of morals is, that such an investigation dissolves prejudice,\nand casts a full light upon many things which cease to be fearful and\npainful when they are no longer obscure. We all know how different a\nSunday in Paris appears to a sectarian, to whom the word of his priest\nis law; and to a philosopher, in whom religion is indigenous, who\nunderstands the narrowness of sects, and sees how much smaller even\nChristendom itself is than Humanity. We all know how offensive the\nprayers of Mahomedans at the corners of streets, and the pomp of\ncatholic processions, are to those who know no other way than entering\ninto their closet, and shutting the door when they pray; but how felt\nthe deep thinker who wrote the Religio Medici? He was an orderly member\nof a Protestant church, yet he uncovered his head at the sight of a\ncrucifix; he could not laugh at pilgrims walking with peas in their\nshoes, or despise a begging friar; he could \"not hear an Ave Maria bell\nwithout an elevation;\" and it is probable that even the Teraphim of the\nArabs would not have been wholly absurd, or the car of Juggernaut itself\naltogether odious in his eyes. Such is the contrast between the sectary\nand the philosopher.\n\nSECTION III.\n\nAs an instance of the advantage which a philosophical traveller has over\nan unprepared one, look at the difference which will enter into a man's\njudgment of nations, according as he carries about with him the vague\npopular notion of a Moral Sense, or has investigated the laws under\nwhich feelings of right and wrong grow up in all men. It is worth while\nto dwell a little on this important point.\n\nMost persons who take no great pains to think for themselves, have a\nnotion that every human being has feelings, or a conscience, born with\nhim, by which he knows, if he will only attend to it, exactly what is\nright and wrong; and that, as right and wrong are fixed and immutable,\nall ought to agree as to what is sin and virtue in every case. Now,\nmankind are, and always have been, so far from agreeing as to right and\nwrong, that it is necessary to account in some manner for the wide\ndifferences in various ages, and among various nations. A great\ndiversity of doctrines has been put forth for the purpose of lessening\nthe difficulty; but they all leave certain portions of the race under\nthe condemnation or compassion of the rest for their error, blindness,\nor sin. Moreover, no doctrines yet invented have accounted for some\ntotal revolutions in the ideas of right and wrong, which have occurred\nin the course of ages. A person who takes for granted that there is an\nuniversal Moral Sense among men, as unchanging as he who bestowed it,\ncannot reasonably explain how it was that those men were once esteemed\nthe most virtuous who killed the most enemies in battle, while now it is\nconsidered far more noble to save life than to destroy it. They cannot\nbut wonder how it was that it was once thought a great shame to live in\nmisery, and an honour to commit suicide; while now the wisest and best\nmen think exactly the reverse. And, with regard to the present age, it\nmust puzzle men who suppose that all ought to think alike on moral\nsubjects, that there are parts of the world where mothers believe it a\nduty to drown their children, and that eastern potentates openly deride\nthe king of England for having only one wife instead of one hundred.\nThere is no avoiding illiberality, under this belief,--as the\nphilosopher understands illiberality. There is no avoiding the\nconclusion that the people who practice infanticide and polygamy are\ndesperately wicked; and that minor differences of conduct are, abroad as\nat home, so many sins.\n\nThe observer who sets out with a more philosophical belief, not only\nescapes the affliction of seeing sin wherever he sees difference, and\navoids the suffering of contempt and alienation from his species, but,\nby being prepared for what he witnesses, and aware of the causes, is\nfree from the agitation of being shocked and alarmed, preserves his\ncalmness, his hope, his sympathy; and is thus far better fitted to\nperceive, understand, and report upon the morals and manners of the\npeople he visits. His more philosophical belief, derived from all fair\nevidence and just reflexion, is, that every man's feelings of right and\nwrong, instead of being born with him, grow up in him from the\ninfluences to which he is subjected. We see that in other cases,--with\nregard to science, to art, and to the appearances of nature,--feelings\ngrow out of knowledge and experience; and there is every evidence that\nit is so with regard to morals. The feelings begin very early; and this\nis the reason why they are supposed to be born with men; but they are\nfew and imperfect in childhood, and, in the case of those who are\nstrongly exercised in morals, they go on enlarging and strengthening and\nrefining through life. See the effect upon the traveller's observations\nof his holding this belief about conscience! Knowing that some\ninfluences act upon the minds of all people in all countries, he looks\neverywhere for certain feelings of right and wrong which are as sure to\nbe in all men's minds as if they were born with them. For instance, to\ntorment another without any reason, real or imaginary, is considered\nwrong all over the world. In the same manner, to make others happy is\nuniversally considered right. At the same time, the traveller is\nprepared to find an infinite variety of differences in smaller matters,\nand is relieved from the necessity of pronouncing each to be a vice in\none party or another. His own moral education having been a more\nelevated and advanced one than that of some of the people he\ncontemplates, he cannot but feel sorrow and disgust at various things\nthat he witnesses; but it is ignorance and barbarism that he mourns, and\nnot vice. When he sees the Arab or American Indian offer daughter or\nwife to the stranger, as a part of the hospitality which is, in the\nhost's mind, the first of duties, the observer regards the fact as he\nregards the mode of education in old Sparta, where physical hardihood\nand moral slavery constituted a man most honourable. If he sees an\nAmerican student spend the whole of his small fortune, on leaving\ncollege, in travelling in Europe, he will not blame him as he would\nblame a young Englishman for doing the same thing. The Englishman would\nbe a spendthrift; the American is wise: and the reason is, that their\ncircumstances, prospects, and therefore their views of duty, are\ndifferent. The American, being sure of obtaining an independent\nmaintenance, may make the enlargement of his mind, and the cultivation\nof his tastes by travel, his first object; while the conscientious\nEnglishman must fulfil the hard conditions of independence before he can\ntravel. Capital is to him one of the chief requisites of honest\nindependence; while to the American it is in the outset no requisite at\nall. To go without clothing was, till lately, perfectly innocent in the\nSouth Sea Islands; but now that civilization has been fairly established\nby the missionaries, it has become a sin. To let an enemy escape with\nhis life is a disgrace in some countries of the world; while in others\nit is held more honourable to forgive than to punish him. Instances of\nsuch varieties and oppositions of conscience might be multiplied till\nthey filled a volume, to the perplexity and grief of the\nunphilosophical, and the serene instruction of the philosophical\nobserver.\n\nThe general influences under which universal ideas and feelings of right\nand wrong are formed, are dispensed by the Providence under which all\nare educated. That man should be happy is so evidently the intention of\nhis Creator, the contrivances to that end are so multitudinous and so\nstriking, that the perception of the aim may be called universal.\nWhatever tends to make men happy, becomes a fulfilment of the will of\nGod. Whatever tends to make them miserable, becomes opposition to his\nwill. There are, and must be, a host of obstacles to the express\nrecognition of, and practical obedience to, these great principles; but\nthey may be discovered as the root of religion and morals in all\ncountries. There are impediments from ignorance, and consequent error,\nselfishness, and passion: the most infantile men mistake the means of\nhuman happiness, and the wisest have but a dim and fluctuating\nperception of them: but yet all men entertain one common conviction,\nthat what makes people happy is good and right, and that what makes them\nmiserable is evil and wrong. This conviction is at the bottom of\npractices which seem the most inconsistent with it. When the Ashantee\noffers a human sacrifice, it is in order to secure blessings from his\ngods. When the Hindoo exposes his sick parent in the Ganges, he thinks\nhe is putting him out of pain by a charmed death. When Sand stabbed\nKotzebue, he believed he was punishing and getting rid of an enemy and\nan obstacle to the welfare of his nation. When the Georgian planter\nbuys and sells slaves, he goes on the supposition that he is preserving\nthe order and due subordination of society. All these notions are shown\nby philosophy to be narrow, superficial, and mistaken. They have been\noutgrown by many, and are doubtless destined to be outgrown by all; but,\nacted upon by the ignorant and deluded, they are very different from the\nwickedness which is perpetrated against better knowledge. But these\nthings would be wickedness, perpetrated against better knowledge, if the\nsupposition of a universal, infallible Moral Sense were true. The\ntraveller who should consistently adhere to the notion of a Moral Sense,\nmust pronounce the Ashantee worshipper as guilty as Greenacre: the\nHindoo son a parricide, not only in fact, but in the most revolting\nsense of the term: Sand, a Thurtell: and the Georgian planter such a\nmonster of tyranny as a Sussex farmer would be if he set up a\nwhipping-post for his labourers, and sold their little ones to gipsies.\nSuch judgments would be cruelly illiberal. The traveller who is\nfurnished with the more accurate philosophy of Conscience would arrive\nat conclusions, not only more correct, but far less painful; and,\nwithout any laxity of principle, far more charitable.\n\nSo much for one instance of the advantage to the traveller of being\nprovided with definite principles, to be used as a rallying point and\ntest of his observations, instead of mere vague moral notions and\ngeneral prepossessions, which can serve only as a false medium, by which\nmuch that he sees must necessarily be perverted or obscured.\n\nSECTION IV.\n\nThe traveller having satisfied himself that there are some universal\nfeelings about right and wrong, and that in consequence some parts of\nhuman conduct are guided by general rules, must next give his attention\nto modes of conduct, which seem to him good or bad, prevalent in a\nnation, or district, or society of smaller limits. His first general\nprinciple is, that the law of nature is the only one by which mankind at\nlarge can be judged. His second must be, that every prevalent virtue or\nvice is the result of the particular circumstances amidst which the\nsociety exists.\n\nThe circumstances in which a prevalent virtue or vice originates, may or\nmay not be traceable by a traveller. If traceable, he should spare no\npains to make himself acquainted with the whole case. If obscure, he\nmust beware of imputing disgraces to individuals, as if those\nindividuals were living under the influences which have made himself\nwhat he is. He will not blame a deficiency of moral independence in a\ncitizen of Philadelphia so severely as in a citizen of London; seeing,\nas he must do, that the want of moral independence is a prevalent fault\nin the United States, and that there must be some reason for it. Again,\nhe will not look to the Polish peasant for the political intelligence,\nactivity, and principle which delight him in the log-house of the\nAmerican farmer. He sees that Polish peasants are generally supine, and\nAmerican farmers usually interested about politics; and that there must\nbe reasons for the difference.\n\nIn a majority of cases such reasons are, to a great extent,\nascertainable. In Spain, for instance, there is a large class of\nwretched and irretrievable beggars; and their idleness, dirt, and lying\ntrouble the very soul of the traveller. What is the reason of the\nprevalence of this degraded class and of its vices? A Court Lady[C]\nwrote, in ancient days, piteous complaints of the poverty of the\nsovereign, the nobility, the army, and the destitute ladies who waited\nupon the queen. The sovereign could not give his attendants their\ndinners; the nobility melted down their plate and sold their jewels; the\nsoldiers were famishing in garrison, so that the young deserted, and the\naged and invalids wasted away, actually starved to death. The lady\nmentions with surprise, that a particularly large amount of gold and\nsilver had arrived from the foreign possessions of Spain that year, and\ntries to account for the universal misery by saying that a great\nproportion of these riches was appropriated by merchants who supplied\nthe Spaniards with the necessaries of life from abroad; and she speaks\nof this as an evil. She is an example of an unphilosophical\nobserver,--one who could not be trusted to report--much less to account\nfor--the morals and manners of the people before her eyes. What says a\nphilosophical observer?[D] \"Spain and Portugal, the countries which\npossess the mines, are, after Poland, perhaps the two most beggarly\ncountries in Europe.\"--\"Their trade to their colonies is carried on in\ntheir own ships, and is much greater\" (than their foreign commerce,) \"on\naccount of the great riches and extent of those colonies. But it has\nnever introduced any considerable manufactures for distant sale into\neither of those countries, and the greater part of both remains\nuncultivated.\"--\"The proportion of gold and silver to the annual produce\nof the land and labour of Spain is said to be very considerable, and\nthat you frequently find there a profusion of plate in houses where\nthere is nothing else which would in other countries be thought suitable\nor correspondent to this sort of magnificence. The cheapness of gold and\nsilver, or, what is the same thing, the dearness of all commodities,\nwhich is the necessary effect of this redundance of the precious metals,\ndiscourages both the agriculture and manufactures of Spain and Portugal,\nand enables foreign nations to supply them with many sorts of rude, and\nwith almost all sorts of manufactured produce, for a smaller quantity of\ngold and silver than what they themselves can either raise or make them\nfor at home.\"--When it is considered that in Spain gold and silver are\ncalled wealth, and that there is little other; that manufactures and\ncommerce scarcely exist; that agriculture is discouraged, and that\ntherefore there is a lack of occupation for the lower classes, it may be\nfairly concluded that the idle upper orders will be found lazy, proud,\nand poor; the idle lower classes in a state of beggary; and that the\nmost virtuous and happy part of the population will be those who are\nengaged in tilling the soil, and in the occupations which are absolutely\nnecessary in towns. One may see with the mind's eye the groups of\nintriguing grandees, who have no business on their estates to occupy\ntheir time and thoughts; or the crowd of hungry beggars, thronging round\nthe door of a convent, to receive the daily alms; or the hospitable and\ncourteous peasants, of whom a traveller[E] says, \"There is a civility to\nstrangers, and an easy style of behaviour familiar to this class of\nSpanish society, which is very remote from the churlish and awkward\nmanners of the English and German peasantry. Their sobriety and\nendurance of fatigue are very remarkable; and there is a constant\ncheerfulness in their demeanour which strongly prepossesses a stranger\nin their favour.\"--\"I should be glad if I could, with justice, give as\nfavourable a picture of the higher orders of society in this country;\nbut, perhaps, when we consider their wretched education, and their early\nhabits of indolence and dissipation, we ought not to wonder at the state\nof contempt and degradation to which they are reduced. I am not speaking\nthe language of prejudice, but the result of the observations I have\nmade, in which every accurate observer among our countrymen has\nconcurred with me, in saying that the figures and countenances of the\nhigher orders are as much inferior to those of the peasants, as their\nmoral qualities are in the view I have given of them.\"--All this might\nbe foreseen to be unavoidable in a country where the means of living are\npassively derived from abroad, and where the honour and rewards of\nsuccessful industry are confined to a class of the community. The mines\nshould bear the blame of the prevalent faults of the saucy beggars and\nbeggarly grandees of Spain.\n\nTo any one who has at all considered at home the bearings of a social\nsystem which is grounded upon physical force, or those of the opposite\narrangements which rely upon moral power, it can be no mystery abroad\nthat there should be prevalent moral characteristics among the subjects\nof such systems; and the vices which exist under them will be, however\nmourned, leniently judged. Take the Feudal System as an instance, first,\nand then its opposite. A little thought makes it clear what virtues and\nvices will be almost certain to subsist under the influences of each.\n\nThe baron lives in his castle, on a rock or some other eminence, whence\nhe can overlook his domains, or where his ancestor reared his abode for\npurposes of safety. During this stage of society there is little\ndomestic refinement and comfort. The furniture is coarse; the library is\nnot tempting; and the luxurious ease of cities is out of the question.\nThe pleasures of the owner lie abroad. There he devotes himself to rough\nsports, and enjoys his darling luxury,--the exercise of power. Within\nthe dwelling the wife and her attendants spend their lives in\nhandiworks, in playing with the children and keeping them in order, in\nendless conversation on the few events which come under their notice,\nand in obedience to and companionship with the priest. While the master\nis hunting, or gathering together his retainers for the feast, the women\nare spinning or sewing, gossiping, confessing, or doing penance; while\nthe priest studies in his apartment, shares in the mirth, or soothes the\ntroubles of the household, and rules the mind of the noble by securing\nthe confidence of his wife. Out of doors, there are the retainers, by\nwhatever name they may be called. Their poor dwellings are crowded round\nthe castle of the lord; their patches of arable land lie nearest, and\nthe pastures beyond; that, at least, the supply of human food may be\nsecured from any enemy. These portions of land are held on a tenure of\nservice; and, as the retainers have no property in them, and no interest\nin their improvement, and are, moreover, liable to be called away from\ntheir tillage at any moment, to perform military or other service, the\nsoil yields sorry harvests, and the lean cattle are not very ornamental\nto the pastures. The wives of the peasantry are often left, at an hour's\nwarning, in the unprotected charge of their half-clothed and untaught\nchildren, as well as of the cattle and the field.--The festivals of the\npeople are on holy days, and on the return of the chief from war, or\nfrom a pre-eminent chase.\n\nNow, what must be the morals of such a district as this? and, it may be\nadded, of the whole country of which it forms a part? for, if there be\none feudal settlement of the kind, there must be more; and the society\nis in fact made up of a certain number of complete sets of persons,--of\nestablishments like this.--There is no need to go back some centuries\nfor an original to the picture: it exists in more than one country in\nEurope now.\n\nThis kind of society is composed of two classes only; those who have\nsomething, and those who have nothing. The chief has property, some\nknowledge, and great power. With individual differences, the chiefs may\nbe expected to be imperious, from their liberty and indulgence of will;\nbrave, from their exposure to toil and danger; contemptuous of men, from\ntheir own supremacy; superstitious, from the influence of the priest in\nthe household; lavish, from the permanency of their property; vain of\nrank and personal distinction, from the absence of pursuits unconnected\nwith self; and hospitable, partly from the same cause, and partly from\ntheir own hospitality being the only means of gratifying their social\ndispositions.\n\nThe clergy will be politic, subservient, studious, or indolent,\nkind-hearted, effeminate, with a strong tendency to spiritual pride, and\nlove of spiritual dominion. It will be surprising, too, if they are not\ndriven into infidelity by the credulity of their pupils.\n\nThe women will be ignorant and superstitious, for want of varied\ninstruction; brave, from the frequent presence or promise of danger;\nefficient, from the small division of labour which is practicable in the\nsuperintendence of such a family; given to gossip and uncertainty of\ntemper, from the sameness of their lives; devoted to their husbands and\nchildren, from the absence of all other important objects; and vain of\nsuch accomplishments as they have, from an ignorance of what remains to\nbe achieved.\n\nThe retainers must be ignorant,--physically strong and imposing,\nperhaps, but infants in mind, and slaves in morals. Their worship is\nidolatry--of their chief. The virtues permitted to them are fidelity,\nindustry, domestic attachment, and sobriety. It is difficult to see what\nothers are possible. Their faults are all comprehended in the word\nbarbarism.\n\nThese characteristics may be extended to the divisions of the nation\ncorresponding to those of the household: for the sovereign is only a\nhigher feudal chief: his nobles are a more exalted sort of serfs; and\nthose who are masters at home become slaves at court. Under this system,\nwho would be so hardy as to treat brutality in a serf, cunning in a\npriest, prejudice in a lady, and imperiousness in a lord, as any thing\nbut the results--inevitable as mournful--of the state of society?\n\nFeudalism is founded upon physical force, and therefore bears a relation\nto the past alone. Right begins in might, and all the social relations\nof men have originated in physical superiority. The most prevalent ideas\nof the feudal period arise out of the past; what has been longest\nhonoured is held most honourable; and the understanding of men,\nunexercised by learning, and undisciplined by society and political\naction, falls back upon precedent, and reposes there. The tastes, and\neven the passions, of the feudal period bear a relation to antiquity.\nAmbition, prospective as it is in its very nature, has, in this case, a\nstrong retrospective character. The glory that the descendant derives\nfrom his fathers, he burns to transmit. The past is everything: the\nfuture, except in as far as it may resemble the past, is nothing.\n\nSuch, with modifications, have been the prevalent ideas, tastes, and\npassions of the civilized world, till lately. The opposite state of\nsociety, which has begun to be realized, occasions prevalent ideas, and\ntherefore prevalent virtues and vices, of an opposite character.\n\nAs commerce enlarges, as other professions besides the clerical arise,\nas trades become profitable, as cities swell in importance, as\ncommunication improves, raising villages into towns, and hamlets into\nvillages, and the affairs of central communities become spread through\nthe circumference, the lower classes rise, the chiefs lose much of their\nimportance, the value of men for their intrinsic qualifications is\ndiscovered, and such men take the lead in managing the affairs of\nassociated citizens. Instead of all being done by orders issued from a\ncentral power,--commands carrying forth an imperious will, and bringing\nback undoubting obedience,--social affairs begin to be managed by the\nheads and hands of the parties immediately interested. Self-government\nin municipal affairs takes place; and, having taken place in any one set\nof circumstances, it appears likely to be employed within a wider and a\nwider range, till all the government of the community is of that\ncharacter. The United States are the most remarkable examples now before\nthe world of the reverse of the feudal system,--its principles, its\nmethods, its virtues and vices. In as far as the Americans revert, in\nideas and tastes, to the past, this may be attributed to the transition\nbeing not yet perfected,--to the generation which organized the republic\nhaving been educated amidst the remains of feudalism. There are still\nAmericans who boast of ancestors high in the order of birth rather than\nof merit; who in talking of rank have ideas of birth in their minds, and\nwhose tastes lie in the past. But such will be the case while the\nliterature of the world breathes the spirit of former ages, and softens\nthe transition to an opposite social state. A new literature, new modes\nof thought, are daily arising, which point more and more towards the\nfuture. We have already records of the immediate state of the minds and\nfortunes of men and of communities, and not a few speculations which\nstretch far forward into the future. Every year is the admission more\nextensively entered into that moral power is nobler than physical force;\nthere is more earnestness in the conferences of nations, and less\nproneness to war. The highest creations of literature itself, however\nlong ago produced, are now discovered to bear as close a relation to the\nfuture as the past. They are for all time, through all its changes.\nWhile pillars of light in the dim regions of antiquity, they pass over\nin the dawn, and are still before us, casting their shadows to our feet\nas guides into the dazzling future. Pre-eminent among them is the Book\nwhich never had any retrospective character in it. It never sanctioned\nphysical force, pride of ancestry, of valour, of influence, or any other\npride. It never sanctioned arbitrary division of ranks. It never lauded\nthe virtues of feudalism in their disconnection with other virtues; it\nnever spared the faults of feudalism, on the ground of their being the\nnecessary product of feudal circumstances; neither does it now laud and\ntolerate the virtues and vices developed by democracy. This guide has\nnever yet taken up its rest. It is in advance of all existing\ndemocracies, as it ever was of all despotisms. The fact is, that, while\nall manifestations of eminent intellectual and moral force have an\nimperishable quality, this supreme book has not only an immortal\nfreshness, but bears no relation to time:--to it \"one day is as a\nthousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\"\n\nWhat are the prevalent virtues and faults which are to be looked for in\nthe future,--or in those countries which represent somewhat of the\nfuture, as others afford a weakened image of the past? What allowance is\nthe traveller in America to make? Almost precisely the reverse of what\nhe would make in Russia.\n\nIn-door luxury has succeeded to out-door sports: the mechanical arts\nflourish from the elevation of the lower classes, and prowess is gone\nout of fashion. The consequence of this is that the traveller sees\nostentation of personal luxury instead of retinue. In the course of\ntransition to the time when merit will constitute the highest claim to\nrank, wealth succeeds to birth: but even already, the claims of wealth\ngive way before those of intellect. The popular author has more\nobservance than the millionaire in the United States. This is\nhonourable, and yields promise of a still better graduation of ranks.\nWhere moral force is recognized as the moving power of society, it seems\nto follow that the condition of Woman must be elevated; that new\npursuits will be opened to her, and a wider and stronger discipline be\nafforded to her powers. It is not so in America; but this is owing to\nthe interference of other circumstances with the full operation of\ndemocratic principles. The absence of an aristocratic or a sovereign\nwill impels men to find some other will on which to repose their\nindividual weakness, and with which to employ their human veneration.\nThe will of the majority becomes their refuge and unwritten law. The few\nfree-minded resist this will, when it is in opposition to their own, and\nthe slavish many submit. This is accordingly found to be the most\nconspicuous fault of the Americans. Their cautious subservience to\npublic opinion,--their deficiency of moral independence,--is the crying\nsin of their society. Again, the social equality by which the whole of\nlife is laid open to all in a democratic republic, in which every man\nwho has power in him may attain all to which that power is a requisite,\ncannot but enhance the importance of each in the eyes of all; and the\nconsequence is a mutual respect and deference, and also a mutual\nhelpfulness, which are in themselves virtues of a high order, and\npreparatives for others. In these the Americans are exercised and\naccomplished to a degree never generally attained in any other country.\nThis class of virtues constitutes their distinguishing honour, their\ncrowning grace in the company of nations.--Activity and ingenuity are a\nmatter of course where every man's lot is in his own hands.\nUnostentatious hospitality and charity might, in some democracies, be\nlikely to languish; but the Americans have the wealth of a young\ncountry, and the warmth of a young national existence, as stimulus and\nwarrant for pecuniary liberality of every kind.--Popular vanity, and the\nsubservience of political representatives, are the chief dangers which\nremain to be alluded to; and there will probably be no republic for ages\nwhere these will not be found in the form of prevalent vices.--If, under\na feudal system, there is a wholesome exercise of reverence in the\nworship of ancestry, there is, under the opposite system, a no less\nsalutary and perpetual impulse to generosity in the care for posterity.\nThe one has been, doubtless, a benignant influence, tempering the\nruggedness and violence of despotism; the other will prove an elevating\nforce, lifting men above the personal selfishness and mutual\nsubservience which are the besetting perils of equals who unite to\ngovern by their common will.\n\nWhatever may be his philosophy of individual character, the reflective\nobserver cannot travel, with his mind awake, without admitting that\nthere can be no question but that national character is formed, or\nlargely influenced, by the gigantic circumstances which, being the\nproduct of no individual mind, are directly attributable to the great\nMoral Governor of the human race. Every successive act of research or\ntravel will impress him more and more deeply with this truth, which, for\nthe sake of his own peace and liberality, it would be well that he\nshould carry about with him from the outset. He will not visit\nindividuals with any bitterness of censure for participating in\nprevalent faults. He will regard social virtues and graces as shedding\nhonour on all whom they overshadow, from the loftiest to the lowliest;\nwhile he is not disposed to indulge contempt, or anything but a mild\ncompassion, for any social depravity or deformity which, being the clear\nresult of circumstances, and itself a circumstance, may be considered as\nsurely destined to be remedied, as the wisdom of associated, like that\nof individual man, grows with his growth, and strengthens with his\nstrength.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nMORAL REQUISITES.\n\n \"I respect knowledge; but I do not despise ignorance. They think\n only as their fathers thought, worship as they worshipped. They\n do no more.\"--ROGERS.\n\n \"He was alive\n To all that was enjoyed where'er he went,\n And all that was endured.\" WORDSWORTH.\n\nThe traveller, being furnished with the philosophical requisites for the\nobservation of morals and manners,\n\n1stly. With a certainty of what it is that he wants to know,--\n\n2ndly. With principles which may serve as a rallying point and test of\nhis observations,--\n\n3rdly. With, for instance, a philosophical and definite, instead of a\npopular and vague, notion about the origin of human feelings of right\nand wrong,--\n\n4thly. And with a settled conviction that prevalent virtues and vices\nare the result of gigantic general influences,--is yet not fitted for\nhis object if certain moral requisites be wanting in him.\n\nAn observer, to be perfectly accurate, should be himself perfect. Every\nprejudice, every moral perversion, dims or distorts whatever the eye\nlooks upon. But as we do not wait to be perfect before we travel, we\nmust content ourselves with discovering, in order to avoidance, what\nwould make our task hopeless, and how we may put ourselves in a state to\nlearn at least something truly. We cannot suddenly make ourselves a\ngreat deal better than we have been, for such an object as observing\nMorals and Manners; but, by clearly ascertaining what it is that the\nmost commonly, or the most grossly, vitiates foreign observation, we may\nput a check upon our spirit of prejudice, and carry with us restoratives\nof temper and spirits which may be of essential service to us in our\ntask.\n\nThe observer must have sympathy; and his sympathy must be untrammelled\nand unreserved. If a traveller be a geological inquirer, he may have a\nheart as hard as the rocks he shivers, and yet succeed in his immediate\nobjects: if he be a student of the fine arts, he may be as silent as a\npicture, and yet gain his ends: if he be a statistical investigator, he\nmay be as abstract as a column of figures, and yet learn what he wants\nto know: but an observer of morals and manners will be liable to\ndeception at every turn, if he does not find his way to hearts and\nminds. Nothing was ever more true than that \"as face answers to face in\nwater, so is the heart of man.\" To the traveller there are two meanings\nin this wise saying, both worthy of his best attention. It means that\nthe action of the heart will meet a corresponding action, and that the\nnature of the heart will meet a corresponding nature. Openness and\nwarmth of heart will be greeted with openness and warmth:--this is one\ntruth. Hearts, generous or selfish, pure or gross, gay or sad, will\nunderstand, and therefore be likely to report of, only their like:--this\nis another truth.\n\nThere is the same human heart everywhere,--the universal growth of mind\nand life,--ready to open to the sunshine of sympathy, flourishing in the\nenclosures of cities, and blossoming wherever dropped in the wilderness;\nbut folding up when touched by chill, and drooping in gloom. As well\nmight the Erl-king go and play the florist in the groves and plains of\nthe tropics, as an unsympathizing man render an account of society. It\nwill all turn to stubble and sapless rigidity before his eyes.\n\nThere is the same human heart everywhere; and, if the traveller has a\ngood one himself, he will presently find this out, whatever may have\nbeen his fears at home of checks to his sympathy from difference of\neducation, objects in life, &c. There is no place where people do not\nsuffer and enjoy; where love is not the high festival of life; where\nbirth and death are not occasions of emotion; where parents are not\nproud of their boy-children; where thoughtful minds do not speculate\nupon the two eternities; where, in short, there is not broad ground on\nwhich any two human beings may meet and clasp hands, if they have but\nunsophisticated hearts. If a man have not sympathy, there is no point of\nthe universe--none so wide even as the Mahomedan bridge over the\nbottomless pit--where he can meet with his fellow. Such an one is indeed\nfloundering in the bottomless pit, with only the shadows of men ever\nflitting about him.\n\nI have mentioned elsewhere, what will well bear repetition,--that an\nAmerican merchant, who had made several voyages to China, dropped a\nremark by his own fire-side on the narrowness which causes us to\nconclude, avowedly or silently, that, however well men may use the\nlight they have, they cannot be more than nominally our brethren, unless\nthey have our religion, our philosophy, and our methods of attaining\nboth. He said he often recurred, with delight, to the conversations he\nhad enjoyed with his Chinese friends on some of the highest speculative,\nand some of the deepest and widest practical subjects, which his\nfellow-citizens of New England were apt to think could be the business\nonly of Protestant Christians. This American merchant's observations on\noriental morals and manners had an incalculable weight after he had said\nthis; for it was known that he had seen into hearts, as well as met\nfaces, and discovered what people's minds were busy about, as their\nhands were pursuing the universal employment of earning their\nsubsistence.\n\nUnless a traveller interprets by his sympathies what he sees, he cannot\nbut misunderstand the greater part of that which comes under his\nobservation. He will not be admitted with freedom into the retirements\nof domestic life; the instructive commentary on all the facts of\nlife,--discourse,--will be of a slight and superficial character. People\nwill talk to him of the things they care least about, instead of seeking\nhis sympathy about the affairs which are deepest in their hearts. He\nwill be amused with public spectacles, and informed of historical and\nchronological facts; but he will not be invited to weddings and\nchristenings; he will hear no love-tales; domestic sorrows will be kept\nas secrets from him; the old folks will not pour out their stories to\nhim, nor the children bring him their prattle. Such a traveller will be\nno more fitted to report on morals and manners than he would be to give\nan account of the silver mines of Siberia by walking over the surface,\nand seeing the entrance and the product.\n\n\"Human conduct,\" says a philosopher, \"is guided by rules.\" Without these\nrules, men could not live together, and they are also necessary to the\nrepose of individual minds. Robinson Crusoe could not have endured his\nlife for a month without rules to live by. A life without purpose is\nuncomfortable enough; but a life without rules would be a wretchedness\nwhich, happily, man is not constituted to bear. The rules by which men\nlive are chiefly drawn from the universal convictions about right and\nwrong which I have mentioned as being formed everywhere, under strong\ngeneral influences. When sentiment is connected with these rules, they\nbecome religion; and this religion is the animating spirit of all that\nis said and done. If the stranger cannot sympathize in the sentiment, he\ncannot understand the religion; and without understanding the religion,\nhe cannot appreciate the spirit of words and acts. A stranger who has\nnever felt any strong political interest, and cannot sympathize with\nAmerican sentiment about the majesty of social equality, and the beauty\nof mutual government, can never understand the political religion of the\nUnited States; and the sayings of the citizens by their own fire-sides,\nthe perorations of orators in town-halls, the installations of public\nservants, and the process of election, will all be empty sound and\ngrimace to him. He will be tempted to laugh,--to call the world about\nhim mad,--like one who, without hearing the music, sees a room-full of\npeople begin to dance. The case is the same with certain Americans who\nhave no antiquarian sympathies, and who think our sovereigns mad for\nriding to St. Stephen's in the royal state-coach, with eight horses\ncovered with trappings, and a tribe of grotesque footmen. I have found\nit an effort of condescension to inform such observers that we should\nnot think of inventing such a coach and appurtenances at the present\nday, any more than we should the dress of the Christ-Hospital boys. If\nan unsympathizing stranger is so perplexed by a mere matter of external\narrangement,--a royal procession, or a popular election,--what can he be\nexpected to make of that which is far more important, more intricate,\nmore mysterious,--neighbourly and domestic life? If he knows and feels\nnothing of the religion of these, he could learn but little about them,\neven if the roofs of all the houses of a city were made transparent to\nhim, and he could watch all that is done in every parlour, kitchen, and\nnursery in a circuit of five miles.\n\nWhat strange scenes and transactions must such an one think that there\nare in the world! What would he have thought of the spectacle one day\nseen in Hayti, when Toussaint L'Ouverture ranged his negro forces before\nhim, called out thirteen men from the ranks by name, and ordered them to\nrepair to a certain spot to be immediately shot? What would he have\nthought of these thirteen men for crossing their arms upon their\nbreasts, bowing their heads submissively, and yielding instant\nobedience? He might have pronounced Toussaint a ferocious despot, and\nthe thirteen so many craven fools: while the facts wear a very different\naspect to one who knows the minds of the men. It was necessary to the\ngood-will of a society but lately organized out of chaos, to make no\ndistinction between negro and other insurgents; and these thirteen men\nwere ringleaders in a revolt, Toussaint's nephew being one of them.\nThis accounts for the general's share in the transaction. As for the\nnegroes, the General was also the Deliverer,--an object of worship to\npeople of his colour. Obedience to him was a rule, exalted by every\nsentiment of gratitude, awe, admiration, pride, and love, into a\nreligion; and a Haytian of that day would no more have thought of\nresisting a command of Toussaint, than of disputing a thunder-stroke or\nan earthquake.--What would an unsympathizing observer make of the\nPaschal supper, as celebrated in the houses of Hebrews throughout the\nworld,--of the care not to break a bone of the lamb,--of the company all\nstanding, the men girded and shod as for a journey, and the youngest\nchild of the household invariably asking what this is all for? What\nwould the observer call it but mummery, if he had no feeling for the\nawful traditional and religious emotion involved in the symbol?--What\nwould such an one think of the terrified flight of two Spanish nobles\nfrom the wrath of their sovereign, incurred by their having saved his\nbeloved queen from being killed by a fall from her horse? What a puzzle\nis here,--even when all the facts of the case are known;--that the king\nwas looking from a balcony to see his queen mount her Andalusian horse:\nthat the horse reared, plunged, and bolted, throwing the queen, whose\nfoot was entangled in the stirrup: that she was surrounded with\ngentlemen who stood aloof, because by the law of Spain it was death to\nany but her little pages to touch the person, and especially the foot of\nthe queen, and her pages were too young to rescue her; that these two\ngentlemen devoted themselves to save her; and having caught the horse,\nand extricated the royal foot, fled for their lives from the legal\nwrath of the king! Whence such a law? From the rule that the queen of\nSpain has no legs. Whence such a rule? From the meaning that the queen\nof Spain is a being too lofty to touch the earth. Here we come at last\nto the sentiment of loyal admiration and veneration which sanctifies the\nlaw and the rule, and interprets the incident. To a heartless stranger\nthe whole appears a mere solemn absurdity, fit only to be set aside, as\nit was apparently by pardon from the king being obtained by the instant\nintercession of the queen. But in the eyes of every Spaniard the\ntransaction was, in all its parts, as far from absurdity as the danger\nof the two nobles was real and pressing.--Again, what can a heartless\nobserver understand by the practice, almost universal in the world, of\ncelebrating the naming of children? The Christian parent employs a form\nby which the infant is admitted as a lamb of Christ's flock: the Chinese\nfather calls his kindred together to witness the conferring first of the\nsurname, and then of \"the milk-name,\"--some endearing diminutive, to\ncease with infancy: the Moslem consults an astrologer before giving a\nname to his child: and the savage selects a name-sake for his infant\nfrom among the beasts or birds, with whose characteristic quality he\nwould fain endow his offspring. What a general rule is here, exalted by\na universal sentiment into an act of religion! The ceremonial observed\nin each case is widely different in its aspect to one who sees in it\nmerely a cumbrous way of transacting a matter of convenience, and to\nanother who perceives in it the initiation of a new member into the\nfamily of mankind, and a looking forward to,--an attempt to make\nprovision for, the future destiny of an unconscious and helpless being.\n\nThus it will be through the whole range of the traveller's observation.\nIf he be full of sympathy, every thing he sees will be instructive, and\nthe most important matters will be the most clearly revealed. If he be\nunsympathizing, the most important things will be hidden from him, and\nsymbols (in which every society abounds) will be only absurd or trivial\nforms. The stranger will be wise to conclude, when he sees anything\nseriously done which appears to him insignificant or ludicrous, that\nthere is more in it than he perceives, from some deficiency of knowledge\nor feeling of his own.\n\nThe other way in which heart is found to answer to heart is too obvious\nto require to be long dwelt upon. Men not only see according to the\nlight they shed from their own breasts,--whether it be the sunshine of\ngenerosity or the hell-flames of bad passions,--but they attract to\nthemselves spirits like their own. The very same persons appear very\ndifferently to a traveller who calls into exercise all their best\nqualities, and to one who has an affinity with their worst: but it is a\nyet more important consideration that actually different elements of\nsociety will range themselves round the observer according to the\nscepticism or faith of his temper, the purity or depravity of his\ntastes, and the elevation or insignificance of his objects. The\nAmericans, somewhat nettled with the injustice of English travellers'\nreports of their country, have jokingly proposed to take lodgings in\nWapping for some thorough-bred American vixen, of low tastes and coarse\nmanners, and employ her to write an account of English morals and\nmanners from what she might see in a year's abode in the choice locality\nselected for her. This would be no great exaggeration of the process of\nobservation of foreigners which is perpetually going on.\n\nWhat should gamesters know of the philanthropists of the society they\npass through? or the profligate, of the real state of domestic life?\nWhat can the moral sceptic report of religious or philosophical\nconfessorship in any nation? or the sordid trader, of the higher kinds\nof intellectual cultivation? or the dandy, of the extent and\nadministration of charity? It may be said that neither can the\nphilanthropic traveller--the missionary--see otherwise than partially\nfor want of \"knowledge of the world;\" that persons of sober habits can\nlearn nothing that is going on in the moral depths of society; and the\ngood are actually scoffed at for their absence from many scenes of human\nlife, and their supposed ignorance of many things in human nature. But\nit is certain that the best part of every man's mind is far more a\nspecimen of himself than the worst; and that the characteristics of a\nsociety, in like manner, are to be traced in the wisest and most genial\nof its pervading ideas and common transactions, instead of those\ndisgraceful ones which are common to all. Swindlers, drunkards, people\nof low tastes and bad passions, are found in every country, and nowhere\ncharacterise a nation; while the reverence of man in America, the\npursuit of speculative truth in Germany, philanthropic enterprise in\nFrance, love of freedom in Switzerland, popular education in China,\ndomestic purity in Norway,--each of these great moral beauties is a star\non the forehead of a nation. Goodness and simplicity are indissolubly\nunited. The bad are the most sophisticated, all the world over; and the\ngood the least. It may be taken as a rule that the best qualities of a\npeople, as of an individual, are the most characteristic--(what is\nreally _best_ being tested, not by prejudice, but principle). He has the\nbest chance of ascertaining these best qualities who has them in\nhimself; and he who has them not may as well pretend to give a picture\nof a metropolitan city by showing a map of its drainage, as report of a\nnation after an intercourse with its knaves and its profligates. To\nstand on the highest pinnacle is the best way of obtaining an accurate\ngeneral view, in contemplating a society as well as a city.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nMECHANICAL REQUISITES.\n\n \"He travels and expatiates, as the bee\n From flower to flower, so he from land to land:\n The manners, customs, policy, of all\n Pay contribution to the stores he gleans.\"--_The Task._\n\n \"Thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine, most truly falsely, must\n needs be granted to be much at one.\"--_King Henry V._\n\nNo philosophical or moral fitness will qualify a traveller to observe a\npeople if he does not select a mode of travelling which will enable him\nto see and converse with a great number and variety of persons. An\nambassador has no chance of learning much of the people he visits\nanywhere but in a new country like America. While he is _en route_, he\nis too stately in appearance to allow of any familiarity on the part of\nthe people by the road-side. His carriages might almost as well roll\nthrough a city of the dead, for anything he will learn from intercourse\nwith the living. The case is not much better when a family or a party of\nfriends travel together on the Continent, committing the business of the\nexpedition to servants, and shrinking from intercourse, on all social\noccasions, with English shyness or pride.\n\nThe behaviour of the English on the Continent has become a matter of\nvery serious consequence to the best informed and best mannered of their\ncountrymen, as it has long been to the natives into whose society they\nmay happen to fall. I have heard gentlemen say that they lose half their\npleasure in going abroad, from the coldness and shyness with which the\nEnglish are treated; a coldness and shyness which they think fully\nwarranted by the conduct of their predecessors in travel. I have heard\nladies say that they find great difficulty in becoming acquainted with\ntheir neighbours at the tables-d'hôte; and that, when they have\nsucceeded, an apology for the reluctance to converse has been offered,\nin the form of explanation that English travellers generally \"appear to\ndislike being spoken to\" so much as to render it a matter of civility to\nleave them alone. The travelling arrangements of the English seem\ndesigned to cut them off from companionship with the people they go to\nsee; and they preclude the possibility of studying morals and manners in\na way which is perfectly ludicrous to persons of a more social\ntemperament and habits.\n\nA good deal may be learned on board steam-boats, and in such vehicles as\nthe American stages; and when accommodations of the kind become common,\nit will be difficult for the sulkiest Englishman to avoid admitting some\nideas into his mind from the conversation and actions of the groups\naround him. When steam-boats ply familiarly on the Indus, and we have\nthe rail-road to Calcutta which people are joking about, and another\nacross the Pampas,--when we make trips to New Zealand, and think little\nof a run down the west coast of Africa,--places where we shall go for\nfashion's sake, and cannot go boxed up in a carriage of Long Acre\norigin,--our countrymen will, perforce, exchange conversation with the\npersons they meet, and may chance to get rid of the unsociability for\nwhich they are notorious, and by which they cast a veil over hearts and\nfaces, and a shadow over their own path, wherever they go.\n\nMeantime, the wisest and happiest traveller is the pedestrian. If\ngentlemen and ladies want to see pictures, let them post to Florence,\nand be satisfied with learning what they can from the windows by the\nway. But if they want to see either scenery or people, let all who have\nstrength and courage go on foot. I prefer this even to horseback. A\nhorse is an anxiety and a trouble. Something is sure to ail it; and one\nis more anxious about its accommodation than about one's own. The\npedestrian traveller is wholly free from care. There is no such freeman\non earth as he is for the time. His amount of toil is usually within his\nown choice,--in any civilized region. He can go on and stop when he\nlikes: if a fit of indolence overtakes him, he can linger for a day or a\nweek in any spot that pleases him. He is not whirled past a beautiful\nview almost before he has seen it. He is not tantalized by the idea that\nfrom this or that point he could see something still finer, if he could\nbut reach it. He can reach almost every point his wishes wander to. The\npleasure is indescribable of saying to one's self, \"I will go\nthere,\"--\"I will rest yonder,\"--and forthwith accomplishing it. He can\nsit on a rock in the midst of a rushing stream as often in a day as he\nlikes. He can hunt a waterfall by its sound; a sound which the\ncarriage-wheels prevent other travellers from hearing. He can follow out\nany tempting glade in any wood. There is no cushion of moss at the foot\nof an old tree that he may not sit down on if he pleases. He can read\nfor an hour without fear of passing by something unnoticed while his\neyes are fixed upon his book. His food is welcome, be its quality what\nit may, while he eats it under the alders in some recess of a brook. He\nis secure of his sleep, be his chamber ever so sordid; and when his\nwaking eyes rest upon his knapsack, his heart leaps with pleasure as he\nremembers where he is, and what a day is before him. Even the weather\nseems to be of less consequence to the pedestrian than to other\ntravellers. A pedestrian journey presupposes abundance of time, so that\nthe traveller can rest in villages on rainy days, and in the shade of a\nwood during the hours when the sun is too powerful. And if he prefers\nnot waiting for the rain, it is not the evil to him that it would be in\ncities and in the pursuit of business. The only evil of rain that I know\nof, to healthy persons in exercise, is that it spoils the clothes; and\nthe clothes of a pedestrian traveller are not usually of a spoilable\nquality. Rain does not deform the face of things everywhere as it does\nin a city. It adds a new aspect of beauty occasionally to a wood, to\nmountains, to lake and ocean scenery. I remember a hale, cheerful\npedestrian tourist whom we met frequently among the White Mountains of\nNew Hampshire, and whom we remarked as being always the briskest of the\ncompany at the hotel table in the evening, and the merriest at\nbreakfast. He had the best of it one day, when we passed him in\nFranconia Defile, after a heavy rain had set in. We were packed in a\nwaggon which seemed likely to fill with water before we got to our\ndestination; and miserable enough we looked, drenched and cold. The\ntraveller was marching on over the rocky road, his book safe in its\noil-skin cover, and his clothes-bag similarly protected; his face\nbright and glowing with exercise, and his summer jacket of linen\nfeeling, as he told us, all the pleasanter for being wet through. As he\npassed each recess of the defile, he looked up perpetually to see the\nrain come smoking out of the fissures of the rocks; and when he reached\nthe opening by which he was to descend to the plain, he stood still, to\nwatch the bar of dewy yellow light which lay along the western sky where\nthe sun had just set. He looked just as happy on other days. Sometimes\nwe passed him lying along on a hill side; sometimes talking with a\nfamily at the door of a log-house; sometimes reading as he walked under\nthe shade of the forest. I, for one, often longed to dismiss our waggon\nor barouche, and to follow his example.\n\nOne peculiar advantage of pedestrian travelling is the pleasure of a\ngradual approach to celebrated or beautiful places. Every turn of the\nroad gains in interest; every object that meets the eye seems to have\nsome initiative meaning; and when the object itself at last appears,\nnothing can surpass the delight of flinging one's self on the ground to\nrest upon the first impression, and to interpose a delicious pause\nbefore the final attainment. It is not the same thing to desire your\ndriver to stop when you come to the point of view. The first time that I\nfelt this was on a pedestrian tour in Scotland, when I was at length to\nsee mountains. The imagination of myself and my companion had fixed\nstrongly on Dunkeld, as being a scene of great beauty, and our first\nresting-place among the mountains. The sensation had been growing all\nthe morning. Men, houses, and trees had seemed to be growing\ndiminutive,--an irresistible impression to the novice in mountain\nscenery: the road began to follow the windings of the Tay, a sign that\nthe plain was contracting into a pass. Beside a cistern, on a green bank\nof this pass, we had dined; a tract of heath next lay before us, and we\ntraversed it so freshly and merrily as to be quite unaware that we were\ngetting towards the end of our seventeen miles, though still conscious\nthat the spirit of the mountains was upon us. We were deeply engaged in\ntalk, when a winding of the road brought us in full view of the lovely\nscene which is known to all who have approached Dunkeld by the Perth\nroad. We could scarcely believe that this was _it_, so soon. We turned\nto our map and guide-book, and found that we were standing on the site\nof Birnam wood; that Dunsinane hill was in sight, and that it was indeed\nthe old cathedral tower of Dunkeld that rose so grandly among the\nbeeches behind the bridge. We took such a long and fond gaze as I never\nenjoyed from a carriage window. If it was thus with an object of no more\nimportance or difficulty of attainment than Dunkeld, what must it be to\ncatch the first view of the mysterious temples that\n\n \"Stand between the mountains and the sea;\n Awful memorials, but of whom we know not!\"\n\nor to survey from a height, at sunrise, the brook Kedron and the valley\nof Jehoshaphat!\n\nWhat is most to our present purpose, however, is the consideration of\nthe facilities afforded by pedestrian travelling for obtaining a\nknowledge of the people. We all remember Goldsmith's travels with his\nflute, his sympathies, his cordiality of heart and manner, and his\nreliance on the hospitality of the country people. Such an one as he is\nnot bound to take up with such specimens as he may meet with by the side\nof the high road; he can penetrate into the recesses of the country, and\ndrop into the hamlet among the hills, and the homesteads down the lanes,\nand now and then spend a day with the shepherd in his fold on the downs;\nhe can stop where there is a festival, and solve many a perplexity by\ncarrying over the conversation of one day into the intercourse of the\nnext, with a fresh set of people; he can obtain access to almost every\nclass of persons, and learn their own views of their own affairs. His\nopportunities are inestimable.\n\nIf it were a question which could learn most of Morals and Manners by\ntravel,--the gentleman accomplished in philosophy and learning,\nproceeding in his carriage, with a courier,--or a simple pedestrian\ntourist, furnished only with the language, and with an open heart and\nfrank manners,--I should have no doubt that the pedestrian would return\nmore familiar with his subject than the other. If the wealthy scholar\nand philosopher could make himself a citizen of the world for the time,\nand go forth on foot, careless of luxury, patient of fatigue, and\nfearless of solitude, he would be not only of the highest order of\ntourists, but a benefactor to the highest kind of science; and he would\nbecome familiarized with what few are acquainted with,--the best\npleasures, transient and permanent, of travel. Those who cannot pursue\nthis method will achieve most by laying aside state, conversing with the\npeople they fall in with, and diverging from the high road as much as\npossible.\n\nNothing need be said on a matter so obvious as the necessity of\nunderstanding the language of the people visited. Some familiarity with\nit must be attained before anything else can be done. It seems to be\nunquestioned, however, that a good deal of the unsociability of the\nEnglish abroad is owing not so much to contempt of their neighbours, as\nto the natural pride which makes them shrink from attempting what they\ncannot do well. I am confident that we say much less than we feel about\nthe awkwardness and constraint of our first self-committals to a foreign\nlanguage. It is impossible but that every one must feel the weight of\nthe penalty of making himself ridiculous at every step, and of\npresenting a kind of false appearance of himself to every one with whom\nhe converses. A German gentleman in America, who has exactly that right\ndegree of self-respect which enabled him to set strenuously about\nlearning English, of which he did not understand a word, and who\nmastered it so completely as to lecture in faultless English at the end\nof two years, astonished a party of friends one day, persuaded as they\nwere that they perfectly knew him, and that the smooth and deliberate\nflow of his beautiful language was a consequence of the calmness of his\ntemper, and the philosophical character of his mind. A German woman with\nchildren came begging to the house while the party were at their\ndessert. The professor caught her tones when the door of the dining-room\nwas open; he rushed into the hall, presently returned for a dish or two,\nand emptied the gingerbread, and other material of the dessert, into her\nlap. The company went out to see, and found the professor transformed;\nhe was talking with a rapidity and vehemence which they had never\nsupposed him capable of; and one of the party told me how sorry she\nfelt, and has felt ever since, to think of the state of involuntary\ndisguise in which he is living among those who would know him best.\nDifference of language is undeniably a cause of great suffering and\ndifficulty, magnificent and incalculable as are its uses. It is no\nexception to the general rule that every great good involves some evil.\n\nHappily, however, the difficulty may be presently so far surmounted as\nnot to interfere with the object of observing Morals and Manners.\nImpossible as it may be to attain to an adequate expression of one's\nself in a foreign tongue, it is easy to most persons to learn to\nunderstand it perfectly when spoken by others. During this process, a\ncommon and almost unavoidable mistake is to suppose a too solemn and\nweighty meaning in what is expressed in an unfamiliar language. This\narises partly from our having become first acquainted with the language\nin books; and partly from the meaning having been attained with effort,\nand seeming, by natural association, worth the pains. The first French\ndialogues which a child learns, seem more emphatic in their meanings\nthan the same material would in English; and the student of German finds\na grandeur in lines of Schiller, and in clauses of Herder's and\nKrummacher's Parables, which he looks for in vain when he is practised\nin the language. It is well to bear this in mind on a first entrance\ninto a foreign society, or the traveller may chance to detect himself\ntreasuring up nonsense, and making much of mere trivialities, because\nthey reached him clothed in the mystery of a strange language. He will\nbe like lame Jervas, when he first came up from the mine in which he was\nborn, caressing the weeds he had gathered by the road side, and refusing\ntill the last moment to throw away such wonderful and beautiful things.\nThe raw traveller not only sees something mysterious, picturesque, or\nclassical in every object that meets his eye after passing the frontier,\nfrom the children's toys to palaces and general festivals, but is apt to\ndiscern wisdom and solemnity in everything that is said to him, from the\ngreeting of the landlord to the speculations of the politician. If not\nguarded against, this natural tendency will more or less vitiate the\nobserver's first impressions, and introduce something of the ludicrous\ninto his record of them.\n\nFrom the consideration of the requisites for observation in the\ntraveller himself, we now proceed to indicate what he is to observe, in\norder to inform himself of foreign Morals and Manners.\n\nPART II.\n\nWHAT TO OBSERVE.\n\n \"Nous nous en tiendrons aux moeurs, aux habitudes extérieures\n dont se forme, pour les differentes classes de la société, une\n sorte de physionomie morale, où se retracent les moeurs\n privées.\" DE JOUY.\n\nIt is a perpetual wonder to an inexperienced person that the students of\nparticular classes of facts can learn so much as they do from a single\nbranch of inquiry. Tell an uninformed man of the daily results of the\nstudy of Fossil Remains, and he will ask how the student can possibly\nknow what was done in the world ages before man was created. It will\nastonish a thoughtless man to hear the statements about the condition of\nthe English nation which are warranted by the single study of the\nadministration of the Poor Laws, since their origin. Some physiognomists\nfix their attention on a single feature of the human face, and can\npretty accurately interpret the general character of the mind from it:\nand I believe every portrait painter trusts mainly to one feature for\nthe fidelity of his likenesses, and bestows more study and care on that\none than on any other.\n\nA good many features compose the physiognomy of a nation; and scarcely\nany traveller is qualified to study them all. The same man is rarely\nenlightened enough to make investigation at once into the religion of a\npeople, into its general moral notions, its domestic and economical\nstate, its political condition, and the facts of its progress;--all\nwhich are necessary to a full understanding of its morals and manners.\nFew have even attempted an inquiry of this extent. The worst of it is\nthat few dream of undertaking the study of any one feature of society at\nall. We should by this time have been rich in the knowledge of nations\nif each intelligent traveller had endeavoured to report of any one\ndepartment of moral inquiry, however narrow; but, instead of this, the\nobservations offered to us are almost purely desultory. The traveller\nhears and notes what this and that and the other person says. If three\nor four agree in their statements on any point, he remains unaware of a\ndoubt, and the matter is settled. If they differ, he is perplexed, does\nnot know whom to believe, and decides, probably, in accordance with\nprepossessions of his own. The case is almost equally bad, either way.\nHe will hear only one side of every question if he sees only one class\nof persons,--like the English in America, for instance, who go commonly\nwith letters of introduction from merchants at home to merchants in the\nmaritime cities, and hear nothing but federal politics, and see nothing\nbut aristocratic manners. They come home with notions which they suppose\nto be indisputable about the great Bank question, the state of parties,\nand the relations of the General and State governments; and with words\nin their mouths of whose objectionable character they are\nunaware,--about the common people, mob government, the encroachment of\nthe poor upon the rich, and so on. Such partial intercourse is fatal to\nthe observations of a traveller; but it is less perplexing and painful\nat the time than the better process of going from one set of people to\nanother, and hearing what all have to say. No traveller in the United\nStates can learn much of the country without conversing equally with\nfarmers and merchants, with artizans and statesmen, with villagers and\nplanters; but, while discharging this duty, he will be so bewildered\nwith the contrariety of statements and convictions, that he will often\nshut his note-book in a state of scepticism as to whether there be any\ntruth at all shining steadily behind all this tempest of opinions. Thus\nit is with the stranger who traverses the streets of Warsaw, and is\ntrusted with the groans of some of the outraged mourners who linger in\nits dwellings; and then goes to St. Petersburg, and is presented with\nevidences of the enlightenment of the Czar, of his humanity, his\npaternal affection for his subjects, and his general superiority to his\nage. At Warsaw the traveller called him a miscreant; at Petersburg he is\nrequired to pronounce him a philanthropist. Such must be the uncertainty\nof judgment when it is based upon the testimony of individuals. To\narrive at the facts of the condition of a people through the discourse\nof individuals, is a hopeless enterprise. The plain truth is--it is\nbeginning at the wrong end.\n\nThe grand secret of wise inquiry into Morals and Manners is to begin\nwith the study of THINGS, using the DISCOURSE OF PERSONS as a commentary\nupon them.\n\nThough the facts sought by travellers relate to Persons, they may most\nreadily be learned from Things. The eloquence of Institutions and\nRecords, in which the action of the nation is embodied and perpetuated,\nis more comprehensive and more faithful than that of any variety of\nindividual voices. The voice of a whole people goes up in the silent\nworkings of an institution; the condition of the masses is reflected\nfrom the surface of a record. The Institutions of a nation,--political,\nreligious, or social,--put evidence into the observer's hands as to its\ncapabilities and wants which the study of individuals could not yield in\nthe course of a lifetime. The Records of any society, be they what they\nmay, whether architectural remains, epitaphs, civic registers, national\nmusic, or any other of the thousand manifestations of the common mind\nwhich may be found among every people, afford more information on Morals\nin a day than converse with individuals in a year. Thus also must\nManners be judged of, since there never was a society yet, not even a\nnunnery or a Moravian settlement, which did not include a variety of\nmanners. General indications must be looked for, instead of\ngeneralizations being framed from the manners of individuals. In cities,\ndo social meetings abound? and what are their purposes and character?\nAre they most religious, political, or festive? If religious, have they\nmore the character of Passion Week at Rome, or of a camp-meeting in\nOhio? If political, do the people meet on wide plains to worship the Sun\nof the Celestial Empire, as in China; or in town-halls, to remonstrate\nwith their representatives, as in England; or in secret places, to\nspring mines under the thrones of their rulers, as in Spain? If\nfestive, are they most like an Italian carnival, where everybody laughs;\nor an Egyptian holiday, when all eyes are solemnly fixed on the whirling\nDervishes? Are women there? In what proportions, and under what law of\nliberty? What are the public amusements? There is an intelligible\ndifference between the opera at Milan, and the theatre at Paris, and a\nbull-fight at Madrid, and a fair at Leipzig, and a review at St.\nPetersburg.--In country towns, how is the imitation of the metropolis\ncarried on? Do the provincials emulate most in show, in science, or in\nthe fine arts?--In the villages, what are the popular amusements? Do the\npeople meet to drink or to read, to discuss, or play games, or dance?\nWhat are the public houses like? Do the people eat fruit and tell\nstories? or drink ale and talk politics or call for tea and saunter\nabout? or coffee and play dominoes? or lemonade and laugh at Punch? Do\nthey crowd within four walls, or gather under the elm, or spread\nthemselves abroad over the cricket-field or the yellow sands?--There is\nas wide a difference among the humbler classes of various countries as\namong their superiors in rank. A Scotch burial is wholly unlike the\nceremonies of the funeral pile among the Cingalese; and an interment in\nthe Greek church little resembles either. A conclave of White Boys in\nMayo, assembled in a mud hovel on a heath, to pledge one another to\ntheir dreadful oath, is widely different from a similar conclave of\nSwiss insurgents, met in a pine wood on a steep, on the same kind of\nerrand: and both are as little like as may be to the heroes of the last\nrevolution in Paris, or to the companies of Covenanters that were wont\nto meet, under a similar pressure of circumstances, in the defiles of\nthe Scottish mountains.--In the manners of all classes, from the highest\nto the lowest, are forms of manners enforced in action, or dismissed in\nwords? Is there barbarous freedom in the lower, while there is formality\nin the higher ranks, as in newly settled countries? or have all grown up\ntogether to that period of refined civilization when ease has superseded\nalike the freedom of the Australian peasantry, and the etiquette of the\ncourt of Ava?--What are the manners of professional men of the society,\nfrom the eminent lawyer or physician of the metropolis down to the\nvillage barber? The manners of the great body of the professional men\nmust indicate much of the requisitions of the society they serve.--So,\nalso, must every circumstance connected with the service of society: its\ncharacter, whether slavish or free, abject or prosperous, comprehensive\nor narrow in its uses, must testify to the desires and habits, and\ntherefore to the manners of a community, better than the conversation or\ndeportment of any individual in the society can do. A traveller who\nbears all this in mind can hardly go wrong. Every thing that he looks\nupon will instruct him, from an aqueduct to a punch-bowl, from a\npenitentiary to an aviary, from the apparatus of a university to the\nfurniture of an alehouse or a nursery. When it was found that the chiefs\nof the Red men could not be impressed with any notion of the\ncivilization of the Whites by all that many white men could say, they\nwere brought into the cities of the Whites. The exhibition of a ship was\nenough for some. The warriors of the prairies were too proud to utter\ntheir astonishment,--too noble to hint, even to one another, their fear;\nbut the perspiration stood on their brows as they dumbly gazed, and no\nword of war passed their lips from that hour. Another, who could listen\nwith calmness to the tales of boastful traders in the wilderness, was\nmoved from his apathy by seeing a workman in a glasshouse put a handle\nupon a pitcher. He was transported out of his silence and reserve: he\nseized and grasped the hand of the workman, crying out that it was now\nplain that he had had intercourse with the Great Spirit. By the evidence\nof things these Indians had learned more of the manners of the Whites\nthan had ever been taught them by speech.--Which of us would not learn\nmore of the manners of the Pompeians by a morning's walk among the\nrelics of their abodes and public halls than by many a nightly\nconference with certain of their ghosts?\n\nThe usual scholastic division of Morals is into personal, domestic, and\nsocial or political morals. The three kinds are, however, so apt to run\ninto one another,--so practically inseparable,--that the traveller will\nfind the distinction less useful to him than some others which he can\neither originate or adopt.\n\nIt appears to me that the Morals and Manners of a nation may be included\nin the following departments of inquiry--the Religion of the people;\ntheir prevalent Moral Notions; their Domestic State; their Idea of\nLiberty; and their Progress, actual or in prospect.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nRELIGION.\n\n \"Dieu nous a dit, Peuples, je vous attends.\"\n DE BERANGER.\n\nOf religion, in its widest sense, (the sense in which the traveller must\nrecognize it,) there are three kinds; not in all cases minutely\ndistinguishable, but bearing different general impress; viz. the\nLicentious, the Ascetic, and the Moderate. These kinds are not divided\nfrom each other by the boundaries of sects. We cannot say that pagan\nreligions come under one head, and Mahomedanism under another, and\nChristianity under a third. The difference lies not in creeds, but in\nspirit. Many pagans have been as moderate as any Christians; many\nChristians as licentious as any pagans; many Mahomedans as licentious,\nand many as ascetic, as any pagans or Christians. The truer distinction\nseems to be that the licentious religions of the world worship\nunspiritualized nature,--material objects and their movements, and the\nprimitive passions of man: that the ascetic despises nature, and\nworships its artificial restraints: and that the moderate worships\nspiritualized nature,--God in his works, both in the material universe\nand in the disciplined human mind, with its regulated affections.\n\nThe Licentious religion is always a ritual one. Its gods are natural\nphenomena and human passions personified; and, when once the power of\ndoing good or harm is attributed to them, the idea of propitiation\nenters, and a ritual worship begins. Earthquakes, inundations, the\nchase, love, revenge,--all these agents of evil and good are to be\npropitiated, and sacrifices and prayers are to be offered to them; in\nthese rites alone religious acts are supposed to be performed. This,\nhowever modified, is a low state of religious sentiment. It may show\nitself among the Hindoos dipping in the Ganges, or among Christians who\naccept absolution in its grossest sense. In either case its tendency is\nto render the worshipper satisfied with a low moral state, and to\nperpetuate his taste for selfish indulgence.\n\nThe Ascetic religions are ritual also. The Pharisees of old need but be\ncited to show why; and there is a set of people in the Society Islands\nnow who seem to be spiritually descended from the ascetic priests of\nJudaism. The inhabitants of the Society Islands are excluded from many\ninnocent privileges and natural pleasures by the Tabu; and the Pharisees\nin just the same manner laid burdens upon men's shoulders too heavy to\nbe borne, ordaining irksome ceremonies to be proofs of holiness, and\nextravagant self-denial to be required by devotion. Spiritual licence\nhas always kept pace with this extravagance of self-denial. Spiritual\nvices,--pride, vanity, and hypocrisy,--are as fatal to high morals under\nthis state of religious sentiment as sensual indulgence under the other:\nand it does not matter much to the moral welfare of the people sunk in\nit, whether they exist under a profession of Christianity, or of\nMahomedanism, or of paganism. The morals of those people are low who\nengage themselves to serve God by a slothful life in monastic celibacy,\nno less than those of the Fakîrs, who let their nails grow through the\nbacks of their hands, or those of the wretched mothers in the islands of\nthe Pacific, who strangle their infants, and cast them at the feet of\ntheir grinning idol.\n\nThe Moderate is the least of a ritual religion of the three, and drops\nsuch rites as it has in proportion to its advance towards purity.\nReligion in its purity is not a pursuit, but a temper; and its\nexpression is not by sacrifices, by prayers in the corners of the\nstreets, by fasts or public exhibitions. The highest manifestations of\nthis order of religion are found in Christian countries; though in\nothers there are individuals, and even orders of men, who understand\nthat the orderly enjoyment of all blessings that Providence has\nbestowed, and the regulated workings of all human affections, are the\ntruest homage to the Maker of all. As there are Christians whose\nreliance is upon their ritual worship, and who enter upon a monastic\nlife, so there are Mahomedans and pagans whose high religious aim is\nself-perfection, sought through the free but disciplined exercise of\ntheir whole nature.\n\nThe dependence of morals upon the character of the religion is clear. It\nis clear that among a people whose gods are supposed to be licentious,\nwhose priests are licentious, and where worship is associated with the\nindulgence of the passions, political and domestic morals must be very\nlow. What purity can be expected of a people whose women are demanded\nin turn for the obscene service of the Buddhist temple; and what\nhumanity from the inhabitants of districts whose dwellings are\nnecessarily closed against the multitudes flocking to the festivals of\nJuggernaut,--multitudes from amidst which thousands annually drop down\ndead, so that their skeletons strew the road to the abominable\ntemple?--Where asceticism is the character of the religion, the natural\nand irrepressible exercise of human affections becomes licentiousness,\nso called; and, of consequence, it soon becomes licentiousness in fact,\naccording to the general rule that a bad name changes that to which it\nis affixed into a bad quality.--Hannah and Philip grew up in a Moravian\nsettlement; and, Moravians as they were, they loved. The days came when\nthe destiny of each was decided by lot. It was scarcely possible that\nthey should draw a lot to marry each other; yet both secretly hoped to\nthe last. Philip drew a missionary lot, and Hannah another husband. They\nwere allowed to shake hands once before parting. \"Good-bye, Hannah!\"\n\"Good-bye, Philip!\" was all that was said. If Hannah had gone off with\nPhilip, it would have been called a profligate act; and, if they were\nsound Moravians, it would in fact have been so: whereas, in a community\nof really high morals, the profligacy would have been seen to lie in\nHannah's marrying a man she did not love.\n\nTo proceed with the dependence of the morals on the character of the\nreligion,--it is clear that in proportion as any religion encourages\nlicentiousness, either positively or negatively,--encourages, that is to\nsay, the excess of the passions, might will have the victory over\nright; the weak will succumb to the strong; and thus the condition of\nthe poorer classes depends on the character of the religion of their\ncountry. In proportion as the religion tends to licentiousness, will the\npoorer classes be liable to slavery. In proportion as the religion tends\nto asceticism, will be the amount (other things being equal) of the\nhardship and want which they must sustain. In proportion as the religion\napproximates to the moderate, (the use without the abuse of means of\nenjoyment,) will the poorer classes rise to a condition of freedom and\ncomfort.\n\nThe character of the religion serves, in like manner, as an index to\nthat of the government. A licentious religion cannot be adopted by a\npeople who are so moderate in their passions as to be able to govern\nthemselves. One would not look for a display of meats offered to idols\nin the Capitol of the American Congress. An ascetic religion, too,\ninflicts personal and mutual wrongs which could never be endured among a\npeople who agree to govern one another. There is no power which could\ninduce such to submit to privations and sufferings which can be\ntolerable to none but devotees,--a small fraction of every society.\nAbsolutism is commonly the character of the government of any country\nwhere either of these religions prevails;--a despotism more or less\ntempered by a variety of influences. It is the observer's business to\nbring the religion and the government into comparison, and to see how\nthe latter is modified by the coexistence of the former.\n\nThe friendly, no less than the domestic and political relations of\nsociety, are dependent upon the prevailing religion. Under the\nlicentious, the manners will be made up of the conventional and the\ngross. A Burmese minister was sitting on the poop of a steam-vessel when\na squall came on. \"I suggested to his Excellency,\" says Mr. Crawford,\n\"the convenience of going below, which he long resisted, under the\napprehension of committing his dignity by placing himself in a situation\nwhere persons might tread over his head; for this singular antipathy is\ncommon both to the Burmese and Siamese. The prejudice is more especially\ndirected against the fair sex,--a pretty conclusive proof of the\nestimation in which they are held. His Excellency seriously demanded to\nknow whether any woman had ever trod upon the poop; and, being assured\nin the negative, he consented at length to enter the cabin.\" The house\nfixed for the residence of an American missionary was not allowed to be\nfitted up, as it stood on ground which was higher than the king's barge\nas it lay in the river; and such a spectacle would not become the king's\ndignity. The prime minister of this same king was one day, for absence\nfrom his post at a fire, \"spread out in the hot sun.\" He was extended on\nhis back in the public road for some hours in the most sultry part of\nthe day, with a heavy weight upon his chest,--the public executioners\nbeing employed to administer the punishment. Nor is the king alone\nauthorized to perpetrate such barbarisms. A creditor is permitted to\nseize the wife, children, and slaves of a debtor, and bind them at his\ndoor to broil in the sun of Ava. Here we see in perfection the union of\nthe conventional and the gross in manners; and such manners cannot be\nconceived to coexist with any religion of a higher character than\nBuddhism.\n\nUnder ascetic forms, what grossness there is will be partially\nconcealed; but there will be no nearer an approach to simplicity than\nunder the licentious. The religion being made still to consist much in\nobservances, the society becomes formal in proportion as it believes\nitself growing pure. We must again take an extreme case for an example.\nThe Shakers of America are as sophisticated a set of persons as can be\nfound; with their minds, and even their public discourses, full of the\none subject of their celibacy, and their intercourse with each other\ngraduated according to strict rules of etiquette. So extreme an\nasceticism can never now spread in any nation to such an extent as to\nbear a relation to its general government: but it is observable that\nsuch societies of ascetics live under a despotism;--one of their own\nappointment, if the general will has not furnished them with one.\n\nUnder the moderate aspect of religion is an approximation towards\nsimplicity of social manners alone to be found. There is as yet only a\nremote anticipation of it in any country in the world; only a remote\nanticipation of that ease of social manners which must exist there alone\nwhere the enjoyments of life are freely used without abuse. It matters\nnot that the licentious and the ascetic parties each boast of having\nattained this consummation,--the one under the name of ease, and the\nother of simplicity. There is too much pain attendant upon grossness to\njustify the boast of ease; and too much effort in asceticism to admit of\nthe grace of simplicity. It is the observer's business to mark, wherever\nhe goes, the degree in which the one is chastened and the other relaxed,\ngiving place to the higher form of the moderate, which, if society\nlearns from experience, as the individual does, must finally prevail.\nWhen many individuals of a society attain that self-forgetfulness which\nis promoted by a high and free religious sentiment, but which is\nincompatible with either licentious or ascetic tendencies, the tone of\nmanners in that society will be much raised. When, free from the\ngrossness of self-indulgence, and from the constraint of self-denial,\nevery one spontaneously thinks more of his neighbour than of himself,\nthe world will witness, at last, the perfection of manners. It is clear\nthat the high morals of which such refined manners will be the\nexpression, must greatly depend on the exaltation of the religious\nsentiment from which they emanate.\n\nThe traveller may possibly object the difficulty of classing societies\nby their religious tendencies, and ask whether minds of every sort are\nnot to be found in all numerous assemblages of persons. This is true:\nbut yet there is a prevailing religious sentiment in all communities.\nReligious, like other sentiment, is modified by the strong general\ninfluences under which each society lives; and in it, as in other kinds,\nthere will be general resemblance, with particular differences under it.\nIt is well known that even sects, exclusive in their opinions and\nstraitened by forms, differ in different countries almost as much as if\nthere were no common bond. Not only is episcopacy not the same religion\namong born East Indians as in England, but the Quakers of the United\nStates, though like the English in doctrine and in manners, are easily\ndistinguishable from them in religious sentiment: and even the Jews,\nwho might be expected to be the same all over the world, differ in\nRussia, Persia, and Great Britain as much as if a spirit of division had\nbeen sent among them. They not only appear here in furs, there in cotton\nor silk, and elsewhere in broadcloth; but the hearts they bear beneath\nthe garments, the thoughts that stir under the cap, the turban, and the\nhat, are modified in their action as the skies under which they move are\nin aspect. They are strongly tinctured with the national sentiment of\nRussia, Persia, and England; and if the fond dream of some of them (in\nwhich, by the way, large numbers of their body have ceased to\nsympathize,) could come true, and they should ever be brought together\nwithin their ancient borders, they would find that their religion, so\nunique in its fixedness, though one in word, is many in spirit.--Much\nmore easy is the assimilation between different forms of Christianity,\nand between Christianity and an elevated natural religion: and the\nsearch can never therefore be in vain for a pervading religious\nsentiment among the various religious institutions of any and every\npeople.\n\nIt is, of course, more difficult to discover this religious sentiment\namong a nation enlightened enough to be divided in theological matters,\nthan among a rude people who regulate their devotions by the bidding of\na single order of priests. The African traveller, passing up the Niger,\nsees at a glance what all the worshippers on the banks feel, and must\nfeel, towards the deities to whom their temples are erected. A rude\nshed, with a doll,--an image of deformity,--perched on a stand, and\nsupposed to be enjoying the fumes of the cooking going on before his\nface;--a place of worship like this, in its character of the habitation\nof a deity, and of a sensual deity, leaves no doubt as to what the\nreligious sentiment of a country must be where there is no dissent from\nsuch a worship. In such a society there are absolutely none to feel that\ntheir deep palm groves are a nobler temple than human hands can rear.\nThere are none who see that it is by a large divine benignity that all\nthe living creatures of that region are made happy in their rank\nseclusion. There is no feeling of gratitude in the minds of those who\nsee the myriads of gay butterflies that flit in the glare of noon, and\nthe river-horse which bathes in the shady places of the mysterious great\nstream. There a god is seen only in his temple, and there is nothing\nknown of any works of his. That he is great, is learned only through the\nword of his priests, who say that yams are too common a food for him,\nand that nothing less than hippopotamus' flesh must be cooked beneath\nhis shrine. That he is good is an idea which has not yet entered any\nmind.--In other places, the religious sentiment is almost equally\nunquestionable; as when every man in Cairo is seen in his turn to put on\nthe dress of pilgrimage, and direct his steps to Mount Arafat. Here the\nsentiment is of a higher order, but equally evident and uniform.--A\nfurther advance, with somewhat less uniformity of sentiment, is found\namong the followers of the Greek church in a Russian province. The\npeasants there make a great point of having time for their devotions;\nand those who have the wherewithal to offer some showy present at a\nshrine are complacent. They make the sign of the cross, and have therein\ndone their whole duty: and if some speculative worshipper of the Virgin\nwith Three Hands is not satisfied about the way in which his patroness\ncame by her third hand, he keeps his doubts to himself when he tells his\nsins to his confessor.--A still further advance, with an increased\ndiversity, may be met with among the simple Vaudois, the general\ncharacteristics of whose faith are alike, but who entertain it, some\nmore in the spirit of fear, others more in the spirit of love. The\nprevailing sentiment among them is of the ascetic character, as the\nstranger may perceive, who sees the peasantry marching in serene gravity\nto their plain places of worship on the mountain pinnacle, or under the\nshelter yielded by a clump of black pines amidst a waste of snow: but\nhere the clergy are more guides than dictators; and not a few may be\nfound who doubt their opinions, and find matter for thoughtless delight,\nrather than religious awe, when they follow the echoes from steep to\nsteep, and watch for the gleams of the summer lightning playing among\nthe defiles.--The diversity grows more striking as civilization\nadvances; but it has not yet become perplexing in the most enlightened\nnations in the world. In England, in France, in America, there is a\ndistinct religious sentiment: in England, where there is every variety\nof dissent from the established faith; in America, where there is every\nvariety of opinion, and no establishment at all; and in France, now in\nthat state which most baffles observation,--a state of transition from\nan exaggerated superstition to a religious faith which is being groped\nfor, but is not yet found. Even in this uncertain state, no one can\nconfound the religious sentiment of New England and of France; and an\nobservation of their places of worship will indicate their differences.\nIn New England, the populous towns have their churches in the midst,\nspacious and conspicuous,--not exhibiting any of the signs of antique\norigin which are impressed on those of Europe, and to be accounted for\nonly by the immediate religious tastes of the people. In new\nsettlements, the church rises side by side with the house of\nentertainment, and is obviously considered one of the necessaries of\nsocial life. The first thing to be learned about a fresh inhabitant is,\nhow he stands disposed towards the church, whatever may be its\ndenomination. In France, such of the old churches as are still used for\ntheir ancient purpose, bespeak a ritual religion, and therefore a\nreligion light and gay in its spirit; all religions being so which cast\nresponsibility into outward observances, especially where the outward\nobservances are not of a very burdensome character. If nuns in their\ncloister, and Jews in their synagogues, have been characterized by the\nlightness of their religious spirit, well may the Catholics of an\nenlightened country be so, discarding the grossest and most burdensome\nof their rites, and retaining the ritual principle. The searchers after\na new faith in France must increase by millions before they can change\nthe character of the religious sentiment of the country; and perhaps\nbefore that which is now gross can be elevated into what is genial, and\nbefore a mixture of levity and fear can be changed into the cheerful\nearnestness of a moderate or truly catholic religious conviction, the\nancient churches of France may be standing in ruins,--objects for the\nresearch of the antiquary.\n\nThe rule of examining things before persons must be observed in\nascertaining the religious sentiment of any country. A stranger in\nEngland might interrogate everybody he saw, and be little wiser at the\nend of a year. He might meet a fanatic one day, an indifferent person\nthe next, and a calmly convinced one the third: he might go from a\nChurchman to a Jew; from a Jew to a Quaker; from a Quaker to a Catholic;\nand every day be farther from understanding the prevailing religious\nsentiment of the country. A much shorter and surer method is, to examine\nthe Places of Worship, the condition of the Clergy, the Popular\nSuperstitions, the observance of Holy Days, and some other particulars\nof the kind.\n\n * * * * *\n\nFirst, for the Churches. There is that about all places of worship which\nmay tell nearly as plain a tale as the carved idols, with messes of rice\nbefore them, in Hindoo temples; or as the human bones hung round the hut\nof an African god. The proportion and resemblance of modern places of\nworship to those which were built in dark times of superstition; the\nsuitability or incongruity of all that is of late introduction into\ntheir furniture and worship with what had its origin in those dim\nages;--such circumstances as these cannot but indicate whether the\ncommon religious sentiment is as nearly as possible the same as in\ncenturies past, or whether it is approximating, slowly or rapidly,\ntowards the ascetic or the moderate.\n\nThere is evidence in the very forms of churches. The early Christian\nchurches were in the basilica form,--bearing a resemblance to the Roman\ncourts of justice. This is supposed to have arisen from the churches\nbeing, in fact, the courts of spiritual justice, where penance was\nawarded by the priest to the guilty, and absolution granted to the\npenitent. From imitation, the Christian churches of all Europe for\ncenturies bore this form; and even some built since the Reformation\npreserve it. But they have something of their own which serves as a\nrecord of their own times. The history of the Crusades does not present\na more vivid picture of feudal society than shines out from the nooks of\nour own cathedrals. The spirit of monachism is as distinguishable as if\nthe cowled ghosts of the victims were actually seen flitting along the\naisles. What say the chantries ranged along the sides? There perpetual\nprayers were to be kept up for the prosperity of a wealthy family and\nits retainers in life, and for their welfare after death. What says the\nchapter-house? There the powerful members of the church hierarchy were\nwont to assemble, to use and confirm their rule. What say the cloisters?\nUnder their shelter did the monks go to and fro in life; and in the plot\nof ground enclosed by these sombre passages were they laid in death.\nWhat says the Ladye chapel? What say the niches with their stone basins?\nThey tell of the intercessory character of the sentiment, and of the\nritual character of the worship of the times when they were set up. The\nhandful of worshippers here collected from among the tens of thousands\nof a cathedral town also testify to the fact that such establishments\ncould not be originated now, and are no longer in harmony with the\nspirit of the multitude.--The contrast of the most modern sacred\nbuildings tells as plain a tale:--the red-brick meeting-house of the\nFriends; the stone chapel of the less rigid dissenters, standing back\nfrom the noise of the busy street; the aristocratic chapel nestling\namidst the shades of the nobleman's park; and the village church in the\nmeadow, with its neighbouring parsonage. These all tell of a diversity\nof opinion; but also of something else. The more ancient buildings are\nscantily attended; the more modern are thronged;--and indeed, if they\nhad not been wanted by numbers, they would not have been built. This\nspeaks the decline of a ritual religion, and the preference of one which\nis more exclusively spiritual in its action.\n\nIn Scotland the kirks look exactly suitable to the population which\nthrongs towards them, with sober dress and gait, and countenances of\nsolemnity. These edifices stand in severe simplicity, whether on the\ngreen shore of a lake, or in the narrow street of a town; and asceticism\nis marked on every stone of the walls, and every article of their\ndecorations.\n\nNo one who has travelled in Ireland can forget the aspect of its places\nof worship,--the lowly Catholic chapels, with their beggarly ornaments\nof lace and crucifixes, placed in the midst of villages, the whole of\nwhose inhabitants crowd within those four walls; and a little way off,\nin a field, or on an eminence by the road side, the Protestant church,\none end in ruins, and with ample harbourage for the owl, while the rest\nis encompassed with nettles and thorns, and the mossy grave-stones are\nhalf hidden by rank grass. In a country where the sun rises upon\ncontrasts like these, it is clear in what direction the religious\nsentiment of the people is indulged.\n\nWhat the stranger may thus learn in our own country, we may learn in\nhis, whatever it be. The large plain churches of Massachusetts, their\ndemocratic benches (in the absence of aristocratic pews) silently filled\nfor long hours of a Sabbath, as still as a summer noon, by hundreds and\nthousands who restore the tones of their pilgrim ancestors in their\nhymn-singing, and seem to carry about their likeness in their faces,\ncannot fail to instruct the observer.--Then there is the mosque at\nCairo, with its great tank or fountain of ablution in the midst; and its\nbroad pavement spread out for men of every degree to kneel on together;\nits doors standing wide from sunrise to sunset, for the admission of all\nbut women and strangers; its outside galleries, from which the summons\nto prayer is sounded;--these things testify to the ritual character of\nthe worship, and to the low type of the morals of a faith which despises\nwomen and strangers, giving privileges to the strong from which the weak\nare excluded.--Then there is the Buddhist temple, rearing its tapering\nform in a recess of the hills, with its colossal stone figures guarding\nthe entrance, and others sanctifying the interior,--all eloquently\nexplaining that physical force is worshipped here: its images of saints\nshow that the intercessory superstition exists; and the drum and gong,\nemployed to awaken the attention of the gods, can leave little danger of\nmisapprehension to the observer. There are lanterns continually burning,\nand consecrated water, sanctified to the cure of diseased eyes.--Such\nplaces of worship tell a very plain tale; while there is not perhaps a\nchurch on earth which does not convey one that is far from obscure.\n\nThe traveller must diligently visit the temples of nations; he must mark\ntheir locality, whether placed among men's dwellings or apart from them;\ntheir number, whether multiplied by diversity of theological opinion;\nand their aspect, whether they are designed for the service of a ritual\nor a spiritual religion. Thus he may, at the same time, ascertain the\ncharacter of the most prominent form of religion, and that of the\ndissent from it; which must always illustrate each other.\n\n * * * * *\n\nNext to the Churches comes the consideration of the Clergy. The clergy\nare usually the secondary potentates of a young country. In a young\ncountry, physical force, and that which comes to represent it, is the\nfirst great power; and knowledge is the next. The clergy are the first\nlearned men of every nation; and when the streams of knowledge are only\njust issuing from the fountain, and the key is in the hands of the\nclergy, they enjoy, rightly and unavoidably, a high degree of\nconsequence. Knowledge spreads abroad; and it is as impossible for man\nto dam it up as for the fool to stop the Danube by filling the narrow\nchannel at its source with his great boots,--crying out the while, \"How\nthe people will wonder when the Danube does not come!\" As knowledge\nbecomes diffused, the consequence of the clergy declines. If that\nconsequence is to be preserved, it must be by their attaining the same\nsuperiority in morals which they once held in intellect. Where the\nclergy are now a cherished class, it is, in fact, on the supposition of\nthis moral superiority,--a claim for whose justification it would be\nunreasonable to look, and for the forfeiture of which the clergy should\nbe less blamed than those who expect that, in virtue of a profession,\nany class of men should be better than others. Moral excellence has no\nregard to classes and professions; and religion, being not a pursuit but\na temper, cannot, in fact, be professionally cultivated with personal\nadvantage. It will be for the traveller to note whether this is more or\nless understood where he travels; whether the clergy are viewed with\nindifference as mere professional men; or whether they are reverenced\nfor their supposed holiness; or for their real superiority in learning;\nor whether the case wears the lowest aspect of all--when the clergy are\nmerely the jugglers and puppet-masters of the multitude. A patient\nconsideration of this will lead to a pretty safe conclusion as to the\nprogress the people have made in knowledge, and the spiritual freedom\nwhich it brings;--a freedom which is at once a virtue and a cause of\nvirtue.\n\nThe observer must note what the clergy themselves consider their\nfunction to be;--whether to guide individual minds; or to cultivate\ntheological and other studies, in order to place their results at the\ndisposal of the minds with which they have to deal; or to express in\nworship the feelings of those minds; or to influence the social\ninstitutions by which the minds of the people are modified; or to do any\nother of the many things which the priests of different countries, and\nages, and faiths, have in turn included in their function. He will note\nwhether they are most like the tyrannical Brahmins, who at one\nstroke--by declaring the institution of Caste to be of divine\nauthority--obtained boundless control over a thousand generations,\nsubjecting all intellects and all hands to a routine which could be\neasily superintended by the forty thousand of the favoured priestly\nrace; or whether they are like the Christian clergy of the dark ages, a\npart of whose duty it was to learn the deepest secrets of the proudest\nand lowliest,--thus obtaining the means of bringing to pass what events\nthey wished, both in public and private life;--or whether they are like\nsuch students as have been known in the theological world,--men who have\nnot crossed the threshold of their libraries for eighteen years, and who\nare satisfied with their lives, if they have been able to elevate\nBiblical science, and to throw any new light on sacred history;--or\nwhether they are like the American clergy of the present day, whose\nexertions are directed towards the art of preaching;--or whether they\nare like the ministers of the Established Church in England, who are\npolitically represented, and large numbers of whom employ their\ninfluence for political purposes. Each of these kinds of clergy must be\nyielded by a particular state of society, and could not belong to any\nother. The Hindoos must be in a low degree of civilization, and sunk in\na deadly superstition, or they would tolerate no Brahmins. The people of\nfour centuries ago must have depended solely upon their priests for\nknowledge and direction, or they would not have submitted to their\ninquisitorial practices. Germany must have advanced far in her\nappreciation of philosophical and critical research in theology, or she\nwould not have such devoted students as she can boast of. The Americans\ncannot have attained to any high practice of spiritual liberty, or they\ncould not follow preaching so zealously as they do. The English cannot\nhave fully understood, or taken to heart the principles of the\nReformation, which have so long been their theme of eulogy, or they\nwould not foster a political hierarchy within the bosom of their church.\n\nAs the studies of the clergy lie in the past, as the days of their\nstrongest influence are behind, and as the religious feelings of men\nhave hitherto reposed on the antique, and are but just beginning to\npoint towards the future, it is natural, it is unavoidable, that the\nclergy should retard rather than aid the progress of society. A\ndisposition to assist in the improvement of institutions is what ought\nnot to be looked for from any priestly class; and, if looked for, it\nwill not be found. Such a mode of operation must appear to them\nsuicidal. But much may be learned by comparing the degree of clerical\nresistance to progression with the proportion of favour in which the\nclergy are held by the people. Where that resistance is greatest, and a\nclerical life is one of peculiar worldly ease, the state of morals and\nmanners must be low. Where that resistance is least, where any social\nimprovement whatever is found to originate with the clergy, and where\nthey bear a just share of toil, the condition of morals and manners\ncannot be very much depressed. Where there is an undue partition of\nlabour and its rewards among the clergy themselves,--where some do the\nwork and others reap the recompence,--the fair inference is that morals\nand manners are in a state of transition. Such a position of affairs\ncannot be a permanent one; and the observer may be assured that the\nmorals and manners of the people are about to be better than they have\nbeen.--The characteristics of the clergy will indicate, or at least\ndirect attention to, the characteristics of dissent: and any extensive\nform of dissent is no other than the most recent exposition of the\nlatest condition of morals among a large, active, and influential\nportion of the people. A foreign traveller in Germany, in Luther's time,\ncould learn but little of the moral state of that empire, if he shut his\neyes to the philosophy and the deeds of the reformers. If he saw nothing\nin the train of nuns winding down into the valleys from their now\nunconsecrated convent on the steep; if the tidings of the marriage of\nCatherine de Boria came to him like any other wedding news; if he did\nnot mark the subdued triumph in family faces when the Book--Luther's\nBible--was brought out for the daily lecture; if the decrees of Worms\nseemed to him like the common orders of the church, and the levelling of\naltars and unroofing of crypts was in his eyes but masons' work, he was\nnot qualified to observe the people of Germany, and had no more title to\nreport of them than if he had never left home. Thus it is now, in less\nextreme cases. The traveller in Spain knows little of the Spaniards\nunless he is aware of the theological studies, and the worship without\nforms, which are carried on in private by those who are keeping alive\nthe fires of liberty in that priest and tyrant-ridden country. The\nforeigner in England will carry away but a partial knowledge of the\nreligious sentiment of the people if he enters only the cathedrals of\ncities and the steepled churches in the villages, passing by the square\nmeeting-houses in the manufacturing towns, and hearing nothing of the\nconferences, the assemblies, and the missionary enterprises of the\ndissenters. The same may be said of observation in every country\nenlightened enough to have shaken off its subservience to an\nunquestioned and irresponsible priesthood: that is, of every country\nadvanced enough to maintain dissent.\n\nThe expressions of established forms of prayer convey more information\nas to the state of the clergy than of the people; since these\nexpressions are furnished by the clergy, and continue to be prompted by\nthem, while the people have no means of dismissing or changing the words\nof their framed prayers for long after the words may have ceased to\nrepresent the feeling. The traveller will receive such objectionable\nexpressions as he may hear, not as indications of the then present\nsentiments of the crowd of worshippers, but rather as evidencing the\ndisinclination of the clergy to change. It would be hard, for instance,\nto impute to Moslem worshippers in general the formation of such desires\nas are uttered by the school-boys of Cairo at the close of their daily\nattendance. \"O God! destroy the infidels and polytheists, thine enemies,\nthe enemies of the religion! O God! make their children orphans, and\ndefile their abodes, and cause their feet to slip, and give them and\ntheir families, and their households, and their women, and their\nchildren, and their relations by marriage, and their brothers, and their\nfriends, and their possessions, and their race, and their wealth, and\ntheir lands, as booty to the Moslems! O Lord of all creatures!\"--It\nwould be unjust to impute a horror of \"sudden death\" to all who use the\nwords of prayer against it which are found in the Litany of the Church\nof England. Sudden death deserved to be classed among the most deadly\nevils when the Litany was framed,--in the days of the viaticum; but now\nit would be unjust to a multitude of worshippers who use the Litany to\nsuppose that they are afraid to commit themselves to the hands of their\nFather without a passport from a priest; and that they are not willing\nto die in the way which pleases God,--some rather preferring, probably,\na mode which will save those who are nearest and dearest to them the\nanguish of suspense, or of witnessing hopeless decline. In all antique\nforms of devotion there must be expressions which are inconsistent with\nthe philosophy and the tastes of the time; and these are to be regarded\ntherefore as no indications of such philosophy and taste, but as an\nevidence, more or less distinct, of the condition of the clergy in\nenlightenment and temper.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThe splendid topic of human Superstitions can be only just touched upon\nhere. In this boundless field, strewn with all the blossoms of all\nphilosophy, the human observer may wander for ever. He can never have\ndone culling the evidence that it presents, or enjoying the promise\nwhich it yields. All that we can now do is just to suggest that as the\nsuperstitions of all nations are the embodiment of their idealized\nconvictions, the state of religious sentiment may be learned from them\nalmost without danger of mistake.\n\nNo society is without its superstitions, any more than it is without its\nconvictions and its imaginations. Even under the moderate form of\nreligion, there is room for superstition; and the ascetic, which glories\nin having put away the superstitions of the licentious forms, has\nsuperstitions of its own.--The followers of an ascetic religion have\nmore or less belief in judgments,--in retributive evils, arbitrarily\ninflicted. Among them may be gathered a harvest of tales of divine\ninterference,--from the bee stinging the tip of the swearer's tongue to\nthe sudden death of false witnesses. Among them do superstitions about\ntimes and seasons flourish, even to the forgetfulness that the Sabbath\nis made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. Some ascetics have faith\nin the lot,--like the Moravians in ordering marriage, or Wesley in\nopening his Bible to light upon texts. Others believe in warnings of\nevil; and most dread the commission of ritual fully as much as of moral\nsins. To play even a hymn tune on the piano on Sundays is an offence in\nthe Highlands of Scotland; and to miss prayers is a matter of penance in\na convent. The superstitions of the ascetic are scarcely fewer or more\nmoderate than those of the licentious form of religion; the chief\ndifference between the two lies in the spirit from which they emanate.\nThe superstitions of the ascetic arise from the spirit of fear; those of\nthe heathen arise perhaps equally from the spirit of love and the spirit\nof fear.\n\nIt seems as if the portents which present themselves to ascetic\nminds must necessarily be of evil, since the only good which their\nimaginations admit is supposed to be secured by grace, and by acts of\nservice or self-denial. To the Fakîr, to the Shaker, to the nun, no\ngood remains over and above what has been long claimed, while\npunishment may follow any breach of observance. On the other hand,\nbefore one who makes himself gods of the movements of inanimate nature\nand human passions, the two worlds of evil and good lie open, and he\nis perpetually on the watch for messengers from both. The poor pagan\nlooks for tokens of his gods being pleased or angry; of their\nintentions of giving him a good or a bad harvest; or of their sending\nhim a rich present or afflicting him with a bereavement. Whatever he\nwants to know, he seeks for in portents;--whether he shall live\nagain,--whether his departed friends think of him,--whether his child\nshall be fortunate or wretched,--whether his enemy or he shall\nprevail. It is open to the traveller's observation whether these\nsuperstitions are of a generous or selfish kind,--whether they elevate\nthe mind with hope, or depress it with fear,--whether they nourish the\nfaith of the spirit, or extort merely the service of the lip and hand.\n\nThe Swiss herdsmen believe that the three deliverers (the founders of\nthe Helvetic Confederacy) sleep calmly in a cave near the Lake of\nLucerne; and that, whenever their country is in her utmost need, they\nwill come forth in their antique garb, and assuredly save her. This is a\nsuperstition full of veneration and hope.--When the Arabs see a falling\nstar, they believe it to be a dart thrown by God at a wanderer of the\nrace of the genii, and they exclaim, \"May God transfix the enemy of the\nfaith!\" Here we find in brief the spirit of their religion.--In Brazil,\na bird which sings plaintively at night is listened to with intent\nemotion, from its being supposed to be sent with tidings from the dead\nto the living. The choice of a bird with a mournful instead of a lively\nnote speaks volumes.--The three angels in white that come to give\npresents to good children in Germany at Christmas, come in a good\nspirit.--There is a superstition in China which has a world of\ntenderness in it. A father collects a hundred copper coins from a\nhundred families, and makes the metal into a lock which he hangs, as a\ncharm, round his child's neck, believing that he locks his child to life\nby this connection with a hundred persons in full vigour.--But, as is\nnatural, death is the region of the Unseen to which the larger number of\nportents relates. The belief of the return of the dead has been held\nalmost universally among the nations; and their unseen life is the grand\ntheme of speculation wherever there are men to speculate. The Norwegians\nlay the warrior's horse, and armour, and weapons, beside him. The\nHindoos burn the widow. The Malabar Indians release caged birds on the\nnewly-made grave, to sanction the flight of the soul. The Buccaneers\n(according to Penrose) concealed any large booty that fell into their\nhands, till they should have leisure to remove it,--murdering and\nburying near it any helpless wretch whom they might be able to capture,\nin order that his spirit might watch over the treasure, and drive from\nthe spot all but the parties who had signed their names in a\nround-robin, in claim of proprietorship. The professors of many faiths\nresemble each other in practices of propitiation or atonement\nlaboriously executed on behalf of the departed. Some classes of mourners\nact towards their dead friends in a spirit of awe; some in fear; but\nvery many in love. The trust in the immortality of the affections is the\nmost general feature in superstitions of this class; and it is a fact\neloquent to the mind of the observer.--An only child of two poor savages\ndied. The parents appeared inconsolable; and the father soon sank under\nhis grief. From the moment of his death, the mother was cheerful. On\nbeing asked what had cheered her, she said she had mourned for her\nchild's loneliness in the world of spirits: now he had his father with\nhim, and she was happy for them both. What a divine spirit of\nself-sacrifice is here! but there is scarcely a superstition sincerely\nentertained which does not tell as plain a tale. Those which express\nfear indicate moral abasement, greater or less. Those which express\ntrust and love indicate greater or less moral elevation and purity.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThe practice of Suicide is worth the contemplation of a traveller, as\naffording some clear indications as to religious sentiment. Suicide in\nthe largest sense is here intended,--the voluntary surrender of life\nfrom any cause.\n\nThere has been a stage in the moral advancement of every nation when\nsuicide, in one form or another, has been considered a duty; and it is\nimpossible to foresee the time when it will cease to be so considered.\nIt was a necessary result from the idea of honour once prevalent in the\nmost civilized societies, when men and women destroyed themselves to\navoid disgrace. The defeated warrior, the baffled statesman, the injured\nwoman, destroyed themselves when the hope of honour was gone. In the\nsame age, as in every succeeding one, there have been suicides who have\ndevoted themselves for others, presenting a series of tales which may\nalmost redeem the disgraces which darken the annals of the race.--The\nmost illustrious of the Christian Fathers, immersed in the superstitions\nabout the transcendent excellence of the virtue of chastity which have\nextinguished so many other virtues, and injured the morals of society to\nthis day, by sacrificing other principles to fanaticism on this,\npermitted women to kill themselves to escape from violence which left\nthe mind in its purity, and the will in its rectitude.--Martyrdom for\nthe truth existed also before the venerating eyes of men,--the noblest\nkind of suicide: it attracted glory to itself from the faithful heart of\nthe race; and, from its thus attracting glory, it became a means of\ngaining glory, and sank from being martyrdom to be a mere fanatical\nself-seeking. While the spirit of persecution was roaming abroad,\nseeking whom it might devour, there were St. Theresas roaming abroad,\nseeking to be devoured, from a spirit of cupidity after the crown of\nmartyrdom.--Soldiers, in all times and circumstances, pledge themselves\nto the possible duty of suicide by the very act of becoming soldiers.\nThey engage to make the first charge, and to mount a breach if called\nupon. And there have been found soldiers for every perilous service that\nhas been required, throughout all wars. There have been volunteers to\nmount the breach, solitary men or small bands to hold narrow bridges and\npasses, from the first incursion of tribe upon tribe in barbarous\nconflict, up to the suicide of Van Speyk, whose monument is still fresh\nfrom the chisel in the Nieuw Kerk of Amsterdam. Van Speyk commanded a\ngun-boat which was stranded in a heavy gale, and boarded by the\nBelgians,--the foe. Van Speyk had sworn never to surrender his boat, and\nhis suicide was a point of military honour. He seems to have considered\nthe matter thus; for he prayed for pardon of his crime of\nself-destruction after laying his lighted cigar on the open barrel of\npowder which blew up the boat. The remaining suicides (except, of\ncourse, the insane,) are justified by none. Persons who shrink from\nsuffering so far as to withdraw from their duties, and to forsake those\nto whom their exertions are due, are objects of contemptuous compassion\nin the present day, when, moral having succeeded to physical force in\nmen's esteem, it is seen to be nobler to endure evils than to hide one's\nspirit from them.\n\nEvery society has its suicides, and much may be learned from their\ncharacter and number, both as to the notions on morals which prevail,\nand the religious sentiment which animates to or controls the act. It is\nwith the last that we now have to do.--The act of laying down life is\none thing among a people who have dim and mournful anticipations of a\nfuture life, like the ancient Greeks; and quite another among those who,\nlike the first Christians, have a clear vision of bliss and triumph in\nthe world on which they rush. Suicide is one thing to a man who is\ncertain of entering immediately upon purgatory; and to another whose\nfirst step is to be upon the necks of his enemies; and to a third who\nbelieves that he is to lie conscious in his grave for some thousands of\nyears; and to a fourth who has no idea that he shall survive or revive\nat all. When Curtius leaped into the gulf, he probably leaped into utter\ndarkness, other than physical; but when Guyon of Marseilles sunned\nhimself for the last time in the balcony of the house where he was shut\nup with the plague-spotted body which he was to die in dissecting, he\nhad faith that he should step out of a waxing and waning sunlight into a\nregion which \"had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in\nit, the glory of God being the light of it.\" The sick Moslem who,\nfalling behind his troop, and fearing to lie unburied, scoops his grave\nand lies down in it, wrapped in his grave-clothes, and covers himself\nup, except the face, leaving it to the winds to heap sand upon it,\ntrembles the while at the thought of the two examining angels, who are\nthis night to prove and perhaps torture him. The English lady who took\nlaudanum on learning that she had a fatal disease, from fear of becoming\nloathsome to a husband for whom she had lived, had before her the\nprominent idea of reunion with him; so that life in one world presented\nas much of hope as in the other of despair.--Nations share in\ndifferences like these, according to the prevalent religious sentiment;\nand from this species of act may the sentiment be more or less correctly\ninferred.\n\nSuicide is very common among a race of Africans who prefer it to\nslavery. They believe in a life of tropical ease and freedom after\ndeath, and rush into it so eagerly on being reduced to slavery, that\nthe planters of Cuba refuse them in the market, knowing that after a few\nhours, or days, in spite of all precautions, nothing but their dead\nbodies will remain in the hands of their masters. The French have, of\nlate years, abounded in suicides, while there are few or none in\nIreland. The most vain and the most sympathetic part of the French\nmultitude were found to be the classes which yielded the victims. If a\nyoung lady and her lover shot one another with pistols tied with pink\nribbons, two or three suicides amidst blue and green ribbons were sure\nto follow the announcement of the first in the newspaper, till a\nsensible physician suggested that suicides should not be noticed in\nnewspapers, or should be treated with ridicule: the advice was acted\nupon, and proved by the result to be sound. This profusion of\nself-murders could not have taken place amidst a serious belief of an\nimmediate entrance upon purgatory, such as is held by the majority of\nthe Irish. Only in a state of vague speculation as to another life could\nthe future have operated as so slight a check upon the rash impulses of\nthe present. The Irish, an impetuous race, like the French, and with a\ngood share of vanity, of sympathy, and of sentiment, are probably\ndeterred from throwing away life by those religious convictions and\nsentiments which the French once held in an equal degree, but from which\nthey are now passing over into another state.\n\nA single act of suicide is often indicative, negatively or positively,\nof a state of prevalent sentiment. A single instance of the Suttee\ntestifies to the power of Brahmins, and the condition of Hindoo\nworshippers, in a way which cannot be mistaken. An American child of\nsix years old accidentally witnessed in India such a spectacle. On\nreturning home, she told her mother she had seen hell, and was whipped\nfor saying so,--not knowing why, for she spoke in all earnestness, and,\nas it seems to us, with eloquent truth.--The somewhat recent\nself-destruction of an estimable English officer, on the eve of a\ncourt-martial, might fully instruct a stranger on the subject of\nmilitary honour in this country. This officer fell in the collision of\nuniversal and professional principles. His justice and humanity had led\nhim to offer a kindly bearing towards an irresolute mob of rioters, in\nthe absence of authority to act otherwise than as he did, and of all\nco-operation from the civil power; his military honour was placed in\njeopardy, and the innocent man preferred self-destruction to meeting the\nrisk; thus testifying that numbers here sustain an idea of honour which\nis at variance with that which they expect to prevail elsewhere and\nhereafter.--Every act of self-devotion for others, extending to death,\ntestifies to the existence of philanthropy, and to its being regarded as\nan honour and a good. Every voluntary martyrdom tells a national tale as\nplain as that written in blood and spirit by Arnold Von Winkelried, in\n1386. When the Swiss met their oppressors at the battle of Sempach, it\nappeared impossible for the Swiss to charge with effect, so thick was\nthe hedge of Austrian lances. Arnold Von Winkelried cried, \"I will make\na lane for you! Dear companions, remember my family!\" He clasped an\narmful of the enemy's lances, and made a sheaf of them in his body. His\ncomrades entered the breach, and won the battle. They remembered his\nfamily, and their descendants commemorate the sacrifice to this day;\nthus bearing testimony to the act being a trait of the national spirit.\n\nBy observations such as these, may the religious sentiment of a people\nbe ascertained. While making them, or struggling with the difficulties\nof opposing evidence, the observer has to bear in mind,--first, that the\nreligious sentiment does everywhere exist, however low its tone, and\nhowever uncouth its expression; secondly, that personal morals must\ngreatly depend on the low or high character of the religious sentiment;\nand, thirdly, that the philosophy and morals of government accord with\nboth,--despotism of some sort being the natural rule where licentious\nand ascetic religions prevail; and democratic government being possible\nonly under a moderate form of religion, where the use without the abuse\nof all blessings is the spirit of the religion of the majority.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nGENERAL MORAL NOTIONS.\n\n \"Une différente coutume donnera d'autres principes naturels. Cela\n se voit par expérience; et s'il y en a d'ineffaçables à la coutume,\n il y en a aussi de la coutume ineffaçables à la nature.\"--PASCAL.\n\nNext to the religion of a people, it is necessary to learn what are\ntheir Ideas of Morals. In speaking of the popular notion of a Moral\nSense, it was mentioned that, so far from there being a general\nagreement on the practice of morals, some things which are considered\neminently right in one age or country are considered eminently wrong in\nanother; while the people of each age or country, having grown up under\ncommon influences, think and feel sufficiently alike to live together in\na general agreement as to right and wrong. It is the business of the\ntraveller to ascertain what this general agreement is in the society he\nvisits.\n\nIn one society, spiritual attainments will be the most highly honoured,\nas in most religious communities. In another, the qualities attendant\nupon intellectual eminence will be worshipped,--as now in countries\nwhich are the most advanced in preparation for political\nfreedom,--France, Germany, and the United States. In others, the moral\nqualities allied to physical or extrinsic power are chiefly\nvenerated,--as in all uncivilized countries, and all which lie under\nfeudal institutions.\n\nThe lower moral qualities which belong to the last class have been\ncharacteristics of nations. The valour of the Spartans, the love of\nglory of the Romans and the French, the pride of the Spaniards,--these\ninfantile moral qualities have belonged to a people as distinctly as to\nan individual.--Those which are in alliance with intellectual eminence\nare not so strikingly characteristic of entire nations; though we praise\nthe Athenians for their love of letters and honour of philosophy; the\nItalians for their liberality towards art, and their worship of it while\na meaner glory was the fashion of the world; the Germans for their\nspeculative enterprise, and patience of research; and the Americans for\ntheir reverence for intellect above military fame and the splendour of\nwealth.--No high spiritual qualities have ever yet characterized a\nnation, or even--in spite of much profession--any considerable\ncommunity. Hospitality and beneficence have distinguished some religious\nsocieties: the non-resistance of Quakers, the industry of Moravians, and\nof several kinds of people united on the principle of community of\nproperty, may be cited: but this seems to be all. The enforced\ntemperance, piety, and chastity of monastic societies go for nothing in\nthis view; because, being enforced, they indicate nothing of the\nsentiment subsequent to the taking of the vow. The people of the United\nStates have come the nearest to being characterized by lofty spiritual\nqualities. The profession with which they set out was high,--a\ncircumstance greatly to their honour, though (as might have been\nexpected) they have not kept up to it. They are still actuated by\nambition of territory, and have not faith enough in moral force to rely\nupon it, as they profess to do. The Swiss, in their unshaken and\nsingularly devoted love of freedom, seem to be spiritually distinguished\nabove other nations: but they have no other strong characteristic of\nthis highest class.\n\nThe truth is that, whatever may be the moral state of nations when the\nhuman world emerges hereafter from its infancy, high spiritual qualities\nare now matters of individual concern, as those of the intellectual\nclass were once; and their general prevalence is a matter of prospective\nvision alone. Time was when the swampy earth resounded with the tramp\nand splash of monstrous creatures, whom there was no reason present to\nclassify, and no language to name. Then, after a certain number of ages,\nthe earth grew drier; palm-groves and tropical thickets flourished where\nParis now stands; and the waters were collected into lakes in the\nregions where the armies of Napoleon were of late encamped. Then came\nthe time when savage, animal man appeared, using his physical force like\nthe lower animals, and taught by the experience of its deficiency that\nhe was in possession of another kind of force. Still, for ages, the use\nhe made of reason was to overcome the physical force of others, and to\nrender available his own portion. On this principle, and for this\nobject, variously modified, and more or less refined, have societies\nbeen formed to this day; though, as morals are the fruit of which\nintellect is the blossom, spiritualism--faith in moral power--has\nexisted in individuals ever since the first free exercise of reason.\nWhile all nations were ravaging one another as they had opportunity,\nthere were always parents who did not abuse their physical power over\ntheir children. In the midst of a general worship of power, birth, and\nwealth, the affections have wrought out in individual minds a preference\nof obscurity and poverty for the sake of spiritual objects. Amidst the\nsupremacy of the worship of honour and social ease, there have always\nbeen confessors who could endure disgrace for the truth, and martyrs who\ncould die for it.--Such individual cases have never been wanting: and,\nin necessary connexion with this fact, there has always been a sympathy\nin this pure moral taste,--an appreciation which could not but help its\ndiffusion. Thence arose the formation of communities for the fostering\nof holiness,--projects which, however mistaken in their methods and\ninjurious in their consequences, have always commanded, and do still\ncommand, sympathy, from the venerableness of their origin. Not all the\nstories of the abuses of monastic institutions can destroy the respect\nof every ingenuous mind for the spiritual preferences out of which they\narose. The Crusades are still holy, notwithstanding all their\ndefilements of vain-glory, superstition, and barbarism of various kinds.\nThe retreat of the Pilgrim Fathers to the forests of the New World\nsilences the ridicule of the thoughtless about the extravagances of\nPuritanism in England.\n\nThus far has the race advanced; and, having thus advanced, there is\nreason to anticipate that the age may come when the individual worship\nof spiritual supremacy may expand into national; when a people may agree\nto govern one another with the smallest possible application of physical\nforce; when goodness shall come to be naturally more honoured than\nbirth, wealth, or even intellect; when ambition of territory shall be\ngiven up; when all thought of war shall be over; when the pursuit of the\nnecessaries and luxuries of external life shall be regarded as means to\nan end; and when the common aim of exertion shall be self and mutual\nperfection. It does not seem to be rash to anticipate such a state of\nhuman affairs as this, when an aspiration like the following has been\nreceived with sympathy by thousands of republicans united under a\nconstitution of ideas. \"Talent and worth are the only eternal grounds of\ndistinction. To these the Almighty has affixed his everlasting patent of\nnobility; and these it is which make the bright, 'the immortal names,'\nto which our children may aspire, as well as others. It will be our own\nfault if, in our land, society as well as government is not organized on\na new foundation.\"--\"Knowledge and goodness,--these make degrees in\nheaven, and they must be the graduating scale of a true democracy.\"[F]\n\nMeantime, it is the traveller's business to learn what is the species of\nMoral Sentiment which lies deepest in the hearts of the majority of the\npeople.\n\n * * * * *\n\nHe will find no better place of study than the Cemetery,--no more\ninstructive teaching than Monumental Inscriptions. The brief language of\nthe dead will teach him more than the longest discourses of the living.\n\nHe will learn what are the prevalent views of death; and when he knows\nwhat is the common view of death, he knows also what is the aspect of\nlife to no small number;--that is, he will have penetrated into the\ninterior of their morals.--If it should ever be fully determined that\nthe pyramids of Egypt were designed solely as places of sepulture, they\nwill cease to be the mute witness they have been for ages. They will\ntell at least that death was not regarded as the great leveller,--that\nkings and peasants were not to sleep side by side in death, any more\nthan in life. How they contrast with the Moravian burial-grounds, where\nall are laid in rows as they happen to be brought to the grave, and\nwhere memorial is forbidden!--The dead of Constantinople are cast out\nfrom among the living in waste, stillness, and solitude. The cemeteries\nlie beyond the walls, where no hum from the city is heard, and where the\ndark cypresses overhanging the white marble tombs give an air of\nmourning and desolation to the scene. In contrast with these are the\nchurch-yards of English cities, whose dead thus lie in full view of the\nliving; the school-boy trundles his hoop among them, and the news of the\nday is discussed above their place of rest. This fact of where the dead\nare laid is an important one. If out of sight, death and religion may or\nmay not be connected in the general sentiment; if within or near the\nplaces of worship, they certainly are so connected. In the cemeteries of\nPersia, the ashes of the dead are ranged in niches of the walls: in\nEgypt we have the most striking example of affection to the body, shown\nin the extraordinary care to preserve it; while some half-civilized\npeople seem to be satisfied with putting their dead out of sight, by\nsummarily sinking them in water, or hiding them in the sand; and the\nCaffres throw their dead to the hyenas,--impelled to this, however, not\nso much by disregard of the dead, as by a superstitious fear of death\ntaking place in their habitations, which causes them to remove the\ndying, and expose them in this state to beasts of prey. The burial of\nthe dead by the road-side by some of the ancients, seems to have brought\ndeath into the closest relation with life; and when the place chosen is\ntaken in connexion with the inscriptions on the tombs,--words addressed\nto the wayfarer as from him who lies within,--from the pilgrim now at\nrest to the pilgrim still on his way, they give plain indications of the\nviews of death and life entertained by those who placed them.\n\nMuch may be learned from the monumental inscriptions of all nations. The\nfirst epitaph is supposed to be traced back to the year of the world\n2700, when the scholars of Linus, the Theban poet, bewailed their master\nin verses which were inscribed upon his tomb. From that day to this,\nwherever there have been letters, there have been epitaphs; and, where\nletters have been wanting, there have been symbols. Mysterious symbolic\narrangements are traced in the monumental mounds in the interior of the\nAmerican continent, where a race of whom we know nothing else flourished\nbefore the Red man opened his eyes upon the light. One common rule,\ndrawn from a universal sentiment, has presided at the framing of all\nepitaphs for some thousands of years. \"De mortuis nil nisi bonum\" is the\nuniversal agreement of mourners.[G] It follows that epitaphs must\neverywhere indicate what is there considered good.\n\nThe observer must give his attention to this. Among a people \"whose\nmerchants are princes,\" the praise of the departed will be in a\ndifferent strain from that which will be found among a warlike nation,\nor a community of agriculturists. Here one may find monumental homage to\npublic spirit, in the form of active citizenship; there to domestic\nvirtue as the highest honour. The glory of eminent station, of ancient\nfamily, of warlike deeds, and of courtly privileges may be conspicuously\nexhibited in one district; while in another the dead are honoured in\nproportion to their contempt of human greatness, even when won by\nachievements; to their having lived with a sole regard \"to things unseen\nand eternal.\" An inscription which breathes the pride of a noble family\nin telling that \"all the sons were brave, and all the daughters chaste,\"\npresents a summary of the morals of the age and class to which it\nbelongs. It tells that the supreme honour of men was to be brave, and of\nwomen to be chaste; excluding the supposition of each sharing the virtue\nof the other: whereas, when courage and purity shall be understood in\ntheir full signification, it will have become essential to the honour of\na noble family that all the sons should be also pure, and all the\ndaughters brave. Then bravery will signify moral rather than physical\ncourage, and purity of mind will be considered no attribute of sex.\n\nEven the nature of the public services commemorated, where public\nservice is considered the highest praise, may indicate much. It is a\nfact of no small significance whether a man is honoured after death for\nhaving made a road, or for having founded a monastery, or endowed a\nschool; whether he introduced a new commodity, or erected a church;\nwhether he marched adventurously in the pursuit of conquest, or fought\nbravely among his native mountains to guard the homes of his countrymen\nfrom aggression. The German, the French, the Swiss monuments of the\npresent century all tell the common tale that men have lived and died:\nbut with what various objects did they live! and in what a variety of\nhope and heroism did they die! All were proud of their respective\ndifferences while they lived; and, now that their contests are at an\nend, they afford materials of speculation to the stranger who ponders\nupon their tombs.\n\nA variety, perhaps a contrariety of praise, may be found in the epitaphs\nof a country, a city, or a single cemetery. Where this diversity is\nfound, it testifies to the diversity of views held, and therefore to the\nfreedom of the prevailing religious sentiment. Everywhere, however,\nthere is an affection and esteem for certain virtues. Disinterestedness,\nfidelity, and love are themes of praise everywhere. Some may have no\nsympathy for the deeds of the warrior, and others for the discoveries of\nthe philosopher and the adventurer; but the honoured parent, the devoted\nchild, the philanthropic citizen, are sure of their tribute from all\nhearts.\n\nEven if there were a variety of praise proportioned to the diversity of\nhearts and minds that utter it, the inscriptions of a cemetery cannot\nbut breathe a spirit which must animate, more or less, the morals of the\nsociety. For instance, the cemetery of Père la Chaise utters, from end\nto end, one wail. It is all mourning, and no hope. Every expression of\ngrief, from tender regret to blank despair, is to be found there; but\nnot a hint of consolation, except from memory. All is over, and the\nfuture is vacant. A remarkable contrast to this is seen in the cemetery\nof Mount Auburn, Massachusetts. The religious spirit of New England is\nthat which has hope for one of its largest elements, and which was\nbelieved by the Puritan fathers to forbid the expression of sorrow. One\nof those fathers made an entry in his journal, in the early days of the\ncolony, that it had pleased God to take from him by an accident his\nbeloved son Henry, whom he committed to the Lord's mercy;--and this was\nall. In a similar spirit are the epitaphs at Mount Auburn framed. There\nis a religious silence about the sorrows of the living, and every\nexpression of joy, thanksgiving, and hope for the dead. One who had\nnever heard of death, might take this for the seed-field of life; for\nthe oratory of the happy; for the heaven of the hopeful. Parents invite\ntheir children from the grave to follow them. Children remind their\nparents that the term of separation will be short; and all repose their\nhopes together on an authority which is to them as stable and\ncomprehensive as the blue sky which is over all.--What a contrast is\nhere! and how eloquent as to the moral views of the respective nations!\nThere is not a domestic attachment or social relation which is not\nnecessarily modified, elevated, or depressed by the conviction of its\nbeing transient or immortal,--an end or means to a higher end. Though\nhuman hearts are so far alike as that there must be a hope of reunion,\nmore or less defined and assured, in all who love, and a practical\nfalling below the elevation of this hope in those even who enjoy the\nstrongest assurance,--yet the moral notions of any society must be very\ndifferent where the ground of hope is taken for granted, and where it is\nkept wholly out of sight.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThe observer may obtain further light upon the moral ideas of a people\nby noting the degree of their Attachment to Kindred and Birth-place.\nThis species of attachment is so natural, that none are absolutely\nwithout it; but it varies in degree, according as the moral taste of the\npeople goes to enhance or to subdue it. The Swiss and the American\nparent both send their children abroad; but with what different feelings\nand views! The Swiss father dismisses his daughter to teach in a school\nat Paris or London, and his sons to commerce or war. He resigns himself\nto a hard necessity, and supports them with suggestions of the honour of\nvirtuous independence, and of the delight of returning when it is\nachieved. They, in their exile, can never see a purple shade upon a\nmountain side, a gleaming sheet of water, or a nestling village, without\na throb of the heart, and a sickening longing for home.--The New\nEngland mother, with her tribe of children around her on her hill-side\nfarm, nourishes them with tales of the noble extent of their\ncountry,--how its boundary is ever shifting westwards, and what a wild\nlife it is there in the forest, with the Red men for neighbours, and\ninexhaustible wealth in the soil, ready for the hand which shall have\nenterprise to work for it. She tells of one and another, but lately boys\nlike her children, who are now judges and legislators,--founders of\ntowns, or having counties named after them. As her young people grow up,\nthey part off eagerly from the old farm,--one into a southern city,\nanother into the western forest, a third to a prairie in a new\nterritory; and the daughters marry, and go over the mountains too. The\nmother may have sighs to conceal, but she does conceal them; and the\nsons, so far from lingering,--are impatient till they are gone. Their\nidea of national honour,--both their patriotic and their personal\nambition,--is concerned; and they welcome the hour of dispersion as the\nfirst step towards the great objects of their life. Some return to the\nold neighbourhood to take a wife; but they do not think of passing their\nsecond childhood where they spent their first,--any more than the Greek\ncolonists who swarmed from their narrow native districts. The settlers\nof the west go there, not to obtain a certain amount of personal\nproperty, but land, station, and power.--How different again are the\nScotch--the people of the strongest family attachments! In the modified\nand elevated feudalism of clanship, pride and love of kindred constitute\nthe animating social principle. Their clan-music is to them what the\nRanz de Vaches is to the Swiss: the one echoing the harmonics of social\nintercourses, as the other revives the melodies of mountain life.\nThrough the love of kindred, the love of birth-place flourishes among\nthe Scotch. The Highland emigrants in Canada not only clasp hands when\nthey hear played the march of their clan, but wept when they found that\nheather would not grow in their newly-adopted soil.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThe traveller must talk with Old People, and see what is the character\nof the garrulity of age. He must talk with Children, and mark the\ncharacter of the aspirations of childhood. He will thus learn what is\ngood in the eyes of those who have passed through the society he\nstudies, and in the hopes of those who have yet to enter upon it. Is it\nthe aged mother's pride that her sons are all unstained in honour, and\nher daughters safe in happy homes? or does she boast that one is a\npriest, and another a peeress? Does the grandmother relate that all her\ndescendants who are of age are \"received church-members\"? or that her\nfavourite grandchild has been noticed by the emperor? Do the old men\nprose of a single happy love, or of exploits of gallantry? or of\ncommercial success, or of political failure? What is the section of life\nto which the greatest number of ancient memories cling? Is it to\nstruggles for a prince in disguise, or to a revolutionary conflict? Is\nit to the removal of a social oppression, or to a season of domestic\ntrial, or to an accession of personal consequence? Is it the having\nacquired an office or a title? or the having assisted in the abolition\nof slavery? or the having conversed with a great author? or the having\nreceived a nod from a prince, or a curtsey from a queen? or have you to\nlisten to details of the year of the scarcity, or the season of the\nplague?--What are the children's minds full of? The little West Indian\nwill not talk of choosing a profession, any more than the infant\nPortuguese will ask for books. One nation of children will tell of the\nlast saint's day, and another will refer every thing to the emperor.\nElsewhere you will be treated with legends without end; or you will be\ninstructed about bargains and wages; or the boys will ask you why a\nking's son should be king whether the people like him or not; and the\ngirls will whisper something to you about their brother being President\nsome day. As the minds of the young are formed, generally speaking, to\nan adaptation to the objects presented to them, their preference of\nwarlike to commercial, or literary to political honour, is an eloquent\ncircumstance: and so of their sense of greatness in any\ndirection,--whether it be of the physical order, or the intellectual, or\nthe spiritual.\n\n * * * * *\n\nFrom this, the transition is natural to the study of the character of\nthe Pride of each nation. Learn what people glory in, and you learn much\nof both the theory and practice of their morals. All nations, like all\nindividuals, have pride, sooner or later, in one thing or another. It is\na stage through which they have to pass in their moral progression, and\nout of which the most civilized have not yet advanced, nor discerned\nthat they will have to advance, though the passion becomes moderated at\neach remove from barbarism. It is by no means clear that the essential\nabsurdity of each is relieved by its dilution. Hereafter, the most\nmodern pride of the most civilized people may appear as ridiculous in\nits nature as the grossest conceit of utter barbarians now appears to\nus; but, still, the direction taken by the general pride must show what\nclass of objects is held in most esteem.\n\nThe Chinese have no doubt that all other countries are created for the\nbenefit of theirs; they call their own \"the central empire,\" as certain\nphilosophers once called our earth the centre round which everything\nelse was to revolve. They call it the Celestial Empire, of which their\nruler is the Sun: \"they profess to rule barbarians by misrule, like\nbeasts, and not like native subjects.\" Here we have the extreme of\nnational pride, which must involve various moral qualities;--all the bad\nones which are the consequence of ignorance, subservience to domestic\ndespotism, and contempt of the race of man; and the good ones which are\nthe consequence of national seclusion,--cheerful industry, social\ncomplacency, quietness, and order.--The Arab pride bears a resemblance\nto the Chinese, but is somewhat refined and spiritualized. The Arabs\nbelieve that the earth, \"spread out like a bed,\" and upheld by a\ngigantic angel (the angel standing upon a rock, and the rock upon a\nbull, and the bull upon a fish, and the fish floating upon water, and\nthe water upon darkness,)--that the earth, thus upheld, is surrounded by\nthe Circumambient Ocean; that the inhabited part of the earth is to the\nrest but as a tent in the desert; and that in the very centre of this\ninhabited part is--Mecca. Their exclusive faith makes a part of their\nnationality, and their insolence shows itself eminently in their\ndevotions. Their spiritual supremacy is their strong point; and they can\nafford to be somewhat less outwardly contemptuous to the race at large,\nfrom the certainty they have that all will be made plain and\nindisputable at last, when the followers of the Prophet alone will be\nadmitted to bliss, and the punishments of the future world will be\neternal to all but wicked Mahomedans. There will be found among the\nArabs, in accordance with this pride, a strong mutual fidelity; and,\namong the best class of believers, a real devotion and a kindly\ncompassion towards outcasts; while, among lower orders of minds, we may\nexpect to witness the extreme exasperation of vindictiveness, insult,\nand rapacity.--We may pass over the pride of caste in India, of royal\nrace in Africa, and the wild notions of Caribbean and Esquimaux dignity,\nwhich are almost as painful to contemplate as the freaks of pride in\nBedlam. There is quite enough to look upon in the most civilized parts\nof the earth.--The whole national character of the Spaniards might be\ninferred from their particularly notorious pride; the quarterings of\nGerman barons are a popular joke; the French pride of military glory is\nan index to the national morals of France; while, in the United States,\nthe pride of Washington and of territory is oddly combined and\ncontrasted. Nothing can be more indicative of the true moral state of\nthe Americans; they hang between the past and the future, with many of\nthe feudal prepossessions of the past, mingled with the democratic\naspirations which relate to the future. The ambition and pride of\nterritory belong to the first, and their pride in the leader of their\nrevolution to the last: he is their personification of that moral power\nto which they profess allegiance. The consequences of this arbitrary\nunion of two kinds of national pride may be foreseen. The Americans\nunite some of the low qualities of feudalism with some of the highest of\na more equal social organization. Without the first, slavery, cupidity,\nand ostentation could not exist to any great extent; without the others,\nthere could not be the splendid moral conflict which we now see going on\nin opposition to slavery, nor the reverence for man which is the\nloveliest feature of American morals and manners.\n\nFrom the aristocratic pride of the English the stranger might draw\ninferences no less correct. If it is found that there is scarcely a\ngamekeeper or a tradesman among us who is not stiffened with prejudices\nabout rank; that gossips can tell what noblemen pay, and which do not\npay, their tradesmen's bills; that persons who have never seen a lord\ncan furnish all information about the genealogy and intermarriages of\nnoble families; that every class is emulating the manners of the one\nabove it; and that democratic principles are held chiefly in the\nmanufacturing districts, or, if in country regions, among the tenantry\nof landlords of liberal politics;--the moral condition of such a people\nlies, as it were, mapped out beneath the eye of the observer. They must\nbe orderly, eminently industrious, munificent in their grants to rulers,\nand mechanically oppressive to the lowest class of the ruled; nationally\ncomplacent, while wanting in individual self-respect; reverentially\ninclined towards the lofty minority, and contemptuously disposed\ntowards the lowly majority of their race; a generous devotion being\nadvantageously mingled, however, with the select reverence, and a kindly\nspirit of protection with the gross contempt. Such, to the eye of an\nobserver, are the qualities involved in English pride. Upon this moral\nmaterial, everywhere diffused, should the traveller observe and reflect.\n\n * * * * *\n\nMan-worship is as universal a practice as that of the higher sort of\nreligion. As men everywhere adore some supposed agents of unseen things,\nthey are, in like manner, disposed to do homage to what is venerable\nwhen it is presented to their eyes in the actions of a living man. This\nman-worship is one of the most honourable and one of the most hopeful\ncircumstances in the mind of the race. An individual here and there may\nscoff at the credulity of others, and profess unbelief in human virtue;\nbut no society has ever yet wanted faith in man. Every community has its\nsaints, its heroes, its sages,--whose tombs are visited, whose deeds are\ncelebrated, whose words have become the rules by which men live.\n\nNow, the moral taste of a people is nowhere more clearly shown than in\nits choice of idols. Of these idols there are two kinds;--those whose\ndivinity is confirmed by the lapse of time, like Gustavus Adolphus among\nthe Swedes, Tell in Switzerland, Henri IV. among the French, and\nWashington among the Americans; and those who are still living, and upon\nwhose daily doings a multitude of eyes are fixed.\n\nThose of the first class reign singly; their uncontested sway is over\nnational character, as well as the affections of individual minds; and\nfrom their character may that of the whole people be, in certain\nrespects, inferred. Who supposes that the Swiss would have been the same\nas they are, if Tell's character and deeds could have been hidden in\noblivion from the moment those deeds were done? What would the Americans\nhave been now if every impression of Washington could have been effaced\nfrom their minds fifty years ago? This is not the place in which to\nenlarge on the power--the greatest power we know of--which man exercises\nover men through their affections; but it is a fact which the observer\nshould keep ever in view. The existence of a great man is one of those\ngigantic circumstances,--one of those national influences,--which have\nbefore been mentioned as modifying the conscience--the feelings about\nright and wrong--in a whole people. The pursuits of a nation for ever\nmay be determined by the fact of the great man of five centuries being a\npoet, a warrior, a statesman, or a maritime adventurer. The morals of a\nnation are influenced to all eternity by the great man's being ambitious\nor moderate, passionate or philosophical, licentious or self-governed.\nCertain lofty qualities he must have, or he could not have attained\ngreatness,--energy, perseverance, faith, and consequently earnestness.\nThese are essential to his immortality; upon the others depends the\nquality of his influence; and upon these must the observer of the\npresent generation reflect.\n\nIt is not by dogmas that Christianity has permanently influenced the\nmind of Christendom. No creeds are answerable for the moral revolution\nby which physical has been made to succumb to moral force; by which\nunfortunates are cherished by virtue of their misfortunes; by which the\npursuit of speculative truth has become an object worthy of\nself-sacrifice. It is the character of Jesus of Nazareth which has\nwrought to these purposes. Notwithstanding all the obscuration and\ndefilement which that character has sustained from superstition and\nother corruption, it has availed to these purposes, and must prevail\nmore and more now that it is no longer possible to misrepresent his\nsayings and conceal his deeds, as was done in the dark ages. In all\nadvancing time, as corruption is surmounted, there are more and more who\nvividly feel that life does not consist in the abundance that a man\npossesses, but in energy of spirit, and in a power and habit of\nself-sacrifice: there are perpetually more and more who discern and live\nby the persuasion that the pursuit of worldly power and ease is a matter\ntotally apart from the function of Christianity; and this persuasion has\nnot been wrought into activity by declarations of doctrine in any form,\nbut by the spectacle, vivid before the eye of the mind, of the Holy One\nwho declined the sword and the crown, lived without property, and\ndevoted himself to die by violence, in an unparalleled simplicity of\nduty. The being himself is the mover here; and every great man is, in a\nsimilar manner, however inferior may be the degree, a spring by which\nspirits are moved. By the study of them may much of the consequent\nmovement be understood. The observer of British morals should gather up\nthe names of their idols; he will hear of Hampden, Bacon, Shakspeare,\nNewton, Howard, and Wesley. In Scotland, he will hear of Bruce and\nKnox. What a flood of light do these names shed on our _morale_! It is\nthe same with the Englishman abroad when his attention is referred in\nFrance to Henri IV, Richelieu, Turenne, and Napoleon, to Bossuet and\nFenelon, to Voltaire, and their glorious list of natural philosophers:\nin Italy, to Lorenzo de' Medici, Galileo, and their constellations of\npoets and artists: in Germany, to Charles V, Luther, Schwartz, Göthe,\nCopernicus, Handel, and Mozart. There is in every nation a succession of\nthroned gods, each of whom is the creator of some region of the national\nmind, and has formed men into more or less of his own likeness.\n\nThe other kind of idols are those who are still living, and whose\ninfluence upon morals and manners is strong, but may or may not be\ndistinguishably permanent. These afford a less faithful evidence,--but\nyet an evidence which is not to be neglected. The spirit of the times is\nseen in the character of the idols of the day, however the nation may be\ndivided in its choice of idols, and however many sects there may be in\nthe man-worship of the generation. In our own day, for instance, how\nplainly is the movement of society discerned, from the fact of the\neminence of philanthropists in many countries! Whether they presently\nsink, or continue to rise, they testify to a prevailing feeling in\nsociety. Père Enfantin in France, Wilberforce in England, Garrison in\nAmerica,--these are watchmen set on a pinnacle (whoever may object to\ntheir being there) who can tell us \"what of the night,\" and how a new\nmorning is breaking. Whether they may be most cause or effect, whether\nthey have more or less decidedly originated the interest of which they\nare the head, it is clear that there is a certain adaptation between\nthemselves and the general mind, without which they could not have risen\nto be what they are.--Every society has always its idols. If there are\nnone by merit, at any moment, station is received as a qualification.\nLarge numbers are always worshipping the heads of the aristocracy, of\nwhatever kind they may be; and there is rarely a long interval in which\nthere is not some warrior, some poet, artist, or philanthropist on whom\nthe multitude are flinging crowns and incense. The popularity of Byron\ntestified to the existence of a gloomy discontent in a multitude of\nminds, as the adoration of De Béranger discloses the political feelings\nof the French. Statesmen rarely command an overwhelming majority of\nworshippers, because interest enters much more than sentiment into\npolitics: but every author, or other artist who can reach the general\nmind,--every preacher, philanthropist, soldier, or discoverer, who has\nrisen into an atmosphere of worship in pursuit of a purpose, is a fresh\nPeter the Hermit, meeting and stimulating the spirit of his time, and\nexhibiting its temper to the observer,--foreign as to either clime or\ncentury. The physical observer of a new region might as well shut his\neyes to the mountains, and omit to note which way the streams run, as\nthe moral observer pass by the idols of a nation with a heedless gaze.\n\n * * * * *\n\nSide by side with this lies the inquiry into the great Epochs of the\nsociety visited. Find out what individuals and nations date from, and\nyou discover what events are most interesting to them. A child reckons\nfrom his first journey, or his entrance upon school: a man from his\nmarriage, his beginning practice in his profession, or forming a fresh\npartnership in trade; if he be a farmer, from the year of a good or bad\ncrop; if he be a merchant, from the season of a currency pressure; if he\nbe an operative, from the winter of the Strike: a matron dates from the\nbirth of her children; her nursemaid from her change of place. Nations,\ntoo, date from what interests them most. It is important to learn what\nthis is. The major date of American citizens is the Revolution; their\nminor dates are elections, and new admissions into the Union. The people\nat Amsterdam date from the completion of the Stadt Huis; the Spaniards\nfrom the achievement of Columbus; the Germans from the deed of Luther;\nthe Haytians from the abduction of Toussaint L'Ouverture; the Cherokees\nfrom treaties with the Whites; the people of Pitcairn's Island from the\nmutiny of the Bounty; the Turks, at present, from the massacre of the\nJanissaries; the Russians from the founding of St. Petersburgh and the\ndeaths of its monarchs; the Irish (for nearer times than the battle of\nthe Boyne) by the year of the fever, the year of the rebellion, the year\nof the famine. There is a world of instruction in this kind of fact; and\nif a new species of epoch, of which there is a promise, should\narise,--if the highest works of men should come to be looked upon as the\nclearest operations of Providence,--if Germany or Europe should date\nfrom Göthe as the civilized world does from Columbus,--this sole test\nmight reveal almost the entire moral state of society.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThe treatment of the Guilty is all-important as an index to the moral\nnotions of a society. This class of facts will hereafter yield\ninfallible inferences as to the principles and views of governments and\npeople upon vice, its causes and remedies. At present, such facts must\nbe used with great caution, because the societies of civilized countries\nare in a state of transition from the old vindictiveness to a purer\nmoral philosophy. The ancient methods, utterly disgraceful as they are,\nmust subsist till society has fully agreed upon and prepared for better\nones; and it would be harsh to pronounce upon the humanity of the\nEnglish from their prisons, or the justice of the French from their\ngalley system. The degrees of reliance upon brute force and upon public\nopinion are yet by no means proportioned to the civilization of\nrespective societies, as at first sight might be expected, and as must\nbe before punishments and prisons can be taken as indications of morals\nand manners.\n\nThe treatment of the guilty in savage lands, and also in countries under\na despotism, indicates the morals of rulers only,--except in so far as\nit points out the political subservience of the people. It is true that\nthe Burmese must needs be in a deplorable social state, if their king\ncan \"spread out\" his prime minister in the sun, as formerly described:\nbut the mercy or cruelty of his subjects can be inferred only from the\nliberty they may have and may use to treat one another in the same\nmanner. In their case, we see that such a power is possessed and put to\nuse. The creditor exposes his debtor's wife, children, and slaves, to\nthe same noon-day sun which broils the prime minister. In Austria, it\nwould be harsh to suppose that subjects have any desire to treat one\nanother as the Emperor and his minister treat political offenders within\nthe walls of the castle of Spielburg. The Russians at large are not to\nbe made answerable for the transportation of coffles of nobles and\ngentlemen to the silver mines of Siberia, and the regiments on the\nfrontier. It is only under a representative government that prisons, and\nthe treatment of criminals under the law, can be fairly considered a\ntest of the feelings of the majority.\n\nIt is too true, however, that punishments are almost everywhere\nvindictive in their character; and have more relation to some supposed\nprinciple of \"not letting vice go unpunished,\" than either to the\nsecurity of society, or the reformation of the offender. The few\nexceptions that exist are a far more conclusive testimony to an\nadvancing state of morals than the old methods are to the vindictiveness\nof the mind of the society which they corrupt and deform. The\nPhiladelphia penitentiary is a proof of the thoughtful and laborious\nhumanity of those who instituted it; but Newgate cannot be regarded as\nthe expressed decision of the English people as to how criminals should\nbe guarded. Such a prison would not now be instituted by any civilized\nnation. Its existence is to be interpreted, not as a token of the\ncruelty and profligacy of the mind of society, but of its ignorance of\nthe case, or of its bigoted adherence to ancient methods, or of its\napathy in regard to improvements to which there is no peremptory call of\nself-interest. Any one of these is enough, Heaven knows, for any\nsociety to have to answer for; enough to yield, by contrast, surpassing\nhonour to the philanthropy which has pulled down the pillory, and is\nlabouring to supersede the hangman, and to convert every prison in the\ncivilized world into an hospital for the cure of moral disease. But the\nreform has begun; the spirit of Howard is on its pilgrimage; and\nbarbarous as is still our treatment of the guilty, better days are in\nprospect.\n\nWhat the traveller has to observe then is, first, whether there has been\nany amelioration of the treatment of criminals in countries where the\npeople have a voice upon it: and, in countries despotically ruled,\nwhether public sentiment is moved about the condition of state\ncriminals, and whether men treat one another vindictively in their\nappeals to the laws of citizenship: whether there is a Burmese cruelty\nin the exercise of the legal rights of the creditor; whether there is a\nreluctance to plunge others into the woes of legal penalties; or whether\noffenders are considered as beyond the pale of sympathy. It may thus\nappear whether the people entertain the pernicious notion that there is\na line drawn for human conduct, on one side of which all is virtue, and\non the other all vice; or whether they are approximating to the more\nphilosophical and genial belief that all wickedness is weakness and woe,\nand that therefore the guilty need more care and tenderness in the\narrangement of the circumstances under which they live than those who\nenjoy greater strength against temptation, and an ease of mind which\ncriminals can never know. In some parts of the United States this\ngeneral persuasion is remarkably evident, and is an incontestable proof\nof the advanced state of morals there. In some prisons of the United\nStates, as much care is bestowed on the arrangements by which the guilty\nare preserved from contaminating one another, are exposed to good\ninfluences and precluded from bad, as in any infirmary on the\nventilation of the wards, and the diet and nursing of the sick. In such\na region, vindictiveness in social punishments must be going out, and\nChrist-like views of human guilt and infirmity beginning to prevail.\n\nThe same conclusions may be drawn from an observation of the methods of\nlegal punishment. Recklessness of human life is one of the surest\nsymptoms of barbarism, whether life is taken by law or by assassination.\nAs men grow civilized, and learn to rate the spiritual higher and higher\nabove the physical life, human life grows sacred. The Turk orders off\nthe head of a slave almost without a serious thought. The New Zealanders\nhave murdered men by scores, to supply their dried and grinning heads to\nEnglish purchasers, who little imagined the cost at which they were\nobtained. This is the way in which life is squandered in savage\nsocieties. Up to a comparatively high point of civilization, the law\nmakes free with life, long after the private expenditure of it has been\nchecked or has ceased. Duels, brawls, assassinations, have nearly been\ndiscontinued, and even war in some measure discountenanced, before the\nlaw duly recognises the sacredness of human life. But the time comes.\nOne generation after another grows up with a still improving sense of\nthe majesty of life,--of the mystery of the existence of such a being as\nman,--of the infinity of ideas and emotions in the mind of each, and of\nthe boundlessness of his social relations. These recognitions may not be\nexpress; but they are sufficiently real to hold back the hand from\nquenching life. The reluctance to destroy such a creation is found to be\non the increase. Men prefer suffering wrong to being accessary to so\nfearful an act as what now appears a judicial murder: the law is left\nunused,--is evaded,--and it becomes necessary to alter it. Capital\npunishments are restricted,--are further restricted,--are abolished.\nSuch is the process. It is now all but completed in the United States:\nit is advancing rapidly in England. During its progress further light is\nthrown on the moral notions of a represented people by a change in the\ncharacter of other (called inferior) punishments. Bodily torments and\ndisfigurements go out. Torture and mutilation are discontinued, and\nafter a while the grosser mental inflictions. The pillory (as mere\nignominious exposure) was a great advance upon the maiming with which it\nwas once connected; but it is now discontinued as barbarous. All\nignominious exposure will ere long be considered equally\nbarbarous,--including capital punishment, of which such exposure is the\nrecommendatory principle. To refer once more to the Pennsylvania\ncase,--these notions of ignominious exposure are there so far outgrown,\nthat avoidance of it is the main principle of the management. Seclusion,\nunder the guardianship of the law, is there the method,--on the\nprinciple of consideration to the weak, and of supreme regard to the\nfeeling of self-respect in the offender,--the feeling in which he is\nnecessarily most deficient. When we consider the brutalizing methods of\npunishment in use in former times, and now in some foreign countries,\nin contrast with the latest instituted and most successful, we cannot\navoid perceiving that such are indications of the moral notions of those\nat whose will they exist, be they a council of despots, or an\nassociation of nations. We cannot avoid perceiving from them what\nbarbarism is held to be justice in some ages and countries; and how that\nwhich would then and there be condemned as culpable leniency, comes\nelsewhere to be considered less than justice. The treatment of the\nguilty is one of the strongest evidences as to the general moral notions\nof society, when it is evidence at all; that is, when the guilty are in\nthe hands of society.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThere is another species of evidence of which travellers are not in the\nhabit of making use, but which is well worth their attention,--the\nConversation of convicted Criminals. There are not many places in the\nworld where it is possible to obtain this, without a greater sacrifice\nof comfort than the ordinary tourist is disposed to make. There is\nlittle temptation to enter prisons where squalid wretches are crowded\ntogether in dirt, noise, and utter profligacy; where no one of them\ncould speak seriously for fear of the ridicule of his comrades; where\nthe father sees his young son corrupted before his eyes, and the mother\nutters cruel jests upon the frightened child that hides its face in her\napron. In scenes like these, there is nothing for the stranger to do and\nto learn. The whole is one great falsehood, where the people are acting\nfalsely under false circumstances. It affords an enterprise for the\nphilanthropist, but no real knowledge for the observer. He may pass by\nsuch places, knowing that they are pretty much alike in all countries\nwhere they exist. Criminals herded together in virtue of their\ncriminality, and outraged into a diabolical hardihood, must present one\nuniform aspect of disgust. What variety should there be in them? About\nas much as in the leper settlements in the wildernesses of the world two\nthousand years ago.\n\nThe traveller will not be permitted to see the state prisoners of any\ndespotic government; but wherever the subject of prison reform has been\nentertained, (and Howard's spirit is at work in many countries of the\nworld,) there will probably be opportunity to converse with offenders in\na better way than by singling them out from the crowd, in a spirit of\ncondescension, and asking them a few questions, in the answers to which\nyou can place no confidence. If you can converse face to face with a\nconvict, as man with man, you can hardly fail to be instructed. If he\nhas been long deprived of equal conversation, his heart will be full;\nhis disposition will be to trust you; his impulse will be to confide to\nyou his offence, and all the details connected with it. By thus\nconversing with a variety of offenders, you will be put in possession of\nthe causes of crime, of the views of society upon the relative gravity\nof offences, and of the condition of hope or despair in which those are\nleft who have broken the laws, and are delivered over to shame.\n\nMuch light will also be thrown upon the seat of the disorders of\nsociety. Putting political offences aside, as varying in number in\nproportion to the nature of the government, almost all the rest are\noffences against property. Nine out of ten convicts, perhaps, are\npunished for taking the money or money's worth of another. Here is a\nhint as to the respects in which society is most mistaken in its\nprinciples, and weakest in its organization. Of the offences against the\nperson, some are occasioned by the bad habits which attend the practice\nof depredation on property; thieves are drunkards, and drunkards are\nbrawlers:--but the greater number arise out of domestic miseries. Where\nthere are fewest assaults occasioned by conjugal injuries and domestic\ntroubles, the state of morals is the purest. Where they abound, it is\nclear that the course of love does not run smooth; and that, from the\nworkings of some bad principles, domestic morals are in a low state. In\nAustria and Prussia, state criminals abound; while in America such a\nthing is rarely heard of. In America, a youthful and thriving country,\noffences against property for the most part arise out of bad personal\nhabits, which again are occasioned by domestic misery of some kind; this\ndomestic misery, however, being itself less common than in an older\nstate of society. In England almost all the offences are against\nproperty, and are so multitudinous as to warrant a stranger's conclusion\nthat the distribution of property among us must be extremely faulty, the\noppression of certain classes by others very severe, and our political\nmorals very low; in short, that the aristocratic spirit rules in\nEngland. From the tales of convicts,--how they were reared, what was the\nnature of the snares into which they fell, what opportunity of\nretrieving themselves remained, and what was the character of the\ninfluences which sank them into misery,--much cannot but be learned of\nthe moral atmosphere in which they were reared. From their present state\nof mind,--whether they revert in affection to their homes, or to the\nsociety from which they have been snatched,--whether they look forward\nwith hope or fear, or are incapable of looking forward at all,--it will\nappear whether the justice and benevolence of the community have secured\nthe commonest blessings of moral life to these its lowest members, or\nwhether they have been utterly crushed by the selfishness of the society\ninto which they were born. To have criminals at all may in time come to\nbe a disgrace to a community; meantime, their number and quality are an\nevidence as to its prevalent moral notions, which the intelligent\nobserver will not disregard.\n\n * * * * *\n\n[H]\"The SONGS of every nation must always be the most familiar and truly\npopular part of its poetry. They are uniformly the first fruits of the\nfancy and feeling of rude societies; and, even in the most civilized\ntimes, are _the only_ poetry of the great body of the people. Their\ninfluence, therefore, upon the character of a country has been\nuniversally felt and acknowledged. Among rude tribes, it is evident that\ntheir songs must, at first, take their tone from the prevailing\ncharacter of the people. But, even among them, it is to be observed\nthat, though generally expressive of the fiercest passions, they yet\nrepresent them with some tincture of generosity and good feeling, and\nmay be regarded as the first lessons and memorials of savage virtue. An\nIndian warrior, at the stake of torture, exults, in wild numbers, over\nthe enemies who have fallen by his tomahawk, and rejoices in the\nanticipated vengeance of his tribe. But it is chiefly by giving\nexpression to the loftiest sentiments of invincible courage and\nfortitude, that he seeks to support himself in the midst of his\ntorments. 'I am brave and intrepid!' he exclaims,--'I do not fear death\nnor any kind of torture! He who fears them is a coward--he is less than\na woman. Death is nothing to him who has courage!' As it is thus the\nvery best parts of their actual character that are dwelt upon even in\nthe barbarous songs of savages, these songs must contribute essentially\nto the progress of refinement, by fostering and cherishing every germ of\ngood feeling that is successively developed during the advancement of\nsociety. When selfishness begins to give way to generosity,--when mere\nanimal courage is in some degree ennobled by feelings of patriotic\nself-devotion,--and, above all, when sensual appetite begins to be\npurified into love,--it is then that the popular songs, by acquiring a\nhigher character themselves, come to produce a still more powerful\nreaction upon the character of the people. These songs, produced by the\nmost highly-gifted of the tribe,--by those who feel most strongly, and\nexpress their feelings most happily,--convey ideas of greater elevation\nand refinement than are as yet familiar; but not so far removed from the\nordinary habits of thinking as to be unintelligible. The hero who\ndevotes himself to death for the safety of his country, with a firmness\nas yet almost without example in the actual history of the race,--and\nthe lover, who follows his mistress through every danger, and perhaps\ndies for her sake,--become objects on which every one delights to dwell,\nand models which the braver and nobler spirits are thus incited to\nemulate. The songs of rude nations, accordingly, and those in which they\ntake most pleasure, are filled with the most romantic instances of\ncourage, fidelity, and generosity; and it cannot be supposed that such\ndelightful and elevating pictures of human nature can be constantly\nbefore the eyes of any people, without producing a great effect on their\ncharacter. The same considerations are applicable to the effects of\npopular ballads upon the most numerous classes of society, even in\ncivilized nations.\"\n\nIt appears that popular songs are both the cause and effect of general\nmorals: that they are first formed, and then react. In both points of\nview they serve as an index of popular morals. The ballads of a people\npresent us, not only with vivid pictures of the common objects which are\nbefore their eyes,--given with more familiarity than would suit any\nother style of composition,--but they present also the most prevalent\nfeelings on subjects of the highest popular interest. If it were not so,\nthey would not have been popular songs. The traveller cannot be wrong in\nconcluding that he sees a faithful reflection of the mind of a people in\ntheir ballads. When he possesses the popular songs of former centuries,\nhe holds the means of transporting himself back to the scenes of the\nancient world, and finds himself a spectator of its most active\nproceedings. Wars are waged beneath his eye, and the events of the chase\ngrow to a grandeur which is not dreamed of now. Love, the passion of all\ntimes, and the staple of all songs, varies in its expression among\nevery people and in every age, and appears still another and yet the\nsame. The lady of ballads is always worthy of love and song; but there\nare instructive differences in the treatment she receives. Sometimes she\nis oppressed by a harsh parent; sometimes wrongfully accused by a wicked\nservant, or a false knight; sometimes her soft nature is exasperated\ninto revenge; sometimes she is represented as fallen, but always, in\nthat case, as enduring retribution. Upon the whole, the testimony is\nstrong in favour of bravery in men, and purity in women, and constancy\nin both;--and this in the whole range of popular poetry, from ancient\nArabic effusions, through centuries of European song, up to the Indian\nchants which may yet be heard on the shores of the wide western lakes.\nThe distinguishing attributes of great men bear a strong resemblance,\nfrom the days when all Greece rang with the musical celebration of\nHarmodius and Aristogiton, through the age of Charlemagne, up to the\ntriumphs of Bolivar: and women have been adored for the same qualities,\nhowever variously set forth, from the virgin with gazelle eyes of three\nthousand years ago, to the dames who witnessed the conflicts of the Holy\nLand, and onwards to the squaw who calls upon her husband not to forget\nher in the world of spirits, and to our Burns' Highland Mary.\n\nWhat the traveller has to look to is, that he does not take one aspect\nof the popular mind for the whole, or a temporary state of the popular\nmind for a permanent one,--though, from the powerful action of national\nsong, this temporary state is likely to become a permanent one by its\nmeans. As an instance of the first, the observer would be mistaken in\njudging of more than a class of English from some of the best songs they\nhave,--Dibdin's sea songs. They are too fair a representation of the\nsingle class to which they pertain, though they have done much to foster\nand extend the spirit of generosity, simplicity, activity, gaiety, and\nconstant love, which they breathe. They have undoubtedly raised the\ncharacter of the British navy, and are to a great degree indicative of\nthe naval spirit with us: but they present only one aspect of the\nnational mind. In Spain, again, the songs with which the mountains are\nringing, and whose origin is too remote to be traced, are no picture of\nthe conventional mind of the aristocratic classes. As an instance of the\nfalse conclusions which might be drawn from the popular songs of a brief\nperiod, we may look to the revolutionary poetry of France. It would be\nunfair to judge of the French people by their _ça ira_ or the\n_Carmagnole_, however true an expression such songs may be of the spirit\nof the hour. The nation had lived before under \"une monarchie absolue\ntempérée par des chansons;\" the absolutism grew too galling; and then\nthe songs took the tone of fury which protracted oppression had bred. It\nwas not long before the tone was again changed. Napoleon was harassed on\nhis imperial throne by tokens of a secret understanding, unfriendly to\nhis interests: those tokens were songs ambiguously worded, or set to\nairs which were used as signs; and treason, which he could not reach,\nwas perpetually spoken and acted within ear-shot and before his eyes.\nWhen the royal family returned, the songs of De Béranger passed in like\nmanner from lip to lip, and the restored throne trembled to the echo. In\nFrance, morals have for many years found their chief expression in\npolitics; and from the songs of Paris may the traveller learn the\npolitical feelings of the time. Under representative governments, where\npolitics are the chief expression of morals, the songs of the people\ncannot but be an instructive study to the observer; and scarcely less so\nin countries where, politics being forbidden, the domestic and friendly\nrelations must be the topics through which the most general ideas and\nfeelings will flow out.\n\nThe rudest and the most advanced nations abound in songs. They are heard\nunder the plantain throughout Africa, as in the streets of Paris. The\nboatmen on the Nile, and the children of Cairo on their way to school,\ncheer the time with chants; as do the Germans in their vineyards, and in\nthe leisure hours of the university. The Negro sings of what he sees and\nfeels,--the storm coming over the woods, the smile of his wife, and the\ncoolness of the drink she gives him. The Frenchman sings the woes of the\nstate prisoner, and the shrewd self-cautionings of the citizen. The\nsongs of the Egyptian are amatory, and of the German varied as the\naccomplishments of the nation,--but in their moral tone earnest and\npure. The more this mode of expression is looked into, the more\nserviceable it will be found to the traveller's purposes of observation.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThe subject of the Literature of nations, as a means of becoming\nfamiliar with their moral ideas, is too vast to be enlarged on here. The\nconsiderations connected with it are so obvious, too, that the traveller\nto whom they would not occur can be but little qualified for the work\nof observing.\n\nIt is clear that we cannot know the mind of a nation, any more than of\nan individual, by merely looking at it, without hearing any speech.\nNational literature is national speech. By this are its prevalent ideas\nand feelings uttered. It is necessarily so; for books which do not meet\nsympathy from numbers die immediately, and books which strike upon the\nsympathies of all never die. Between the two extremes, of books which\ncommand the sympathies of a class, and those which are the delight of\nall, there is an extensive gradation, from which the careful observer\nmay almost frame for himself a scale of popular morals and manners. I\nmean, of course, in countries where there is a copious classical, or a\ngrowing modern literature. A people which happens to be without a\nliterature,--the Americans, for instance,--must be judged of, as\ncautiously as may be, by such other means of utterance as they may\nhave,--the political institutions which the present generation has\nformed or assented to,--their preferences in selection from the\nliterature of other countries; and so on. But there is a far greater\ndanger of their being misunderstood than there can ever be with regard\nto a nation which speaks for itself through books. \"A country which has\nno national literature,\" writes a student of man, \"or a literature too\ninsignificant to force its way abroad, must always be to its neighbours,\nat least in every important spiritual respect, an unknown and\nmisestimated country. Its towns may figure on our maps; its revenues,\npopulation, manufactures, political connexions, may be recorded in\nstatistical books: but the character of the people has no symbol and no\nvoice; we cannot know them by speech and discourse, but only by mere\nsight and outward observation of their habits and procedure.\"[I]\n\nThe very fact of there being no literature in a nation may, however,\nyield inferences as to its mental and moral state. There is a very\nlimited set of reasons why a people is without speech. They are\nbarbarous, or they are politically oppressed; or the nation is young,\nand busy in providing and securing the means of national existence; or\nit has the same language with another people, and therefore the full\nadvantage of its literature, as if it were not foreign. These seem to be\nnearly all the reasons for national silence; and any one of them affords\nsome means of insight into the morals and manners of the dumb people.\n\nAs for those which have utterance, they either speak freshly from day to\nday, or they show their principles and temper by the choice they make\nfrom among their own classics. Whatever is most accordant with their\nsympathies, they dwell upon; so that the selection is a sure indication\nof what the popular sympathies are. The same may be said of the\ncomparative popularity of modern books; but they may reveal only a\ntemporary state of feeling, and the traveller has to separate this\nspecies of evidence from the more important kind which testifies to the\npermanent affections and convictions of a people. The revelling of the\nFrench in Voltaire, of the Germans in Werter, and of the English in\nByron, was, in each case, a highly important revelation of popular\nfeeling; but it is not a circumstance from which to judge of the fixed\nnational character of any of the three. It was a sign of the times, and\nnot signs of nations. Voltaire pulled down certain erections which could\nnot stand any longer, and was worshipped as a denier of untruths,--the\npopular mind being then ripe for the exploding of errors. But here ended\nthe vocation of Voltaire. The French are now busy, to the extent of\ntheir energy, in doing what ought to follow upon the exposure of\nerrors;--they are searching after truth. Pretences having been\ndestroyed, they are now propounding and trying principles; and works\nwhich propose new and sounder erections find favour in preference to\nsuch as only expose and ridicule old sins and mistakes.--Werter was\npopular because it expressed the universal restlessness and discontent\nunder which not only Germany, but Europe was suffering. Multitudes found\ntheir uncomfortable feelings uttered for them; and Werter was, in fact,\nthe groan of a continent. Old superstitions, tyrannies, and ignorance\nwere becoming intolerable, and no way was seen out of them; and the\nvoice of complaint was hailed with universal sympathy. So it was with\nthe poetry of Byron, adopted and echoed as it was, and will for some\ntime continue to be, by the sufferers under an aristocratic constitution\nof society, whether they be oppressed by force from without, or by\nweariness, satiety, and disgust from within. The permanent state of the\nEnglish mind is not represented in Byron, and could not be guessed at\nfrom his writings, except by inference from the woes of a particular\norder of minds: but his popularity was an admirable sign of the times,\nfor such observers as were capable of interpreting it. Probably, in all\nages since the pen and the press began their work, literature has been\nthe expression of the popular mind; but it seems to have become\npeculiarly forcible, as a general utterance, of late. Whatever truth\nthere may be in speculations about the growing infrequency of \"immortal\nworks,\"--about the age being past for the production of books which\nshall become classics,--it appears that literature is assuming more and\nmore the character of letters written to those whom their subjects may\nconcern, and becoming more and more a familiar utterance of the general\nmind of the day. In the popular modern works of Germany there is deep\nand warm religious sentiment, while the most unflinching examination\ninto the philosophy and fact of revelation is widely encouraged. In\nEngland, there is a growing taste for works which exhibit the life of\nthe lower orders of society, though all aristocratic prepossessions\nappear in practice as strong as ever. This seems to indicate that our\nphilosophy has a democratic tendency under which a general opinion will\nbe formed, which will, in time, be expressed in practice. The French,\nagain, are devouring, at the rate of two new volumes every three days,\nnovels which are, in fact, letters to those whom they may concern on the\ncondition and prospects of men and women in society. The pictures are\nsomething more than mere delineations. They carry with them principles\nby which the position of the members of the community is to be tested.\nThe social position of Woman is a prominent topic. The first principles\nof social organization are involved in the groundwork of the simplest\nstories: and the universal reception of this product of literature shows\nthat those whom it concerns are all. What an enormous loss of knowledge\nmust the traveller sustain who omits to observe and reflect upon the\nspirit of the fresh literature of a people, or of its preferences among\nthe literature of the past!\n\nHe must note whether a people has recent dramatic productions: if not,\nwhether and why the times are unfavourable to that kind of literature;\nand if there is dramatic production, what are the pictures of life that\nit presents.\n\nHe must obtain at least some general idea of what the mental philosophy\nof the society is,--not so much because mental philosophy affects the\nnational mind, as because it emanates from it. Is it a gross material,\nor a refined analytical, or a massy mystical philosophy? The first is\nusually found in the sceptical stage of the mind of a nation; the last\nin its healthy infancy; while the other is rarely to be found at all,\nexcept as the product of an individual mind of a high order. Few\ntravellers will have occasion to give much attention to this part of\ntheir task of observation; as, among all the nations of the earth, there\nis not one in ten that has any mental philosophy at all.\n\nAll have Fiction (other than dramatic); and this must be one of the\nobserver's high points of view. There is no need to spend words upon\nthis proposition. It requires no proof that the popular fictions of a\npeople, representing them in their daily doings and common feelings,\nmust be a mirror of their moral sentiments and convictions, and of their\nsocial habits and manners. The saying this is almost like offering an\nidentical proposition. The traveller should stock his carriage with the\nmost popular fictions, whether of the present day, or of a recent or\nancient time. He should fill up his leisure with them. He should\nseparate what they have that is congenial with his own habit of mind,\nfrom that with which he can least sympathize, and search into the origin\nof the latter. This will be something of a guide to him as to what is\npermanent and universal in the sentiments and convictions of the people,\nand what is to be regarded as a distinctive feature of the particular\nsociety or time.\n\nIt is impossible but that, by the diligent use of these means, the\nobserver must learn much of the general moral notions of the people he\nstudies,--of what they approve and disapprove,--what they eschew and\nwhat they seek,--what they love and hate, desire and fear;--of what, in\nshort, yields them most internal trouble or peace.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nDOMESTIC STATE.\n\n \"How lived, how loved, how died they?\"\n BYRON.\n\nGeologists tell us that they can answer for the modes of life of the\npeople of any extensive district by looking at the geological map of the\nregion. Put a geological map of England before one who understands it,\nand he will tell you that the inhabitants of the western parts, from\nCornwall, through Wales, and up through Cumberland into Scotland, are\nminers and mountaineers; here living in clusters round the shaft of a\nmine, and there sprinkled over the hills, and secluded in the valleys.\nHe will tell you that, on the middle portion of the surface, from\nDevonshire, up through Leicestershire, to the Yorkshire coast, the wide\npastures are covered with flocks, while the people are collected into\nlarge manufacturing towns; an ordinary map showing, at the same time,\nthat Kidderminster, Birmingham, Coventry, Leicester, and Nottingham,\nSheffield, Huddersfield, and Leeds, with many others, lie in this\ndistrict. He will tell you that the third range, comprehending the\neastern part of the island, is studded with farms, and that tillage is\nthe great occupation and interest of the inhabitants.\n\nThe moralist might follow up the observations of the geologist with an\naccount of the general characteristics of societies engaged in these\noccupations. He knows that a distinct intellectual and moral character\nbelongs to miners, to artisans, and to agriculturists; he knows that\nminers are prone to superstition, and to speculation in business, from\nthe incalculable nature of their pursuits, the hap-hazard character of\ntheir enterprises; he knows that an artisan population is active-minded,\ncommunicative, capable and fond of concert; that among them is found the\ngreatest proportion of religious dissent and political sagacity, of\nknowledge and its results in action. He knows that an agricultural\npeople are less of a society than the others; that they are as mentally\nsluggish in comparison with operatives, as they are physically superior\nto them; that they make far less use of speech; are more attached to\nwhat is habitual and ancient, and have less enterprise and desire of\nchange. They are, in fact, the representatives of the past,--of feudal\ntimes; while an artisan population is a prophecy of the future, and the\nbeginning of the fulfilment. The ideas of equal rights, of\nrepresentation of person as well as property, and all other democratic\nnotions, originate in towns, and chiefly in manufacturing towns. Loyalty\nto the person rather than the function of rulers, pride in land and love\nof it as the blessing of blessings, and jealousy of every other\ninterest, are found wherever corn springs up in the furrows, and there\nare farm-houses to be miniature representations of the old feudal\nestablishments.\n\nSuch are the general tendencies, modified according to circumstances.\nThere are influences which make certain artisans in England tories, and\ncertain landlords and tenants liberals; and there may be times and\nplaces where whole societies may have their characteristics modified;\nbut there is rarely or never a complete departure from the general rule.\nLandlords and their posse of tenants, called liberal, soon find a point\nbeyond which they cannot go, and from which they tend back into the\npolitics of their order; and there is often but a single step for tory\nartisans into ultra-radicalism; it turns out to be a spurious toryism.\nSo it is possible that there might have been here and there a democrat\nin La Vendée in 1793, and a sprinkling of royalists in Lyons in 1817.\nYet La Vendée and Linois may be taken as representatives of the two\nkinds of society. The weaving population of Lyons are, like that of\nmanufacturing towns generally, disposed to irritability by physical\nuneasiness, nourishing their ideas and feelings by communication,\nsuffering from the consequences of partial knowledge, having glimpses of\na better social state, and laying the blame of their adversities on a\ndeficiency of protection by the government; enterprising and nicely\nskilled in the improvement of their articles of manufacture, and ever\nfull of aspiration. The inhabitants of La Vendée are so diametrically\nopposite in their social circumstances and characteristics, that their\nbias in politics is a matter of course. Here is a description of the\nface of the district at the time that Lyons was as intensely republican\nas La Vendée was royalist:--\n\n\"Only two great roads traversed this sequestered region, running nearly\nparallel, at a distance of more than seventy miles from each other. The\ncountry, though rather thickly peopled, contained, as may be supposed,\nfew large towns; and the inhabitants, devoted almost entirely to rural\noccupations, enjoyed a great deal of leisure. The noblesse or gentry of\nthe country were very generally resident on their estates, where they\nlived in a style of simplicity and homeliness which had long disappeared\nfrom every other part of the kingdom. No grand parks, fine gardens, or\nornamented villas; but spacious clumsy chateaux, surrounded with farm\noffices, and cottages for the labourers. Their manners and way of life,\ntoo, partook of the same primitive rusticity. There was great\ncordiality, and even much familiarity, in the intercourse of the\nseigneurs with their dependants: they were followed by large trains of\nthem in their hunting expeditions, which occupied so great a part of\ntheir time. Every man had his fowling-piece, and was a marksman of fame\nor pretensions. The peasants resorted familiarly to their landlords for\nadvice, both legal and medical; and they repaid the visits in their\ndaily rambles, and entered with interest into all the details of their\nagricultural operations. From all this there resulted a certain\ninnocence and kindliness of character, joined with great hardihood and\ngaiety. Though not very well educated, the population were exceedingly\ndevout; though theirs was a kind of superstitious and traditional\ndevotion, it must be owned, rather than an enlightened or rational\nfaith. They had the greatest veneration for crucifixes and images of\ntheir saints, and had no idea of any duty more imperious than that of\nattending on all the solemnities of religion. They were singularly\nattached also to their curés, who were almost all born and bred in the\ncountry, spoke their _patois_, and shared in all their pastimes and\noccupations. When a hunting-match was to take place, the clergyman\nannounced it from the pulpit after prayers, and then took his\nfowling-piece and accompanied his congregation to the thicket.\"[J]\n\nThe chief contrasting features of these two kinds of society may be\nrecognized in all parts of the civilized world. The most intensely loyal\nof the loyal Chinese will be found irrigating the terraces of the\nmountains, or busy in the ploughing-matches of the plains; and the least\ncontented will be found at the loom. Spain is removed from a capacity\nfor social freedom just in proportion to the discouragement of\nmanufactures. The vine-growing districts of Germany are the most, and\nthe commercial towns the least, acquiescent in the rule under which they\nare living. Russia will be despotically governed as long as she has no\nmanufactures; and England and the United States are rescued, by the full\nestablishment of their manufactures, from all danger of a retrogradation\ntowards feudalism.\n\nThe way in which these considerations concern us in this place is, that\npublic and private morals, no less than manners, depend on the degree of\nfeudalism which is left in the community. We have spoken before of the\nmorals of the feudal and democratic states of society; and what we are\nnow pointing out is, that these states, with their attendant morals and\nmanners, may be discerned from the face of the country, and the\nconsequent occupations of its inhabitants.\n\nIt appears as if a geological map might be a useful guide to the\nresearches of the moralist,--an idea which would have appeared insanely\nridiculous half a century ago, but now reasonable enough. If the\ntraveller be no geologist, so that he cannot, by his own observation,\ndetermine the nature of the soil, and thence infer, for his general\nguidance, the employments and mental and moral state of the people, he\nmust observe the face of the country along the road he travels. He will\ndo better still by mounting any eminences which may be within reach,\nwhether they be churches, pillars, pyramids, pagodas, baronial castles\non rocks, or peaks of mountains; thence he should look abroad, from\npoint to point, through the whole region, and mark out what he sees\nspread beneath him. Are there pastures extended to the horizon, with\nherdsmen and flocks sprinkled over them, and in the midst a cloud of\nsmoke overhanging a town, from which roads part off in many directions?\nOr is it a scene of shadowy mountains, with streams leaping from their\nfissures, and no signs of human habitation but the machinery of a mine,\nwith rows of dwellings near heaps of piled rubbish? Or is the whole\nintersected with fences, and here dark with fallows, there yellow with\ncorn, while farmsteads terminate the lanes, and the dwellings and\ngrounds of rich proprietors are seen at intervals, with each a hamlet\nresting against its boundaries? Is this the kind of scene, whether the\ngreat house be called mansion, or chateau, or villa, or schloss; whether\nthe produce be corn, or grapes, or tea, or cotton? A person gifted with\na precocity of science in the twelfth century might have prophesied what\nis now happening from the picture stretched beneath him as he gazed\nfrom an eminence on the banks of the Don or the Calder. He might see,\nwith the bodily eye, only\n\n \"Meadows trim with daisies pied,\n Shallow brooks and rivers wide,\"\n\nwith clusters of houses in the far distance, and Robin Hood with his\nmerry men lurking in the thickets of the forest, or basking under the\noaks: but with the prophetic eye of science he might discern the\nmultitudes that were, in course of time, to be living in Sheffield or\nHuddersfield; the stimulus that would be given to enterprise, the\nthronging of merchants to this region, the physical sufferings, the\nmoral pressure, that must come; the awakening of intelligence, and the\narousing of ambition. In the real scene, a cloud-shadow might be passing\nover a meadow; in the ideal, a smoke-cloud would be resting upon a\nhundred thousand human beings. In the real scene, a warbling lark might\nbe springing from the grass; in the ideal, a singer[K] of a higher order\nmight appear remonstrating with feudalism from amidst the roar of the\nfurnace-blast and the din of the anvil; and then, when his complaint of\nsocial oppression is done, starting forwards to the end of all, and\nsinging the requiem of the world itself.\n\n \"Whose trade is poaching. Honest Jem works not,\n Begs not; but thrives by plundering beggars here.\n Wise as a lord, and quite as good a shot,\n He, like his betters, lives in hate and fear,\n And feeds on partridge because bread is dear.\n Sire of six sons apprenticed to the jail,\n He prowls in arms, the Tory of the night;\n With them he shares his battles and his ale;\n With him they feel the majesty of might.\"\n \"He reads not, writes not, thinks not; scarcely feels:\n Steals all he gets; serves Hell with all he steals.\"\n\n * * * * *\n\n \"Yes, and the sail-less worlds which navigate\n Th' unutterable deep that hath no shore,\n Will lose their starry splendour soon or late,\n Like tapers quenched by Him whose will is fate!\n Yes, and the angel of Eternity,\n Who numbers worlds and writes their names in light,\n One day, O Earth, will look in vain for thee,\n And start, and stop in his unerring flight;\n And with his wings of sorrow and affright\n Veil his impassioned brow and heavenly tears!\"\n\nSomewhat in the same way as such a supposed philosophic observer might\nbe imagined to foresee that democratic strains of remonstrance would\nhere succeed to foresters' and freebooters' songs, may a well-qualified\nobserver of the present day discern the interior mechanism and the\nremote issues of what lies beneath his eyes. While surveying the vast\nprairies on the banks of the deep rivers of the Western world, he may\nsafely anticipate the time when self-governing communities will swarm\nwhere now a settler's log-house and enclosure are the only break in the\nwide surface of verdure. While looking down upon the harvests of\nVolhynia, or watching the processions of wagons laden with corn, and\nslowly wending their way down to Odessa, he may securely conclude that\nno vivacious artisan population will enliven this region for a long time\nto come; that the inhabitants will continue attached to the despotism\nunder which they live; and that the morals of a despotism--the morals\nwhich coexist with gross ignorance and social subservience--may be\nlooked for and found for at least an age.\n\nSome preparation may thus be made by a glance over the face of the\ncountry. Much depends on whether it is flat or mountainous, pasture or\narable land. It appears from fact, too, that much depends on minor\ncircumstances,--even on whether it is damp or dry. It is amusing to the\ntraveller in Holland to observe how new points of morals spring up out\nof its swamps, as in the East from the dryness of the deserts. To injure\nthe piles on which the city is built, is at Amsterdam a capital offence;\nand no inhabitant could outgrow the shame of tampering with the\nvegetation by which the soil of the dykes is held together. While Irish\nchildren are meritoriously employed in gathering rushes to make candles,\nand sedges for thatch, \"the veriest child in Holland would resent as an\ninjury any suspicion that she had rooted up a sedge or a rush, which had\nbeen planted to strengthen the embankments.\"[L] Such are certain points\nof morals in a country where water is the great enemy. In the East,\nwhere drought is the chief foe, it is a crime to defile or stop up a\nwell, and the greatest of social glories is to have made water flow\nwhere all before was dry. In Holland, a malignant enemy cuts the dyke,\nas the last act of malice: in Arabia, he fills up the wells. In Holland,\na distinct sort of moral feeling seems to have grown up about\nintemperance in drink. The humidity of the climate, and the scarcity of\nclear, wholesome water, obliges the inhabitants to drink much of other\nliquids. If moderation in them were not made a point of conscience of\nthe first importance, the consequences of their prevalent use would be\ndreadful. The success of this particular moral effort is great.\nDrunkenness is almost as rare in Holland as carelessness in keeping\naccounts, and tampering with the dykes. There is no country in the world\nwhose morals have more clearly grown out of its circumstances than\nHolland. On the theory of an infallible Moral Sense, it would be as\ndifficult to account for a Dutchman's tenderness of conscience on any of\nthe above three heads, as for a soldier's agony at the imputation of\nsleeping upon guard, or an Alabama planter's resentment at being charged\nwith putting the alphabet in the way of a mulatto.\n\n * * * * *\n\nHaving noted the aspect of the country, the observer's next business is\nto ascertain the condition of the inhabitants as to the supply of the\nNecessaries of life. He knows that nothing remains to be learned of the\ndomestic morals of people who are plunged in hopeless poverty. There is\nno foundation for good morals among such. They herd together, desperate\nor depressed; they have no prospect; their self-respect is prostrated;\nthey have nothing to lose, there is nothing for them to gain by any\neffort that they can make.--But it is needless to speak of this. When we\ntreat of the domestic morals of any class, it is always presupposed that\nthey are not in circumstances which render total immorality almost\ninevitable.\n\nIn agricultural districts, the condition of the inhabitants may be\nlearned by observation of the markets. An observing traveller has said,\n\"To judge at once of a nation, we have only to throw our eyes on the\nmarkets and the fields. If the markets are well supplied, the fields\nwell cultivated, all is right. If otherwise, we may say, and say truly,\nthese people are barbarous and oppressed.\"[M] This, though a rather\nsweeping judgment, is founded in truth, and is well worthy of being\nborne in mind in travelling. It so happens that the negroes of Hayti are\nabundantly supplied with the necessaries, and with many of the comforts\nof life; that they are by no means barbarous, and far from being\noppressed; and yet they have few roads, and scarcely any markets. They\ngrow up in the midst of plenty; but, when a countryman is about to kill\na hog, he sends his son round among his neighbours on horseback, to give\nnotice to any who wish for pork, to send for it on a certain day. Their\nwretched, barbarous, oppressed countrymen in South Carolina, meanwhile,\nhave excellent markets. The Saturday night's market at Charleston might\nbeguile a careless foreigner into the belief that those who throng it\nare a free and prosperous people. Thus the rule above quoted does not\nalways hold. Yet it is true that the existence and good quality of\nmarkets testify to the existence and good quality of other desirable\nthings.\n\nWhere markets are abundantly and variously supplied, it is clear that\nthere must be a large demand for the comforts of life, and a diversity\nof domestic wants. It is clear that there must be industry to meet this\ndemand, and competence to justify it. There must be social security, or\nthe industry and competence would not be put to so hazardous a use. It\n_may_ happen, as at Charleston, that the capital is the masters' (whose\nthe profits may also be, at any moment); that the industry is called\nforth by a delusive hope; and that the briskness of the transactions at\nmarket is ascribable to the pleasure slaves have in social meetings; but\nbetter things may usually be inferred from a well-supplied and\nwell-conducted market.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThe traveller's other researches in agricultural regions will be into\nthe Tenure of lands,--whether they are held in small separate\nproperties;--whether such properties are held by individuals, or shared\nwith any kind of partners;--whether portions are rented from landlords;\nand, if so, whether any order of middlemen are concerned in the\nbusiness;--whether the land is chiefly held by large owners; and, if so,\nwhether the labourers are attached to the soil under feudal\narrangements, or whether they are free labourers working for wages.\n\nThe homes of the agricultural population will be found to vary in aspect\nas any one of these systems prevails. In young and prosperous countries,\nthe system of small separate properties is found to conduce to\nindependence and the virtues which result from it, though it is not\nfavourable to knowledge and enlightenment. Families live much to\nthemselves; and thus, while forming strong domestic attachments, they\nlose sight of what is going on in the world. They become unused to the\nlight of society, and get to dislike and fear it. The labourers, in such\ncase, usually live with the family, whether they be brothers, as often\nhappens in Switzerland; sons, as in many a farm-house of the United\nStates; or hired servants, as in former times in England,--and still in\nsome retired parts. In each case the picture is easily filled in by the\nimagination. All are engaged, throughout the year, in the business of\nliving. The work is never ending, still beginning; or, if it has\nintervals, they are dull and weary, from the absence of interests\nwherewith to occupy them. The employments of life are innocent, and the\nprinciple of association is harmless; but if there be ignorance and\nprejudice in the region, in these farm-houses will they be found; and in\ncompany with them morals of a high order are not to be looked for.\n\nIf small properties are held in partnership, poverty is present or\nthreatening. The condition of affairs cannot be lasting; and this may be\nwell; for narrow means and partnership in a property which requires to\nbe managed by skill are more favourable to discontent and disagreement\nthan to a kindly social state.\n\nThe middleman system is favourable or unfavourable to morals, just in\nproportion as it is so to prosperity. Every one knows the wretchedness\nof it in Ireland, and that there are numerous instances in Italy of the\ncomplete success of the métayer plan.\n\nWhere the land is the property of large owners, and is tilled by\nlabourers, there must be more or less of the feudal temper and manners\nremaining. Where the labourers are attached to the soil, there must\nnecessarily exist whatever good arises from the certainty of the means\nof subsistence, coupled with the evils of subservience to the will of\nthe lord, mental sluggishness, and ignorance. Where they are not\nirremovably attached to the soil, habit and helplessness have usually\nmuch of the same effect. The son hedges, ditches, or ploughs where his\nfather hedged, ditched, or ploughed; he takes his beer, or cider, or\nthin wine, (according to the country he lives in,) at the same house of\nentertainment, and gossips about the doings of the lord and his family,\nmuch as labourers were wont to gossip two hundred years ago.\n\nIt is the business of the traveller to note which mode of agricultural\nlife prevails, and how the morals which pertain to it are modified by\nparticular circumstances.\n\n * * * * *\n\nHe must make the same kind of observations on the Manufacturing and\nCommercial Classes of the country he visits. Here again the chief\ndifferences in morals and manners arise out of the comparative\nprosperity or adversity of the class. Take the cotton manufacture.\nPassing by the Chinese operative plying his shuttle as he sits under his\nbamboo shed, and the Hindoo drawing out his fine thread under the shade\nof the palm, what differences there are among artisans of the same\nrace,--Europeans and of European extraction! In Massachusetts there are\nvillages of artisans, where whole streets of houses are their property;\nthe church on the green in the midst is theirs; the Lyceum, with its\nlibrary and apparatus, is theirs. There are rows of neat\nframe-dwellings, painted white or yellow, with piazzas before and\nbehind, and Venetian blinds to every window,--all growing up out of the\nearnings of girls, who bring their widowed mothers to preside over their\nestablishments. Others are paying off the mortgages on their fathers'\nfarms. Others are procuring for their brothers a learned education in a\ncollege. In the cotton settlements of Europe what a contrast! At the\nbest, operatives can only provide for their wants, and the placing out\nof their children, by a life of strenuous toil. At the worst, they herd\ntogether, many families in one house,--often in one room; decency is\ndiscarded; recklessness succeeds, to such a degree that, in certain\nsections of the society, there is scarcely a man of thirty-five who is\nnot a grandfather. Among such there is a barbarism as savage as among\nthe most vicious aristocracy of the worst feudal times. The lowest\nartisan population of the present day may vie in corruption with the\nnoblesse of France on the eve of the first revolution. It is for the\ntraveller to observe what grade in the wide interval between the\noperatives of Massachusetts, and those of Lyons and Stockport, is\noccupied by the artisans of the places he visits.\n\n * * * * *\n\nUpon the extent of the Commerce of a country depends much of the\ncharacter of its morals. Old virtues and vices dwindle away, and new\nones appear. The old members of a rising commercial society complain of\nthe loss of simplicity of manners, of the introduction of new wants, of\nthe relaxation of morals, of the prevalence of new habits. The young\nmembers of the same society rejoice that prudery is going out of\nfashion, that gossip is likely to be replaced by the higher kind of\nintercourse which is introduced by strangers, and by an extension of\nknowledge and interests: they even decide that domestic morals are purer\nfrom the general enlargement and occupation of mind which has succeeded\nto the _ennui_ and selfishness in which licentiousness often originates.\nA highly remarkable picture of the two conditions of the same place may\nbe obtained by comparing Mrs. Grant's account of the town of Albany, New\nYork, in her young days,[N] with the present state of the city. She\ntells us of the plays of the children on the green slope which is now\nState Street; of the tea-drinkings and working parties, of the gossip,\nbickerings, and virulent petty enmities of the young society, with its\ngeneral regularity and occasional back-sliding; with the gentle\ndespotism of its opulent members, and the more or less restive or\nservile obedience of the subordinate personages. In place of all this,\nthe stranger now sees a city with magnificent public buildings, and\nprivate houses filled with the products of all the countries of the\nworld. The inhabitants are too busy to be given to gossip, too\nunrestrained in their intercourse with numbers to retain much prudery:\nsocial despotism and subservience have become impossible: there is a\ngenerous spirit of enterprise, an enlargement of knowledge, an\namelioration of opinion. There is, on the other hand, perhaps a decrease\nof kindly neighbourly regard, and certainly a great increase of the low\nvices which are the plague of commercial cities. Such is the\ntransformation wrought by commerce. An observer who can also\nspeculate,--one who looks before and after,--will conclude that, amidst\nsome evil, the change is advantageous; and that good must, on the whole,\narise from enlarged intercourses between men and societies. Seeing in\ncommerce the instrument by which all the inhabitants of the earth are in\ntime to be brought into common possession of all true ideas, and\nsympathy in all good feelings, he will mark the progress made by the\nsociety he visits towards this end. He will mark whether its merchants\nas a body have a spirit of generous enterprise or of sordid\nself-interest; whether they entertain a respect for learning and a taste\nfor art,--bringing the one from abroad, and cherishing the other at\nhome;--whether, in short, the merchants are the princes or the\nmoney-grubbers of the community. The spirit of this class will determine\nthat of their subordinates. If the masters of commerce are liberal and\nenlightened, their servants will be thriving, and will have the virtues\nwhich wait upon self-respect: if the contrary, they will be debased. A\nJewish money-lender is no more like a merchant of Salem or Bourdeaux\nthan Malay porters at Macao are like the clerk class of Amsterdam. In\nthe mercantile orders of society may be found the extremes of honour,\ngenerosity, diligence, and accuracy,--and of treachery, meanness, and\nselfish carelessness. It is the traveller's business to note the\ntendencies to the one or the other,--from the vexatious hog and yam\ntraffic of the islands of the South Sea, to the magnificent transactions\nof the traders of Hamburgh.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThe Health of a community is an almost unfailing index of its morals. No\none can wonder at this who considers how physical suffering irritates\nthe temper, depresses energy, deadens hope, induces recklessness, and,\nin short, poisons life. The domestic affections, too, are apt to\nlanguish through disappointment in countries where the average of death\nis very high. There is least marriage in unhealthy countries, and most\nin healthy ones,--other circumstances being equal. The same kind of\nspirit (however largely diluted) prevails in sickly regions as in\nsocieties which are visited by a pestilence. Study the tempers of the\npeople who are subject to goîtres, of those who live in marshes, of\nthose who encounter an annual tropical fever; and contrast it with that\nof dwellers on mountains, and in dry prairies, and in well-ventilated\ntowns. What selfishness, apathy, and discontent in the one class! and\nwhat kindliness, briskness, and cheerfulness in the other! In the United\nStates, wide spreading as the country is, and comprehending every\nvariety of people, and almost of climate, the common deficiency of\nhealth produces moral effects which must strike the most careless\ntraveller. The epicurean temper of the south, and the puritanic mood of\nthe north, are alike stimulated by this. In the south, the overseers,\nwhose business it is to encounter the fever, seem to be always\npractically saying, \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\" There\nis a recklessness among the trading classes there, a heathen levity and\ngrossness, which are doubtless in a great degree owing to the presence\nof slavery, but also in part to the certainty of a very large annual\nmortality. Not the purest Christianity itself could preserve a people so\nplaced from a more or less modified fatalism. The richer members of\nsociety leave their homes for some months of every year, and go\nnorthwards; and this perpetual unsettling of their families has a bad\neffect upon the habits of the young people and the comfort of their\nparents. It operates against domestic diligence, tranquillity, and\nsatisfaction with home pleasures. In the north, there is a perpetual\npreaching about death, enforced by the never-ceasing recurrence of it;\nbut it has not the effect of making people less worldly-minded than\nothers. It serves only to shade life with apprehension, uncertainty, and\nbereavement; and, it is to be feared, to give to the vanity of many\nminds the direction of false heroism about meeting death. This seems too\nserious a subject for the exercise of human vanity; yet that purpose it\nhas served, perhaps, in all societies; and in none more than in New\nEngland. The greater number of very young people, everywhere, who cannot\nbe aware of the importance of life, and of the simplicity of death as\nits close, have romantic thoughts about dying early; and, in a country\nwhere an unusual proportion do die early, this species of vain-glory is\nlikely to flourish. The pain felt everywhere by really enlarged and\nreligious minds on seeing a false resignation exhibited, and hearing\nshallow sentimentalities given out on the brink of the grave, is\npeculiarly felt in a region where mourning mothers may be seen who have\nlost eight, twelve, or fifteen children, and where scarcely an\nenterprise of any extent can be undertaken which is not almost sure to\nbe interrupted or baffled by sickness or death.--When these\nconsiderations are dwelt upon, and when it is remembered what the\nconsequences of a low state of health must be to each future generation,\nit seems scarcely extravagant to say that the best influence upon the\nmorals of the American nation would be such as might improve their\nhealth.\n\nGood and bad health are both cause and effect of good and bad morals. No\nproof of this is needed, nor any further dwelling upon the proposition.\nThe fact, however, points out to the observer the duty of obtaining a\ncorrect general estimate of the health of the community he visits.\n\nThere are two principal methods by which he may obtain the knowledge he\nwants,--by examining civic registers, and by visiting burial-grounds.\n\nA faithful register of births, marriages, and deaths, is wished for by\nenlightened philanthropists of all advanced countries, far more as a\ntest of national morals and the national welfare, than as a matter of\nthe highest social convenience. For this the physiologist waits as the\nmeans of determining the physical condition of the nation; as a guide to\nhim in suggesting and prescribing the methods by which the national\nhealth may be improved, and the average of life prolonged.--For this the\nlegislator waits as the means of determining the comparative proneness\nof the people to certain kinds of social offences, and the causes of\nthat proneness; that the law may be framed so as to include (as all wise\nlaws should include) the largest preventive influence with the greatest\ncertainty of retribution.--For this the philanthropist waits as a guide\nto him in forming his scheme of universal education; and without\nthis,--without knowing how many need education altogether,--how many\nunder one set of circumstances, and how many under another,--he can\nproceed only in darkness, or amidst the delusions of false lights. He is\nonly perplexed by the partial knowledge, which is all that his utmost\nefforts enable him to obtain. If he goes into every house of every town\nand village in his district, he is no nearer to an understanding of the\nintellectual and moral condition of the nation than he was before: for\nother districts have a different soil and different occupations; the\nemployments of the people, their diseases and their resources, are\nunlike; and, under these diverse influences, their physical, and\ntherefore moral and intellectual condition, must vary. The reports of\nPhilanthropic Societies do little more for him, drawn up as they are\nwith partial objects and under exclusive influences: parliamentary\ndisclosures are of little more use. Vague statements about the increase\nof drunkenness, resistance to one kind of law or another, alarm and\ndistress him; but such statements again are partial, and so often\nbrought forward for a particular object, that they afford no safe guide\nto him who would form a general preventive or remedy. Thus it is under\nall partial methods of observation; but when the philanthropist shall\ngain access to a register of the national births, marriages, and deaths,\nhe will have under his hand all the materials he requires, as completely\nas if he were hovering over the kingdom, comprehending all its districts\nin one view, and glancing at will into all its habitations.\n\nThe comparative ages of the dead will indicate to him not only the\namount of health, but the comparative force of various species of\ndisease; and from the character of its diseases, and the amount of its\nhealth, much of the moral state of a people may be safely pronounced\nupon. The proportion of marriages to births and deaths is always an\nindication of the degree of comfort enjoyed, and of the consequent\npurity of morals; and, therefore, of the degree in which education is\npresent or needed. A large number of children, and a large proportion of\nmarriages, indicate physical and moral welfare, and therefore a\ncomparative prevalence of education. A large number of births, and a\nsmall proportion of marriages, indicate the reverse. When these\ncircumstances are taken in connexion with the prevailing occupations of\nthe district to which they relate, the philanthropist has arrived at a\nsufficient certainty as to the means of education required, and the\nmethod in which they are to be applied.\n\nThere is, unfortunately, in all countries, an insufficiency of records\nframed for the purpose of induction, and subsequent practical use. The\nchief of a tribe, proud in proportion to his barbarian insignificance,\nmay from time to time indulge himself by numbering the people whom he\nconsiders as his property; and an ambitious and warlike emperor may\norganize a conscription; and these records may remain to fulfil\nhereafter far more exalted purposes than those for which they were\ndesigned: but these instances are few; and in the art of constructing\ntables, and ascertaining averages, the most civilized people are still,\nfor want of practice, in a state of unskilfulness. But, in the absence\nof that which would spare observers the task of ascertaining results for\nthemselves, they must take the best they can get. A traveller must\ninquire for any public registers which may exist in all districts, and\nnote and reflect upon the facts he finds there. In case of there being\nnone such, it is possible that the physicians of the district may be\nable to afford information from private documents of the same nature. If\nnot, there remain the cemeteries.\n\nThe calculators of longevity believe that they may now, by taking down\nthe dates from the first thirty tombstones in the cemeteries of the\ndistricts they pass through, learn the comparative healthiness and\nlength of life of the inhabitants of the country. However this may be,\nthere is no doubt that a large variety and extent of information may be\nthus obtained. The observer can ascertain where the fatal diseases of\ninfancy most prevail,--which is the same thing as knowing that the\nphysical and moral condition of the people is low; as a large proportion\n(not mere number) of deaths in infancy is a most unfavourable symptom of\nsociety. He can ascertain where consumption prevails, where fever, and\nwhere the largest proportion attains to length of days. It is much to\nknow what character disease and death wear in any district. One\ncharacter of Morals and Manners prevails where the greater number die\nyoung, and another where they die old; one where they are cut off by\nhardship; another where they waste away under a lingering disease; and\nyet another where they abide their full time, and then come to their\ngraves like a shock of corn in its season. The grave-yards on the\nheights of the Alleghanies will tell a different tale of Morals and\nManners from the New Orleans' cemetery, glaring in the midst of the\nswamp; and so would the burial-places in the suburbs of Irish cities,\nif their contents were known, from those of the hardy Waldenses, or of\nthe decent and thriving colonists of Frederick's-oord.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThe Marriage compact is the most important feature of the domestic state\non which the observer can fix his attention. If he be a thinker, he will\nnot be surprised at finding much imperfection in the marriage state\nwherever he goes. By no arrangements yet attempted have purity of\nmorals, constancy of affection, and domestic peace been secured to any\nextensive degree in society. Almost every variety of method is still in\nuse, in one part of the world or another. The primitive custom of\nbrothers marrying sisters still subsists in some Eastern regions.\nPolygamy is very common there, as every one knows. In countries which\nare too far advanced for this, every restraint of law, all sanction of\nopinion, has been tried to render the natural method,--the restriction\nof one husband to one wife,--successful, and therefore universal and\npermanent. Law and opinion have, however, never availed to anything like\ncomplete success. Even in thriving young countries, where no\nconsiderations of want, and few of ambition, can interfere with domestic\npeace,--where the numbers are equal, where love has the promise of a\nfree and even course, and where religious sentiment is directed full\nupon the sanctity of the marriage state,--it is found to be far from\npure. In almost all countries, the corruption of society in this\ndepartment is so deep and wide-spreading, as to vitiate both moral\nsentiment and practice in an almost hopeless degree. It neutralizes\nalmost all attempts to ameliorate and elevate the condition of the\nrace.--There must be something fearfully wrong where the general result\nis so unfortunate as this. As in most other cases of social suffering,\nthe wrong will be found to lie less in the methods ordained and put in\npractice, than in the prevalent sentiment of society, out of which all\nmethods arise.\n\nIt is necessary to make mention (however briefly) of the kinds of false\nsentiment from which the evil of conjugal unhappiness appears to\nspring.--The sentiment by which courage is made the chief ground of\nhonour in men, and chastity in women, coupled with the inferiority in\nwhich women have ever been sunk, was sure to induce profligacy. As long\nas men were brave nothing more was required to make them honourable in\nthe eyes of society: while the inferior condition of women has ever\nexposed those of them who were not protected by birth and wealth to the\nprofligacy of men.--The shallowness of the sentiment of honour is\nanother great evil. In its origin, honour includes self-respect and the\nrespect of others. In time, \"from its intimate connexion with what is\npersonal in interest and feeling, it is greatly exposed to degenerate\ninto a false and misguiding sentiment. Connecting itself with the\nnotions of character which prevail by chance in the community, rather\nthan with the rule of right and of God, it has erected a false standard\nof estimate.\" The requisitions of honour come to be viewed as regarding\nonly equals, or those who are hedged about with honour, and they are\nneglected with regard to the helpless. Men of honour use treachery with\nwomen,--with those to whom they promise marriage, and with those to\nwhom, in marrying, they promised fidelity, love, and care; and yet their\nhonour is, in the eyes of society, unstained.--Feudal ambition is\nanother sentiment fraught with evil to marriage. In a society where\npride and ostentation prevail, where rank and wealth are regarded as\nprime objects of pursuit, marriage comes to be regarded as a means of\nobtaining these. Wives are selected for their connexions and their\nfortune, and the love is placed elsewhere.--Any one of these corrupt\nspecies of sentiment, and of some others which exist, must ruin domestic\npeace, if the laws of each country were as wise as they are now, for the\nmost part, faulty, and as powerful as they are now ineffectual.--If the\ntraveller will bear these things in mind, he will gain light upon the\nmoral sentiment of the society by the condition of domestic life in it;\nand again, what he knows of the prevalent moral sentiment of the society\nwill cast light upon the domestic condition of its members.\n\nAnother thing to be carefully remembered is, that asceticism and\nlicentiousness universally coexist. All experience proves this; and\nevery principle of human nature might prophesy the proof. Passions and\nemotions cannot be extinguished by general rules. Self-mortification can\nspring only out of a home-felt principle, and not from the will of\nanother, or of any number of others. The exhibition only can be\nrestrained, and the visible conduct ordered by rule. In consequence, it\nis found that no greater impurity of mind exists than among associated\nascetics; and nowhere are crimes of the licentious class so gross, other\ncircumstances being equal, as in communities which have the puritanic\nspirit. Any one well-informed on the subject is aware that there is much\ncoarseness in the manners of the Quakers; and their regard for the\npleasures of the table is open to the observation of all. Nowhere are\ndrunkenness and infanticide more disgusting and horrible, when they do\noccur, than in Calvinistic Scotland. The bottomless corruption of Vienna\nis notorious; and much of it is traceable to a species of political\nasceticism,--to artificial restrictions other than religious, but\nproducing similar effects. Politics are a forbidden topic of\nconversation. Under this rule, literature is a forbidden topic too; for\nliterary and philosophical necessarily induces political communication.\nIn Vienna may be seen the singular spectacle of an assembled multitude\nwho read, not one of whom opens his lips upon books, or their subject\nmatter. What then remains? Gallantry. The intellect being silenced, the\npassions run riot; and the excessive corruption of the society,--a\ncorruption which is notorious over the civilized world,--is the natural\nconsequence. It may safely be assumed that wherever artificial\nrestraints are imposed on the passions, or on the intellects and\npursuits of men, there must be licentiousness, precisely proportioned to\nthe severity of the restraint.\n\nCelibacy of the clergy, or of any other class of men, involves\npolygamy, virtual if not avowed, in some other class. To this the\nrelaxation of domestic morals in the higher orders of all Catholic\nsocieties bears testimony as strongly as the existence of allowed\npolygamy in India. It is everywhere professed that Christianity puts\nan end to polygamy; and so it does, as Christianity is understood in\nProtestant countries; but a glance at the state of morals in countries\nwhere celibacy is the religion of the clergy,--among the higher ranks\nin Italy, in France, in Spain,--shows that, while the name of polygamy\nis disclaimed, the thing is held in no great abhorrence. This is\nmentioned here simply as matter of fact, necessary to our inquiry as to\nhow to observe morals and manners. It is notorious that, wherever\ncelibacy is extensively professed, there is not only, as a consequence,\na frequent breach of profession, but a much larger indulgence extended\nto other classes, in consequence of the restrictions on one. The methods\nof marriage in Italy and France,--the disposing of the woman at an early\nage, and before she is capable of giving an enlightened consent,--often\neven without the form of asking her consent,--on the understanding,\ntacit or avowed, that she may hereafter place her affections\nelsewhere,--these proceedings could have been adopted, could now be\npersevered in, only in countries where partial asceticism had induced a\ncorresponding licentiousness.--The same fact,--the invariable proportion\nof asceticism and licentiousness,--exists where by some it would be\nleast looked for,--in societies which have the reputation of being\neminently pure; and this consideration is sufficient to extinguish all\nboasting, all assumption of unquestionable moral superiority in one\npeople over another. It is not only that each nation likes its own\nnotions of morals better than those of its neighbours; but that the\nvery same things which are avowed among those who are called the\ngrossest, happen with that which considers itself the most pure. Such\nsuperiority as there is is owing, perhaps, in no case to severity of\nreligious sentiment and discipline, but rather to the worldly ease which\nblesses a young and thinly peopled country, and to the high cultivation\nof a society which furnishes its members with an extraordinary diversity\nof interests and pursuits.\n\nMarriage exists everywhere, to be studied by the moral observer. He must\nwatch the character of courtships wherever he goes;--whether the young\nlady is negociated for and promised by her guardians, without having\nseen her intended; like the poor girl who, when she asked her mother to\npoint out her future husband from among a number of gentlemen, was\nsilenced with the rebuke, \"What is that to you?\"--or whether they are\nleft free to exchange their faith \"by flowing stream, through wood, or\ncraggy wild,\" as in the United States;--or whether there is a medium\nbetween these two extremes, as in England. He must observe how fate is\ndefied by lovers in various countries. We have seen what was the\nacquiescence of Philip and Hannah in their eternal separation. None but\nMoravians, perhaps, would have so parted for ever. Scotch lovers agree\nto come together after so many years spent in providing the\n\"plenishing.\" Irish lovers conclude the business, in case of difficulty,\nby appearing before the priest the next morning. There is recourse to a\nbalcony and rope-ladder in one country; a steam-boat and back-settlement\nin another; trust and patience in a third; and intermediate\nflirtations, to pass the time, in a fourth. He must note the degree of\nworldly ambition which attends marriages, and which may therefore be\nsupposed to stimulate them,--how much space the house with two rooms in\nhumble life, and the country-seat and carriages in higher life, occupy\nin the mind of bride or bridegroom.--He must observe whether conjugal\ninfidelity excites horror and rage, or whether it is so much a matter of\ncourse as that no jealousy interferes to mar the arrangements of mutual\nconvenience.--He must mark whether women are made absolutely the\nproperty of their husbands, in mind and in estate; or whether the wife\nis treated more or less professedly as an equal party in the\nagreement.--He must observe whether there is an excluded class, victims\nto their own superstition or to a false social obligation, wandering\nabout to disturb by their jealousy or licentiousness those whose lot is\nhappier.--He must observe whether there are domestic arrangements for\nhome enjoyments, or whether all is planned on the supposition of\npleasure lying abroad; whether the reliance is on books, gardens, and\nplay with children, or on the opera, parties, the ale-house, or dances\non the green.--He must mark whether the ladies are occupied with their\nhousehold cares in the morning, and the society of their husbands in the\nevening, or with embroidery and looking out of balconies; with receiving\ncompany all day, or gadding abroad; with the library or the nursery;\nwith lovers or with children.--In each country, called civilized, he\nwill meet with almost all these varieties: but in each there is such a\nprevailing character in the aspect of domestic life, that intelligent\nobservation will enable him to decide, without much danger of mistake,\nas to whether marriage is merely an arrangement of convenience, in\naccordance with low morals, or a sacred institution, commanding the\nreverence and affection of a virtuous people. No high degree of this\nsanctity can be looked for till that moderation is attained which,\nduring the prevalence of asceticism and its opposite, is reached only by\na few. That it yet exists nowhere as the characteristic of any\nsociety,--that all the blessings of domestic life are not yet open to\nall, so as to preclude the danger of any one encroaching on his\nneighbour,--is but too evident to the travelled observer. He can only\nmark the degree of approximation to this state of high morals wherever\nhe goes.\n\nThe traveller everywhere finds woman treated as the inferior party in a\ncompact in which both parties have an equal interest. Any agreement thus\nformed is imperfect, and is liable to disturbance; and the danger is\ngreat in proportion to the degradation of the supposed weaker party. The\ndegree of the degradation of woman is as good a test as the moralist can\nadopt for ascertaining the state of domestic morals in any country.\n\nThe Indian squaw carries the household burdens, trudging in the dust,\nwhile her husband on horseback paces before her, unencumbered but by his\nown gay trappings. She carries the wallet with food, the matting for the\nlodge, the merchandize (if they possess any), and her infant. There is\nno exemption from labour for the squaw of the most vaunted chief. In\nother countries the wife may be found drawing the plough, hewing wood\nand carrying water; the men of the family standing idle to witness her\ntoils. Here the observer may feel pretty sure of his case. From a\ncondition of slavery like this, women are found rising to the highest\ncondition in which they are at present seen, in France, England, and the\nUnited States,--where they are less than half-educated, precluded from\nearning a subsistence, except in a very few ill-paid employments, and\nprohibited from giving or withholding their assent to laws which they\nare yet bound by penalties to obey. In France, owing to the great\ndestruction of men in the wars of Napoleon, women are engaged, and\nsuccessfully engaged, in a variety of occupations which have been\nelsewhere supposed unsuitable to the sex. Yet there remains so large a\nnumber who cannot, by the most strenuous labour in feminine employments,\ncommand the necessaries of life, while its luxuries may be earned by\ninfamy, that the morals of the society are naturally bad. Great\nattention has of late been given to this subject in France: the social\ncondition of women is matter of thought and discussion to a degree which\npromises some considerable amelioration. Already, women can do more in\nFrance than anywhere else; they can attempt more without ridicule or\narbitrary hinderance: and the women of France are probably destined to\nlead the way in the advance which the sex must hereafter make. At\npresent, society is undergoing a transition from a feudal state to one\nof mutual government; and women, gaining in some ways, suffer in others\nduring the process. They have, happily for themselves, lost much of the\npeculiar kind of observance which was the most remarkable feature of the\nchivalrous age; and it has been impossible to prevent their sharing in\nthe benefits of the improvement and diffusion of knowledge. All\ncultivation of their powers has secured to them the use of new power; so\nthat their condition is far superior to what it was in any former age.\nBut new difficulties about securing a maintenance have arisen. Marriage\nis less general; and the husbands of the greater number of women are not\nsecure of a maintenance from the lords of the soil, any more than women\nare from being married. The charge of their own maintenance is thrown\nupon large numbers of women, without the requisite variety of\nemployments having been opened to them, or the needful education\nimparted. A natural consequence of this is, that women are educated to\nconsider marriage the one object in life, and therefore to be extremely\nimpatient to secure it. The unfavourable influence of these results upon\nthe happiness of domestic life may be seen at a glance.\n\nThis may be considered the sum and substance of female education in\nEngland; and the case is scarcely better in France, though the\nindependence and practical efficiency of women there are greater than in\nany other country. The women in the United States are in a lower\ncondition than either, though there is less striving after marriage,\nfrom its greater frequency, and little restriction is imposed upon the\nbook-learning which women may obtain. But the old feudal notions about\nthe sex flourish there, while they are going out in the more advanced\ncountries of Europe; and these notions, in reality, regulate the\ncondition of women. American women generally are treated in no degree as\nequals, but with a kind of superstitious outward observance, which, as\nthey have done nothing to earn it, is false and hurtful. Coexisting\nwith this, there is an extreme difficulty in a woman's obtaining a\nmaintenance, except by the exercise of some rare powers. In a country\nwhere women are brought up to be indulged wives, there is no hope, help,\nor prospect for such as have not money and are not married.\n\nIn America, women can earn a maintenance only by teaching, sewing,\nemployment in factories, keeping boarding-houses, and domestic service.\nSome governesses are tolerably well paid,--comparing their earnings with\nthose of men. Employment in factories, and domestic service, are well\npaid. Sewing is so wretched an occupation everywhere, that it is to be\nhoped that machinery will soon supersede the use of human fingers in a\nlabour so unprofitable. In Boston, Massachusetts, a woman is paid\nninepence (sixpence English) for making a shirt.--In England, besides\nthese occupations, others are opening; and, what is of yet greater\nconsequence, the public mind is awakening to the necessity of enlarging\nthe sphere of female industry. Some of the inferior branches of the fine\narts have lately offered profitable employment to many women. The\ncommercial adversity to which the country has been exposed from time to\ntime, has been of service to the sex, by throwing hundreds and thousands\nof them upon their own resources, and thus impelling them to urge claims\nand show powers which are more respected every day.--In France this is\nyet more conspicuously the case. There, women are shopkeepers,\nmerchants, professional accountants, editors of newspapers, and employed\nin many other ways, unexampled elsewhere, but natural and respectable\nenough on the spot.\n\nDomestic morals are affected in two principal respects by these\ndifferences. Where feminine occupations of a profitable nature are few,\nand therefore overstocked, and therefore yielding a scanty maintenance\nwith difficulty, there is the strongest temptation to prefer luxury with\ninfamy to hardship with unrecognized honour. Hence arises much of the\ncorruption of cities,--less in the United States than in Europe, from\nthe prevalence of marriage,--but awful in extent everywhere. Where vice\nis made to appear the interest of large classes of women, the observer\nmay be quite sure that domestic morals will be found impure. If he can\nmeet with any society where the objects of life are as various and as\nfreely open to women as to men, there he may be sure of finding the\ngreatest amount of domestic purity and peace; for, if women were not\nhelpless, men would find it far less easy to be vicious.\n\nThe other way in which domestic morals are affected by the scope which\nis allowed to the powers of women, is through the views of marriage\nwhich are induced. Marriage is debased by being considered the one\nworldly object in life,--that on which maintenance, consequence, and\npower depend. Where the husband marries for connexion, fortune, or an\nheir to his estate, and the wife for an establishment, for consequence,\nor influence, there is no foundation for high domestic morals and\nlasting peace; and in a country where marriage is made the single aim of\nall women, there is no security against the influence of some of these\nmotives even in the simplest and purest cases of attachment. The\nsordidness is infused from the earliest years; the taint is in the mind\nbefore the attachment begins, before the objects meet; and the evil\neffects upon the marriage state are incalculable.\n\nAll this--the sentiment of society with regard to Woman and to Marriage,\nthe social condition of Woman, and the consequent tendency and aim of\nher education,--the traveller must carefully observe. Each civilized\nsociety claims for itself the superiority in its treatment of woman. In\none, she is indulged with religious shows, and with masquerades, or\nPunch, as an occasional variety. In another, she is left in honourable\nand undisputed possession of the housekeeping department. In a third,\nshe is allowed to meddle, behind the scenes, with the business which is\nconfided to her husband's management. In a fourth, she is satisfied in\nbeing the cherished domestic companion, unaware of the injury of being\ndoomed to the narrowness of mind which is the portion of those who are\nalways confined to the domestic circle. In a fifth, she is flattered at\nbeing guarded and indulged as a being requiring incessant fostering, and\ntoo feeble to take care of herself. In a sixth society, there may be\nfound expanding means of independent occupation, of responsible\nemployment for women; and here, other circumstances being equal, is the\nbest promise of domestic fidelity and enjoyment.\n\nIt is a matter of course that women who are furnished with but one\nobject,--marriage,--must be as unfit for anything when their aim is\naccomplished as if they had never had any object at all. They are no\nmore equal to the task of education than to that of governing the state;\nand, if any unexpected turn of adversity befals them, they have no\nresource but a convent, or some other charitable provision. Where, on\nthe other hand, women are brought up capable of maintaining an\nindependent existence, other objects remain when the grand one is\naccomplished. Their independence of mind places them beyond the reach of\nthe spoiler; and their cultivated faculty of reason renders them worthy\nguardians of the rational beings whose weal or woe is lodged in their\nhands. There is yet, as may be seen by a mere glance over society, only\na very imperfect provision made anywhere for doing justice to the next\ngeneration by qualifying their mothers; but the observer of morals may\nprofit by marking the degrees in which this imperfection approaches to\nbarbarism. Where he finds that girls are committed to convents for\neducation, and have no alternative in life but marriage, in which their\nwill has no share, and a return to their convent, he may safely conclude\nthat there a plurality of lovers is a matter of course, and domestic\nenjoyments of the highest kind undesired and unknown. He may conclude\nthat as are the parents, so will be the children; and that, for one more\ngeneration at least, there will be little or no improvement. But where\nhe finds a variety of occupations open to women; where he perceives them\nnot only pursuing the lighter mechanic arts, dispensing charity and\norganizing schools for the poor, but occupied in education, and in the\nstudy of science and the practice of the fine arts, he may conclude that\nhere resides the highest domestic enjoyment which has yet been attained,\nand the strongest hope of a further advance.\n\n * * * * *\n\nChildren in all countries are, as Mrs. Grant of Laggan says, first\nvegetables, and then they are animals, and then they come to be people;\nbut their way of growing out of one stage into another is as different,\nin different societies, as their states of mind when they are grown up.\nThey all have limbs, senses, and intellects; but their growth of heart\nand mind depends incalculably upon the spirit of the society amidst\nwhich they are reared. The traveller must study them wherever he meets\nthem. In one country, multitudes of them lie about in the streets,\nbasking in the sun, and killing vermin; while the children of the very\npoorest persons of another country are decently clothed, and either\nbusily occupied with such domestic employments as they are capable of,\nor at school, or playing among the rocks, or climbing trees, or crawling\nabout the wooden bridges, without fear or danger. From this one symptom,\nthe observer might learn the poverty and idleness of the lower classes\nof Spain, and the comfort and industry of those of the United States. As\nto the children of the richer classes, there is the widest difference in\nthe world between those who are the idols of their mothers, (as in\nsocieties where the heart's love is lavished on the children which has\nnot been engaged by the husband,) and those who are early steeped in\ncorruption, (as in slave countries,) and those who are reared\nphilosophers and saints, and those to whom home is a sunny paradise\nhedged round with love and care, and those who are little men and women\nof the world from the time they can walk alone. All these kinds of\nchildren exist,--sure breathings of the moral atmosphere of their homes.\nThe traveller must watch them, talk with them, and learn from their\nbearing towards their parents, and the bent of their affections, what is\nthe spirit of the families of the land.\n\nFrom observation on these classes of facts,--the Occupation of the\npeople, the respective Characters of the occupied classes, the Health of\nthe population, the state of Marriage and of Women, and the character of\nChildhood,--the moralist may learn more of the private life of a\ncommunity than from the conversation of any number of the individuals\nwho compose it.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nIDEA OF LIBERTY.\n\n \"He who taught man to vanquish whatsoever\n Can be between the cradle and the grave,\n Crowned him the King of Life. O vain endeavour,\n If on his own high will, a willing slave,\n He has enthroned the oppression and the oppressor!\n What if earth can clothe and feed\n Amplest millions at their need,\n And power in thought be as the tree within the seed?\n Or what if Art, an ardent intercessor,\n Diving on fiery wings to Nature's throne,\n Checks the great mother stooping to caress her,\n And cries, Give me, thy child, dominion\n Over all height and depth? If Life can breed\n New wants, and wealth from those who toil and groan\n Rend of thy gifts and her's a thousandfold for one.\"\n _Shelley._\n\nThe same rule--of observing Things in preference to relying upon the\nDiscourse of persons--holds good in the task of ascertaining the Idea of\nLiberty entertained and realized by any society. The Things to be\nobserved for this purpose are those which follow.\n\nThe most obvious consideration of all is the amount of feudal\narrangements which remain,--so obvious as to require only a bare\nmention. If people are satisfied to obey the will of a lord of the soil,\nto go out to hunt or to fight at his bidding, to require his consent to\nmarriages among his dependants, and to hold whatever they have at his\npermission, their case is clear. They are destitute of any idea of\nliberty, and can be considered at best only half-civilized.--It matters\nlittle whether all this subservience is yielded to the owner of an\nestate, or the sovereign of the country, represented by his police or\nsoldiery. Blind, ignorant obedience to any ruling power which the\nsubjects had no hand in constituting, on the one part, and the\nenforcement of that obedience on the other, is the feudal temper.\n\nA sleek Austrian of the middle ranks stood, of late, smoking at his\ndoor. A practical joker, who had a mind to see how far the man's\ndeference for the police would carry him, drew towards him, and\nwhispered in his ear, \"You must dance.\" The Austrian stared. \"Dance, I\nsay!\" repeated the stranger, with an air of authority. \"Why must I\ndance?\" asked the Austrian, when he had removed the pipe from his mouth.\n\"Because I, an agent of the police, insist upon it.\" The Austrian\ninstantly began capering, and continued his exercise till desired to\nstand still, assured that he had satisfied the police.--In the United\nStates, the contrast is amusing. On occasions of public assembly, the\nappeal is made to the democratic sentiment of the people to preserve\norder. If an orator is to hold forth on an anniversary, the soldiers\n(most citizen-like militia) may be seen putting their arms round the\nnecks of newly arrived listeners, in supplication that they will leave\nseats vacant for the band. If a piece of plate is to be presented to a\nstatesman, and twice as many people throng to the theatre as the\nbuilding will hold, harangues may be heard from the neighbouring\nbalconies,--appeals to the gallantry and kindliness of the crowd,--which\nare found quite as effectual in controlling the movements of the\nassemblage as any number of bayonets or constables' staves could be.\n\nThis leads to the mention of the Police of a country as a sure sign of\nthe idea of liberty existing within it. Where the soldiery are the\nguards of social order, it makes all the difference whether they are\nroyal troops,--a destructive machinery organized against the people,--or\na National Guard, springing up when needed from among the people, for\nthe people's sake,--or a militia, like the American, mentioned\nabove,--virtually stewards of the meeting, and nothing more. Whatever\nmay be thought of the comparative ease of proceeding, on any given\noccasion, between a police like that of Paris, and a constabulary like\nthat of the American cities, (a mockery to European rulers,) it is a\nstriking fact that order has been generally preserved for half a\ncentury, in a country where public meetings are a hundred times as\nnumerous as in any kingdom in Europe, by means which would in Europe be\nno means at all. It is clear that the idea of liberty must be elevated,\nand the love of social order intelligent and strong, where the peace has\nbeen kept through unanimity of will. With the exception of outrages\ngrowing out of the institution of slavery, (which require a deeper\ntreatment than any species of constabulary can practise,) the United\nStates, with opportunities of disturbance which have been as a hundred\nto one, have exhibited fewer instances of a breach of public order than\nany other country in the same space of time; and this order has been\npreserved by the popular will, in the full knowledge on all hands that\nno power existed to control this will. This is a fact which speaks\nvolumes in favour of the principles, if not the policy, of the American\npeople.\n\nIn the United States, the traveller may proceed a thousand miles in any\ndirection, or live ten years in one place, without the idea of control,\nbeyond that of social convenience, being once presented to his mind.\nPaul Louis Courier gives us the experience of an acquaintance of his.\n\"Un homme que j'ai vu arrive d'Amérique. Il y est resté trois ans sans\nentendre parler de ce que nous appelons ici l'autorité. Il a vécu trois\nans sans être gouverné, s'ennuyant à périr.\"--In France, he cannot go in\nsearch of the site of the Bastille without finding himself surrounded by\nwatchers before he has stood five minutes.--In Italy, his trunks are\nopened to examine the books he carries, and compare them with the list\nof proscribed works.--In Spain, he can say nothing in public that is not\nlikely to be known to the authorities before the day is out; or in\nprivate that is not in possession of some priest after the next period\nof confession.--In Switzerland, he finds that he is free to do any thing\nbut make inquiries about the condition of the country. If he asks, as\nthe Emperor Joseph did before him, \"Quels sont les revenues de votre\nrépublique?\" he may receive the same answer, \"Ils excedent nos\ndépenses.\"--In Germany, his case is like that of the inhabitants of the\ncities;--his course is open and agreeable as long as he pursues inferior\nobjects, but it is made extremely inconvenient to him to gratify his\ninterest in politics.--In Poland, evidences of authority will meet his\nobservation in every direction, while he will rarely hear the name of\nits head.--In Russia, he will find the people speaking of their despot\nas their father, and will perceive that it is more offensive to allude\nto the mortality of emperors than to talk lightly to children of the\ndeath of their parents. A gentleman in the suite of an English\nambassador inquired, after having been conducted over the imperial\npalace at St. Petersburgh, which of the rooms he had seen was that in\nwhich the Emperor Paul was killed. No answer was returned to his\nquestion, nor to his repetition of it. He imprudently persisted till\nsome reply was necessary. His guide whispered, with white lips, \"Paul\nwas not killed. Emperors do not die; they transpire out of life.\"\n\nSuch are some of the relations of the people to authority which will\nstrike the observation of the traveller in the most civilized of foreign\ncountries. These will be further illustrated by the smallest\ncircumstances which meet his eye that can in any way indicate what are\nthe functions of the police, and where it has most or least authority.\nThe Emperor Paul issued an ukase about shoestrings, which it was highly\npenal to disobey. His son has lately ordained the precise measurement of\nwhiskers, and cut of the hair behind, to be observed by the officers of\nthe army. In some regions, all men go armed: in others, it is penal to\nwear arms: in others, people may do as they please. In some countries,\nthere are costumes of classes enforced by law: in others, by opinion:\nwhile fashion is the only dictator in a third. In some societies\ncitizens must obtain leave from the authorities to move from place to\nplace: in others, strangers alone are plagued with passports: in\nothers, there is perfect freedom of locomotion for all.--In his\nobservation of the workings of authority, as embodied in a police, his\nown experience of restraint or liberty will afford him ample material\nfor thought, and ground of inference.\n\nSuch restraint as exists derives its character chiefly from its origin.\nIt makes a wide difference whether the police are the creatures of a\ndespotic sovereign who treats his subjects as property; or whether they\nare the agents of a representative government, appointed by responsible\nrulers for the public good; or whether they are the servants of a\nself-governing people, chosen by those among whom their work lies. It\nmakes a wide difference whether they are in the secret pay of an\nirresponsible individual, or appointed by command of a parliament, or\nelected by a concourse of citizens. In any case, their existence and\ntheir function testify to the absence or presence of a general idea of\nliberty among the people; and to its nature, if present.\n\n * * * * *\n\nIt is taken for granted that the traveller is informed, before he sets\nout, respecting the form of Government and general course of Legislation\nof the nation he studies. He will watch both, attending upon the\nadministration as well as the formation of laws,--visiting, where it is\nallowed, the courts of justice as well as the halls of parliament. But\nhe must remember that neither the composition of the government, nor the\nbody of the laws, nor the administration of them, is an evidence of\nwhat the idea of liberty at present is among the people, except in a\ndemocratic republic, where the acts of the government are the result of\nthe last expression of the national will. Every other representative\nsystem is too partial for its legislative acts to be more than the\nexpression of the will of a party; and the great body of laws is\neverywhere, except in America, the work of preceding ages. Though,\ntherefore, the observer will allow no great legislative and\nadministrative acts to pass without his notice, he will apply himself to\nother sets of circumstances to ascertain what is the existing idea of\nliberty prevalent among the people. He will observe, from certain facts\nof their position, what this idea must be; and, from certain classes of\ntheir own deeds, what it actually is.\n\nOne of the most important circumstances is, whether the population is\nthinly sprinkled over the face of the country, or whether it is\ncollected into neighbourly societies. This all-important condition has\nbeen alluded to so often already that it is only necessary to remind the\nobserver never to lose sight of it. \"Plus un peuple nombreux se\nrapproche,\" says Rousseau, \"moins le gouvernement peut usurper sur le\nsouverain. L'avantage d'un gouvernement tyrannique est donc en ceci,\nd'agir à grandes distances. A l'aide des points d'appui qu'il se donne,\nsa force augmente au loin, comme celle des léviers. Celle du peuple, au\ncontraire, n'agit que concentrée: elle s'évapore et se perd en\ns'étendant, comme l'effet de la poudre éparse à terre, et qui ne prend\nfeu que grain à grain. Les pays les moins peuplés sont ainsi les plus\npropres à la tyrannie. Les bêtes féroces ne règnent que dans les\ndéserts.\"\n\nIt is obvious enough that the Idea of Liberty, which can originate only\nin the intercourse of many minds, as the liberty itself can be wrought\nout only by the labours of many united hands, is not to be looked for\nwhere the people live apart, and are destitute of any knowledge of the\ninterests and desires of the community at large.\n\n * * * * *\n\nWhether the society is divided into Two Classes, or whether there is a\nGradation, is another important consideration. Where there are only two,\nproprietors and labourers, the Idea of Liberty is deficient or absent.\nThe proprietory class can have no other desires on the subject than to\nrepress the encroachments of the sovereign above them, or of the servile\nclass below them: and in the servile class the conception of liberty is\nyet unformed. Only in barbarous countries, in countries where slavery\nsubsists, and in some few strongholds of feudalism, is this decided\ndivision of society into two classes now to be found. Everywhere else\nthere is more or less gradation; and in the most advanced countries the\nclasses are least distinguishable. Below those members who, in European\nsocieties, are distinguished by birth, there is class beneath class of\ncapitalists, though it is usual to comprehend them all, for convenience\nof speech, under the name of the middle class. Thus society in Great\nBritain, France, and Germany is commonly spoken of as consisting of\nthree classes; while the divisions of the middle class are, in fact,\nvery numerous. The small shopkeeper is not of the same class with the\nlandowner, or wealthy banker, or professional man; while their views of\nlife, their political principles, and their social aspirations, are as\ndifferent as those of the peer and the mechanic.\n\nThere are two pledges of the advancement of the idea of liberty in a\ncommunity:--the one is the mingling of the functions of proprietor and\nlabourer throughout the whole of a society ruled by a representative\ngovernment; the other is the graduation of ranks by some other principle\nthan hereditary succession.\n\nIn ancient times most men were proprietors and labourers too; but under\ndespotic rule. Societies which have once come under the representative\nprinciple are not likely to retrograde to this state; while there are\ninfluences ever at work to exalt the function of labour, and to extend\nthat of proprietorship. Wherever this mixture of functions has gone the\nfurthest,--wherever the mechanic classes are becoming capitalists, and\nproprietors are liable to sink down from their ancient honour, unless\nthey can secure respect by personal qualifications, the idea of liberty\nis, to a considerable degree, confirmed and elevated. In such a case, it\nis clear that both the power and the desire of encroachment on the part\nof the upper class must be lessened, and that of resistance on the part\nof the lower increased.--The other improvement follows upon this.\nProprietorship, with its feudal influences, having lost caste (though it\nhas gained in true dignity), some other ground of distinction must\nsucceed. If we may judge by what is before our eyes in the Western\nworld, talent is likely to be the next successor. It is to be hoped that\ntalent will, in its turn, give way to moral worth,--the higher degrees\nof which imply, however, superiority of mental power. The preference of\npersonal qualifications to those of external endowment has already begun\nin the world, and is fast making its way. Such distinction of ranks as\nthere is in America originates in mental qualifications. Statesmen, who\nrise by their own power, rank highest; and then authors. The wealthiest\ncapitalist gives place, in the estimation of all, to a popular orator, a\nsuccessful author, or an eminent clergyman.--In France, the honours of\nthe peerage and the offices of the state are given to men of science,\nphilosophy, and literature. The same is the case in some parts of\nGermany: and, even in aristocratic England, the younger members of her\nUpper House are unsatisfied with being merely peers, and are anxious to\npush their way in literature, as well as in politics.--The traveller\nmust give earnest heed to symptoms like these, knowing that as the\nbarriers of ranks are thrown down, and personal obtain the ascendant\nover hereditary qualifications, social coercion must be relaxed, and the\nsentiment of liberty exalted.\n\n * * * * *\n\nIn close connexion with this, he must observe the condition of Servants.\nThe treatment and conduct of domestics depend on causes which lie far\ndeeper than the principles and tempers of particular servants and\nmasters, as may be seen by a glance at domestic service in England,\nScotland, and Ireland. In England, the old Saxon and Norman feud\nsmoulders, (however unconscious the parties may be of the fact,) in the\nrelation of master and servant. Domestics who never heard of either\nNorman or Saxon entertain a deep-rooted conviction of their masters'\ninterests and their own being directly opposed, and are subject to a\nstrong sense of injury. Masters who never bestow a thought on the\ntransactions of the twelfth century, complain of a doggedness,\nselfishness, and case-hardened indifference in the class of domestics,\nwhich kindness cannot penetrate, or penetrates only to pervert. The\nrelation is therefore a painful one in England. There is little\nsatisfaction to be obtained between the extremes of servility and\ndefiance, by which the conduct of servants is almost as distinctly\nmarked now as when the nation was younger by seven centuries. The\nEnglish housewives complain that confidence only makes their maid\nservants conceited, and that indulgence spoils them.--In Ireland, the\ncase is of the same nature, but much aggravated. The injury of having an\naristocracy of foreigners forced on the country, to whom the natives are\nto render service, is more recent, and the impression more consciously\nretained. The servants are ill-treated, and they yield bad service in\nreturn. It is mournful to see the arrangement of Dublin houses. The\ndrawing-rooms are palace-like, while the servants' apartments are dark\nand damp dungeons. It is wearisome to hear the complaints of the dirt,\nfalsehood, and faithlessness of Irish servants,--complaints which their\nmistresses have ever ready for the ear of the stranger; and it is\ndisgusting to witness the effects in the household. It is equally sad\nand ludicrous to see the mistress of some families enter the breakfast\nroom, with a loaf of bread under her arm, the butter-plate in one hand,\nand a bunch of keys in the other;--to see her cut from the loaf the\nnumber of slices required, and send them down to be toasted,--explaining\nthat she is obliged to lock up the very bread from the thievery of her\nservants, and informing against them as if she expected them to be\nworthy of trust, while she daily insults them with the refusal of all\ntrust,--even to the care of the bread-pan. In Scotland, the case is\nwidely different. Servitude and clanship are there connected, instead of\nservitude and conquest. The service is willing in proportion; and the\nfaults of domestics are not those common to the oppressed, but rather\nthose proceeding from pride and self-will. The Scotch domestic has still\nthe pride in the chief of the name which cherishes the self-respect of\nevery member of a clan; and in the service of the chief there is\nscarcely any exertion which the humblest of his name would not make. The\nresults are obvious. There is a better understanding between the two\nclasses than in the other divisions of the kingdom: and Scotch masters\nand mistresses obtain a satisfaction from their domestics which no\ndegree of justice and kindness in English and Irish housekeepers can\nsecure. The dregs of an oppression of centuries cannot be purged away by\nthe action of individual tempers, be they of the best. The causes of\nmisunderstanding, as we have said, lie deep.\n\nThe principles which regulate the condition of domestic servants in\nevery country form thus a deep and wide subject for the traveller's\ninquiries. In America, he will hear frequent complaints from the ladies\nof the pride of their maid servants, and of the difficulty of settling\nthem, while he sees that some are the most intimate friends of the\nfamilies they serve; and that not a few collect books, and attend\ncourses of scientific lectures. The fact is that, in America, a conflict\nis going on between opposite principles, and the consequences of the\nstruggle show themselves chiefly in the relation between master and\nservant. The old European notions of the degradation of servitude\nsurvive in the minds of their American descendants, and are nourished by\nthe presence of slavery on the same continent, and by the importation of\nlabourers from Europe which is perpetually going on. In conflict with\nthese notions are the democratic ideas of the honourableness of\nvoluntary service by contract. It is found difficult, at first, to\nsettle the bounds of the contract; and masters are liable to sin, from\nlong habit, on the side of imperiousness, and the servants on that of\ncaptiousness and jealousy of their own rights. Such are the\ninconveniences of a transition state;--a state, however, upon which it\nshould be remembered that other societies have yet to enter. In an Irish\ncountry-house, the guest sometimes finds himself desired to keep his\nwardrobe locked up.--In England, he perceives a restraint in the address\nof each class to the class above it.--In France, a washerwoman speaks\nwith as much ease to a duchess as a duchess to a washerwoman.--In\nHolland, the domestics have chambers as scrupulously neat as their\nmasters'.--In Ireland, they sleep in underground closets.--In New York,\nthey can command their own accommodation.--In Cuba they sleep, like\ndogs, in the passages of the family dwellings. These are some of the\nfacts from which the observer is to draw his inferences, rather than\nfrom the manners of some individuals of the class whom he may meet. In\nhis conclusions from such facts he can hardly be wrong, though he may\nchance to become acquainted with a footman of the true heroic order in\nDublin, and a master in Cuba who respects his own servants, and a\ncringing lackey in New York.\n\n * * * * *\n\nA point of some importance is whether the provincial inhabitants depend\nupon the management and imitate the modes of life of the metropolis, or\nhave principles and manners of their own. Where there is least freedom\nand the least desire of it, everything centres in the metropolis. Where\nthere is most freedom, each \"city, town, and vill,\" thinks and acts for\nitself. In despotic countries, the principle of centralization actuates\neverything. Orders are issued from the central authorities, and the\nminds of the provinces are saved all trouble of thinking for themselves.\nWhere self-government is permitted to each assemblage of citizens, they\nare stimulated to improve their idea and practice of liberty, and are\nalmost independent of metropolitan usages. The traveller will find that\n\"Paris is France,\" as everybody has heard, and that the government of\nFrance is carried on in half-a-dozen apartments in the capital, with\nlittle reference to the unrepresented thousands who are living some\nhundreds of miles off: while, if he casts a glance over Norway, he may\nsee the people on the shores of the fiords, or in the valleys between\nthe pine-steeps, quietly making their arrangements for controlling the\ncentral authority, even abolishing the institution of hereditary\nnobility in opposition to the will of the king; but legally, peaceably,\nand in all the simplicity of determined independence,--the result of a\nmatured idea of liberty. The observer will note whether the pursuits and\namusements of the provincial inhabitants originate in the circumstances\nof the locality, or whether they are copies from those of the\nmetropolis; whether the great city be spoken of with reverence, scorn,\nor indifference, or not spoken of at all: whether, as in a Pennsylvanian\nvillage, the society could go on if the capital were swallowed up by an\nearthquake; or whether, as in Prussia, the favour of the central power\nis as the breath of the nostrils of the people.\n\n * * * * *\n\nNewspapers are a strong evidence of the political ideas of a\npeople;--not individual newspapers; for no two, perhaps, fully agree in\nprinciples and sentiment, and it is to be feared that none are\npositively honest. Not by individual newspapers must the traveller form\nhis judgment, but by the freedom of discussion which he may find to be\npermitted, or the restraints upon discussion imposed. The idea of\nliberty must be low and feeble among a people who permit the government\nto maintain a severe censorship; and it must be powerful and effectual\nin a society which can make all its complaints through a newspaper,--be\nthe reports of the newspapers upon the state of social affairs as dismal\nas they may. Whatever revilings of a tyrannical president, or of a\nservile congress, a traveller may meet with in any number of American\njournals, he may fairly conclude that both the one and the other must\nbe nearly harmless if they are discussed in a newspaper. The very\nexistence of the newspapers he sees testifies to the prevalence of a\nhabit of reading, and consequently of education--to the wide diffusion\nof political power--and to the probable safety and permanence of a\ngovernment which is founded on so broad a basis, and can afford to\nindulge so large a licence. Whatever he may be told of the patriotism of\na sovereign, let him give it to the winds if he finds a space in a\nnewspaper made blank by the pen of a censor. The tameness of the\nAustrian journals tells as plain a tale as if no censor had ever\nsuppressed a syllable;--as much so as the small size of a New Orleans\npaper compared with one of New York, or as the fiercest bluster of a\nCincinnati Daily or Weekly, on the eve of the election of a president.\n\n * * * * *\n\nIn countries where there is any Free Education, the traveller must\nobserve its nature; and especially whether the subjects of it are\ndistinguished by any sort of badge. The practice of badging, otherwise\nthan by mutual consent, is usually bad: it is always suspicious. The\ntraveller will note whether free education is conferred by charitable\nbequest, (a practice originating in times when the doctrine of expiation\nwas prevalent, and continued to this day by its union with charity,) or\nwhether it is framed at the will of the sovereign, that his young\nsubjects may be trained to his own purposes,--as in the case of the\nEmperor of Russia and his young Polish victims; or whether it arises\nfrom the union of such a desire with a more enlightened object,--as may\nbe witnessed in Prussia; or whether it is provided by the sovereign\npeople,--by universal consent, as the right of every individual born\ninto the community, and as the necessary qualification for the enjoyment\nof social privileges,--as in the United States. The English Christ\nHospital boys are badged: Napoleon's Polytechnic pupils were badged; so\nare the Czar's orphan charge. Wherever the meddling or ostentatious\ncharity of antique times is in existence,--times when the idea of\nliberty was low and confined,--this badging is to be looked for; and\nalso wherever it is necessary to the purposes of the potentate to keep a\nregister of the young subjects who may become his instruments or his\nfoes:--but where education is absolutely universal, where any citizen\nhas a right to put every child, not otherwise educated, into the\nschool-house of his township, and where the rising generation are\ndestined to take care of themselves, and legislate after their own will,\nno badging will be found. This apparently trifling fact is worth the\nattention of the observer.\n\nThe extent of popular education is a fact of the deepest significance.\nUnder despotisms there will be the smallest amount of it; and in\nproportion to the national idea of the dignity and importance of\nman,--idea of liberty, in short,--will be its extent, both in regard to\nthe number it comprehends, and to the enlargement of their studies. The\nuniversality of education is inseparably connected with a lofty idea of\nliberty; and till the idea is realized in a constantly expanding system\nof national education, the observer may profitably note for reflection\nthe facts whether he is surrounded on a frontier by a crowd of whining\nyoung beggars, or whether he sees a parade of charity scholars,--these\nall in blue caps and yellow stockings, and those all in white tippets\nand green aprons; or whether he falls in with an annual or quarterly\nassembly of teachers, met to confer on the best principles and methods\nof carrying on an education which is itself a matter of course.\n\nIn countries where there is any popular Idea of Liberty, the\nuniversities are considered its stronghold, from their being the places\nwhere the young, active, hopeful, and aspiring meet,--the youths who are\nsoon to be citizens, and who have here the means of daily communication\nof their ideas, for many years together. It would be an interesting\ninquiry how many revolutions, warlike or bloodless, have issued from\nseats of learning; and yet more, how many have been planned for which\nthe existing powers, or the habits of society, have been too strong. If\nthe universities are not so constituted as to admit of this fostering of\nfree principles, they are pretty sure to retain the antique notions in\naccordance with which they were instituted, and to fall into the rear of\nsociety in morals and manners. It is the traveller's business to observe\nthe characteristics of these institutions, and to reflect whether they\nare likely to aid or to retard the progress of the nation in which they\nstand.\n\nThere are universities in almost every country; but they are as little\nlike one another as the costumes that are found in Switzerland and\nIndia; and the one speak as plainly of morals and manners as the other\nof climate. It is needless to point out that countries which contain\nonly aristocratic halls of learning, or schools otherwise devoid of an\nelastic principle, must be in a state of comparative barbarism; because,\nin such a case, learning (so called there) must be confined to a few,\nand probably to the few who can make the least practical use of it.\nWhere the universities are on such a plan as that, preserving their\nprimary form, they can admit increasing numbers, the state of intellect\nis likely to be a more advanced one. But a more favourable symptom is\nwhere seats of learning are multiplied as society enlarges, modified in\ntheir principles as new departments of knowledge open, and as new\nclasses arise who wish to learn. That country is in a state of\ntransition--of progression--where the ancient universities are honoured\nfor as much as they can give, while new schools arise to supply their\ndeficiencies, and Mechanics' Institutes, or some kindred establishments,\nflourish by the side of both. This state of things, this variety in the\npursuit of knowledge, can exist only where there is a freedom of\nthought, and consequent diversity of opinion, which argues a vigorous\nidea of liberty.\n\nThe observer must not, however, rest satisfied with ascertaining the\nproportion of the means of education to the people who have to be\neducated. He must mark the objects for which learning is pursued. The\ntwo most strongly contrasted cases which can be found are probably those\nof Germany and (once more) the United States. In the United States, it\nis well known, a provision of university education is made as ample as\nthat of schools for an earlier stage; yet no one pretends that a highly\nfinished education is to be looked for in that country. The cause is\nobvious. In a young nation, the great common objects of life are entered\nupon earlier, and every preparatory process is gone through in a more\nsuperficial manner. Seats of learning are numerous and fully attended,\nboth in Germany and America, and they testify in each to a pervading\ndesire of knowledge. Here the agreement ends. The German student may,\nwithout being singular, remain within the walls of his college till time\nsilvers his hairs; or he has even been known to pass eighteen years\namong his books, without once crossing the threshold of his study. The\nyoung American, meanwhile, satisfied at the end of three years that he\nknows as much as his neighbours, settles in a home, engages in farming\nor commerce, and plunges into what alone he considers the business of\nlife. Each of these pursues his appropriate objects: each is right in\nhis own way: but the difference of pursuit indicates a wider difference\nof sentiment between the two countries than the abundance of the means\nof learning in each indicates a resemblance. The observer must therefore\nmark, not only what and how many are the seats of learning, but who\nfrequent them; whether there are many, past the season of youth, who\nmake study the business of their lives; or whether all are of that class\nwho regard study merely as a part of the preparation which they are\nordained to make for the accomplishment of the commonest aims of life.\nHe can scarcely take his evening walk in the precincts of a university\nwithout observing a difference so wide as this.\n\nThe great importance of the fact lies in this,--that increase of\nknowledge is necessary to the secure enlargement of freedom. Germany may\nnot, it is true, require learning in her youth for political purposes,\nbut because learning has become the taste, the characteristic honour of\nthe nation; but this knowledge will infallibly work out, sooner or\nlater, her political regeneration. America requires knowledge in her\nsons because her political existence itself depends upon their mental\ncompetency. The two countries will probably approximate gradually\ntowards a sympathy which is at present out of the question. As America\nbecomes more fully peopled, a literature will grow up within her, and\nstudy will assume its place among the chief objects of life. The great\nideas which are the employment of the best minds of Germany must work\ntheir way out into action; and new and immediately practical kinds of\nknowledge will mingle themselves, more and more largely, with those to\nwhich she has been, in times past, devoted. The two countries may thus\nfall into a sympathetic correspondence on the mighty subjects of human\ngovernment and human learning, and the grand idea of liberty may be made\nmore manifest in the one, and disciplined and enriched in the other.\n\n * * * * *\n\nOne great subject of observation and speculation remains--the objects\nand form of Persecution for Opinion in each country. Persecution for\nopinion is always going on among a people enlightened enough to\nentertain any opinions at all. There must always be, in such a nation,\nsome who have gone further in research than others, and who, in making\nsuch an advance, have overstepped the boundaries of popular sympathy.\nThe existence and sufferings of such are not to be denied because there\nare no fires at the stake, and no organized and authorized Inquisition,\nand because formal excommunication is gone out of fashion. Persecution\nputs on other forms as ages elapse; but it is not extinct. It can be\ninflicted out of the province of law, as well as through it; by a\nneighbourhood as well as from the Vatican. A wise and honest man may be\nwounded through his social affections, and in his domestic relations, as\neffectually as by flames, fetters, and public ignominy. There are wise\nand good persons in every civilized country, who are undergoing\npersecution in one form or another every day.\n\nIs it for precocity in science? or for certain opinions in politics? or\nfor a peculiar mode of belief in the Christian religion, or unbelief of\nit? or for championship of an oppressed class? or for new views in\nmorals? or, for fresh inventions in the arts, apparently interfering\nwith old-established interests? or for bold philosophical speculation?\nWho suffers arbitrary infliction, in short, and how, for any mode of\nthinking, and of faithful action upon thought? An observer would reject\nwhatever he might be told of the paternal government of a prince, if he\nsaw upon a height a fortress in which men were suffering _carcere duro_\nfor political opinions. In like manner, whatever a nation may tell him\nof its love of liberty should go for little if he sees a virtuous man's\nchildren taken from him on the ground of his holding an unusual\nreligious belief; or citizens mobbed for asserting the rights of\nnegroes; or moralists treated with public scorn for carrying out allowed\nprinciples to their ultimate issues; or scholars oppressed for throwing\nnew light into the sacred text; or philosophers denounced for bringing\nfresh facts to the surface of human knowledge, whether they seem to\nagree or not with long-established suppositions.\n\nThe kind and degree of infliction for opinion which is possible, and is\npractised in the time and place, will indicate to the observer the\ndegree of imperfection in the popular idea of liberty. This is a kind of\nfact easy to ascertain, and worthy of all attention.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nPROGRESS.\n\n \"'Tis the sublime of man,\n Our noontide majesty, to know ourselves\n Parts and proportions of one wondrous whole!\n This fraternizes man, this constitutes\n Our charities and bearings.\"\n COLERIDGE.\n\n \"Then let us pray that come it may,\n As come it will for a' that,\n That sense and worth, o'er a' the earth,\n May bear the gree, and a' that.\n For a' that, and a' that,\n It's coming yet, for a' that,\n That man to man, the warld o'er,\n Shall brothers be for a' that.\"\n BURNS.\n\nHowever widely men may differ as to the way to social perfection, all\nwhose minds have turned in that direction agree as to the end. All agree\nthat if the whole race could live as brethren, society would be in the\nmost advanced state that can be conceived of. It is also agreed that the\nspirit of fraternity is to be attained, if at all, by men discerning\ntheir mutual relation, as \"parts and proportions of one wondrous whole.\"\nThe disputes which arise are about how these proportions are to be\narranged, and what those qualifications should be by which some shall\nhave an ascendancy over others.\n\nThis cluster of questions is not yet settled with regard to the\ninhabitants of any one country. The most advanced nations are now in a\ncondition of internal conflict upon them. As for the larger idea,--that\nnations as well as individuals are \"parts and proportions of one\nwondrous whole,\" it has hardly yet passed the lips or pen of any but\nreligious men and poets. Its time will come when men have made greater\nprogress, and are more at ease about the domestic arrangements of\nnations. As long as there are, in every country of the world, multitudes\nwho cannot by any exertion of their own redeem themselves from hardship,\nand their children from ignorance, there is quite enough for justice and\ncharity to do at home. While this is doing,--while the English are\nstriving to raise the indigent classes of their society, the French\nspeculating to elevate the condition of woman, and to open the career of\nlife to all rational beings, the Germans waiting to throw off the\ndespotism of absolute rulers, and the Americans struggling to free the\nnegroes,--the fraternal sentiment will be growing, in preparation for\nyet higher results. The principle, acted upon at home, will be gaining\nstrength for exercise abroad; and the more any society becomes like a\nband of brothers, the more powerful must be the sympathy which it will\nhave to offer to other such bands.\n\nFar off as may be the realization of such a prospect, it is a prospect.\nFor many ages poets and philosophers have entertained the idea of a\ngeneral spirit of fraternity among men. It is the one great principle of\nthe greatest religion which has ever nourished the morals of mankind.\nIt is the loftiest hope on which the wisest speculators have lived.\nPoets are the prophets, and philosophers the analysers of the fate of\nmen, and religion is the promise and pledge of unseen powers to those\nwho believe in them. That cannot be unworthy of attention, of hope, of\nexpectation, which the poets and the analysers of the race, have reposed\nupon, and on which the best religion of the world (and that which\ncomprehends all others) is based. That which has never, for all its\nsplendour, been deemed absurd by the wisest of the race is now beginning\nto be realized. We have now something more to show for our hope than\nwhat was before enough for the highest minds. The fraternal spirit has\nbegun to manifest itself by its workings in society. The helpless are\nnow aided expressly on the ground of their helplessness,--not from the\nemotions of compassion excited by the spectacle of suffering in\nparticular cases, but in a nobler and more abstract way. Classes,\ncrowds, nations of sufferers are aided and protected by strangers,\npowerful and at ease, who never saw an individual of the suffering\nthousands, and who have none but a spiritual interest in their welfare.\nSince missions to barbarous countries, action against slavery, and the\ncare of the blind, deaf and dumb, and paupers, have become labours of\nsociety, the fraternity of men has ceased to be a mere aspiration, or\neven prophecy and promise. It is not only that the high-placed watchmen\nof the world have announced that the day is coming,--it has dawned; and\nthere is every reason to expect that it will brighten into noon.\n\nThe traveller must be strangely careless who, in observing upon the\nmorals of a people, omits to mark the manifestations of this\nprinciple;--to learn what is its present strength, and what the promise\nof its growth. By fixing his observation on this he may learn, and no\notherwise can he learn, whether the country he studies is advancing in\nwisdom and happiness, or whether it is stationary, or whether it is\ngoing back. The probabilities of its progress are wholly dependent upon\nthis.--It will not take long to point out what are the signs of\nprogression which he must study.\n\n * * * * *\n\nIt is of great consequence whether the nation is insular or continental,\nindependent or colonial. Though the time seems to be come when the sea\nis to be made a highway, as easy of passage as the land, such has not\nbeen the case till now. Even in the case of Great Britain,--the most\naccessible of islands, and the most tempting to access,--before the last\nseries of wars, a much smaller number of strangers visited her than\ncould have been supposed to come if they had only to pass land\nfrontiers. During the wars, she was almost excluded from continental\nsociety. The progress that her people have made in liberality and\nhumanity since communication has been rendered easy, is so striking that\nit is impossible to avoid supposing the enlarged commerce of mind which\nhas taken place to be one of the chief causes of the improvement. It is\nprobable that the advancement of the nation would have been still\ngreater if the old geological state of junction with the continent had\nbeen restored for the last twenty years. She would then have been\nalmost such a centre of influx as France has been, and by which France\nhas so far profited that the French are now, it is believed, the most\nactive-minded and morally progressive nation in the world. Much of the\nvigour and progression of France is doubtless owing to other causes; but\nmuch also to her rapid and extensive intercourse with the minds of many\nnations. The condition of the inhabitants of other islands is likely to\nbe less favourable to progression than that of the British, in\nproportion as they have less intercourse. They are likely to have even\nmore than the English proportion of self-satisfaction, dislike of\nforeigners, and reserve. Generally speaking, the inhabitants of islands\nare found to be to those of continental countries as villagers to\ncitizens: they have good qualities of their own, but are behind the\nworld. Malta has not the chance that she would have if we could annex\nher to the South of France; nor will the West India islands advance as\nthey would do if we could throw them all into one, and intersect the\nwhole with roads leading on either side from the great European and\nAmerican cities.\n\nMalta and the West India islands have, however, the additional\ndisadvantage of being colonies. The moral progression of a people can\nscarcely begin till they are independent. Their morals are overruled by\nthe mother-country,--by the government and legislation she imposes, by\nthe rulers she sends out, by the nature of the advantages she grants and\nthe tribute she requires, by the population she pours in from home, and\nby her own example. Accordingly, the colonies of a powerful country\nexhibit an exaggeration of the national faults, with only infant\nvirtues of their own, which wait for freedom to grow to maturity, and\namong which an enlarged sympathy with the race is seldom found. This is\na temper uncongenial with a confined, dependent, and imitative society;\nand the first strong symptoms of it are usually found in the persons of\nthose whose mission it is to lead the colony out of its minority into\nindependence.\n\nThese are conditions of a people which may guide the traveller's\nobservations by showing him what to expect. Remembering these\nconditions, he will mark the greater or less enlargement and generosity\nof the spirit of society, and learn from these the fact or promise of\nprogression, or whether it is too soon to look for either.\n\nThere is another important condition which can hardly escape his notice:\nwhether the people are homogeneous or composed of various races. The\ninhabitants of New England are a remarkable specimen of the first, as\nthe inhabitants of the middle states of America will be of the last, two\nor three generations hence. Almost all the nations of Europe are\nmongrel; and those which can trace their descent from the greatest\nvariety of ancestors have, other circumstances remaining the same, the\nbest chance of progression. Among a homogeneous people, ancestral\nvirtues flourish; but these carry with them ancestral faults as their\nshadow; and there is a liability of a new fault being added,--resistance\nto the spirit of improvement. If the chances of severity of ancient\nvirtue are lessened in the case of a mongrel people, there is a\ncounterbalancing advantage in the greater diversity of interests,\nenlargement of sympathy, and vigour of enterprise introduced by the\nclose union of the descendants of different races. The people of New\nEngland, almost to a man descended from the pilgrim fathers, have the\nstrong religious principle and feeling, the uprightness, the domestic\nattachment, and the principled worldly prudence of their ancestors, with\nmuch of their asceticism (and necessarily attendant cant) and bigotry.\nTheir neighbours in the middle states are composed of contributions from\nall countries of the civilized world, and have, as yet, no distinctive\ncharacter; but it is probable that a very valuable one will be formed,\nin course of time, from such elements as the genial gaiety of the\ncavaliers, the patient industry of the Germans and Dutch, the vivacity\nof the French, the sobriety of the Scotch, the enterprise of the Irish,\nand the domestic tastes of the Swiss,--all of which, with their\nattendant drawbacks, go to compose the future American character. The\nchief pride of the New Englanders is in their unmixed descent;--a\nvirtuous pride, but not the most favourable to a progression which must\nantiquate some of the qualities to which they are most attached. The\nEuropean components of the other population cherish some of the feudal\nprejudices and the territorial pride which they imported with them, and\nthis is their peculiar drawback: but it appears that the enlarged\nliberality which they enjoy from being intermingled more than\ncountervails the religious spirit of New England in opening the general\nheart and mind to the interests of the race at large. The progression of\nthe middle states seems likely to be more rapid than that of New\nEngland, though the inhabitants of the northern states have hitherto\ntaken and kept the lead.\n\nIt is the traveller's business to enter upon this course of observation\nwherever he goes. When he has ascertained the conditions under which the\nnational character is forming,--whether its situation is insular or\ncontinental, colonial or independent, and whether it is descended from\none race or more, he will proceed to observe the facts which indicate\nprogress or the reverse.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThe most obvious of these facts is the character of charity. Charity is\neverywhere. The human heart is always tender, always touched by visible\nsuffering, under one form or another. The form which this charity takes\nis the great question.\n\nIn young and rude countries, an open-handed charity pervades the land.\nEveryone who comes in want to a dwelling has his immediate want\nrelieved. The Arab gives from his mess to the hungerer who appears at\nthe entrance of his tent. The negro brings rice and milk to the\ntraveller who lies fainting under the palm. The poor are fed round\nconvent-doors, morning and evening, where there are convents. In\nIreland, it is a common practice to beg, in order to rise in the\nworld,--a clear testimony to the practice of charity there. In all\nsocieties, the poor help the poorer; the depressed class aids the\ndestitute. The existence of the charity may be considered a certainty.\nThe inquiry is about its direction.\n\nThe lowest order of charity is that which is satisfied with relieving\nthe immediate pressure of distress in individual cases. A higher is that\nwhich makes provision on a large scale for the relief of such distress;\nas when a nation passes on from common alms-giving to a general\nprovision for the destitute. A higher still is when such provision is\nmade in the way of anticipation, or for distant objects; as when the\ncivilization of savages, the freeing of slaves, the treatment of the\ninsane, or the education of the blind and deaf mutes is undertaken. The\nhighest charity of all is that which aims at the prevention rather than\nthe alleviation of evil. When any considerable number of a society are\nengaged in this work, the spirit of fraternity is busy there, and the\nprogression of the society is ascertained. In such a community, it is\nallowed that though it is good to relieve the hungry, it is better to\ntake care that all who work shall eat, as a matter of right: that though\nit is good to provide for the comfort and reformation of the guilty, it\nis better to obviate guilt: that though it is good to teach the ignorant\nwho come in one's way, it is better to provide the means of knowledge,\nas of food, for all. In short, it is a nobler charity to prevent\ndestitution, crime, and ignorance, than to relieve individuals who never\nought to have been made destitute, criminal, and ignorant.\n\nThis war against the evils themselves, in preference to, but accompanied\nby, relief of the victims, has begun in many countries; and those which\nare the most busily occupied in the work must be considered the most\nadvanced, and the most certain to advance. The observer must note the\nstate of the work everywhere. In one country he will see the poor fed\nand clothed by charity, without any effort being made to relieve them\nfrom the pressure by which they are sunk in destitution. The spirit of\nbrotherhood is not there; and such charity has nothing of the spirit of\nhope and progress in it. In another country, he will see the independent\ninsisting on the right of the destitute to relief, and providing by law\nor custom for such relief. This is a great step, inasmuch as the\ninterests of the helpless are taken up by the powerful,--a movement\nwhich must have something of the fraternal spirit for its impulse. In a\nthird, he hears of prison discipline societies, missionary societies,\ntemperance societies, and societies for the abolition of slavery. This\nis better still. It is looking wide,--so wide as that the spirit of\ncharity acts as seeing the invisible,--the pagan trembling under the\ntabu, the negro outraged in his best affections, and the criminal hidden\nin the foul retreat of the common jail. It is also a training for\nlooking deep; for these methods of charity all go to prevent the woes of\nfuture heathen generations, future slaves, drunkards, and criminals, as\nwell as to soften the lot of those who exist. If, in a fourth society,\nthe observer finds that the charity has gone deep as well as spread\nwide, and that the benevolent are tugging at the roots of indigence and\ncrime, he may place this society above all the rest as to the brightness\nof its prospects. Such a movement can proceed only from the spirit of\nfraternity,--from the movers feeling it their own concern that any are\ndepressed and endangered as they would themselves refuse to be. The\nelevation of the depressed classes in such a society, and the consequent\nprogression of the whole, may be considered certain; for \"sooner will\nthe mother forget her sucking child\" than the friends of their race\nforsake those for whom they have cared and laboured with disinterested\nlove and toil. Criminals will never be plunged back into their former\nstate in America, nor women in France, nor negroes in the colonies of\nEngland. The spirit of justice (which is ultimately one with charity)\nhas gone forth, not only conquering, but still to conquer.\n\nTo the prospects of the sufferers of society let the observer look; and\nhe will discern the prospects of the society itself.\n\n * * * * *\n\nUseful arts and inventions spread so rapidly in these days of improving\ncommunication, that they are no longer the decisive marks of\nenlightenment in a people that they were when each nation had the\nbenefit of its own discoveries, and little more. Yet it is worthy of\nremark what kinds of improvement are the most generally adopted; whether\nthose which enhance the luxury of the rich, or such as benefit the whole\nsociety. It is worthy of remark whether the newest delight is in\nsplendid club-houses, where gentlemen may command the rarest luxuries at\na smaller expense than would have been possible without the aid of the\nprinciple of economy of association, or in the groups of mechanics'\ndwellings, where the same principle is applied in France to furnishing\nnumbers with advantages of warmth, light, cookery, and cleanliness,\nwhich they could no otherwise have enjoyed. It is worth observing\nwhether there are most mechanical inventions dedicated to the\nselfishness of the rich, or committed to the custom of the working\nclasses. If the rich compose the great body of purchasers who are to be\nconsidered by inventors, the working classes are probably depressed. If\nthere are most purchasers among the most numerous classes, the working\norder is rising, and the state of things is hopeful.--How speed the\ngreat discoveries and achievements which cannot, by any management, be\nconfined to the few? How prospers the steam-engine, the\nrail-road,--strong hands which cannot be held back, by which a multitude\nof the comforts of life are extended to the poor, who could not reach up\nto them before? Do men glory most in the activity of these, or in the\ninvention of a new pleasure for the satiated?\n\nIn the finer arts, for whom are heads and hands employed? The study of\nthe ruins of all old countries tells the antiquary of the lives of the\nrich alone. There are churches which record the living piety or the\ndying penitence of the rich; priories and convents which speak of\nmonkish idleness, and the gross luxuries which have cloaked themselves\nin asceticism; there are palaces of kings, castles of nobles, and villas\nof opulent commoners; but nowhere, except in countries recently\ndesolated by war, are the relics of the abodes of the poor the study of\nthe traveller. If he now finds skill bestowed on the buildings which are\nthe exclusive resort of the labouring classes, and taste employed in\ntheir embellishment, it is clear that the order is rising. The record of\neach upward heave will remain for the observation of the future\ntraveller, in the buildings to which they resort;--a record as\nindisputable as a mountain fissure presents to the geologist.\n\nTime was when the dwellings of the opulent were ornamented with costly\nand beautiful works of art, while the eye of the peasant and the artisan\nfound no other beauty to rest on than the face of his beloved, and the\nforms of his children. At this day, there are countries in Europe where\nthe working man aspires to nothing more than to stick up an image of the\nVirgin, gay with coloured paper, in a corner of his dwelling. But there\nare other lands where a higher taste for beauty is gratified. There are\ngood prints provided cheap, to hang in the place of the ancient sampler\nor daub. Casts from all the finest works of the statuary, ancient and\nmodern, are hawked about the streets, and may be seen in the windows\nwhere green parrots and brown cats in plaster used to annoy the eye. In\nsocieties where the working class is thus worked for, in the\ngratification of its finer tastes, the class must be rising. It is\nrising into the region of intellectual luxury, and must have been borne\nup thither by the expansion of the fraternal spirit.\n\n * * * * *\n\nThe great means of progress, for individuals, for nations, and for the\nrace at large, is the multiplication of Objects of interest. The\nindulgence of the passions is the characteristic of men and societies\nwho have but one occupation and a single interest; while the passions\ncause comparatively little trouble where the intellect is active, and\nthe life diversified with objects. Pride takes a safe direction,\njealousy is diverted from its purposes of revenge, and anger combats\nwith circumstances, instead of with human foes. The need of mutual aid,\nthe habit of co-operation caused by interest in social objects, has a\ngood effect upon men's feelings and manners towards each other; and out\nof this grows the mutual regard which naturally strengthens into the\nfraternal spirit. The Russian boor, imprisoned in his serfhood, cannot\ncomprehend what it is to care for any but the few individuals who are\nbefore his eyes, and the Grand Lama has probably no great sympathy with\nthe race; but in a town within whose compass almost all occupations are\ngoing forward, and where each feels more or less interest in what\nengages his neighbour, nothing of importance to the race can become\nknown without producing more or less emotion. A famine in India, an\nearthquake in Syria, causes sorrow. The inhabitants meet to petition\nagainst the wrongs inflicted on people whom they have never seen, and\ngive of the fruits of their labour to sufferers who have never heard of\nthem, and from whom they can receive no return of acknowledgment. It is\nfound that the more pursuits and aims are multiplied, the more does the\nappreciation of human happiness expand, till it becomes the interest\nwhich predominates over all the rest. This is an interest which works\nout its own gratification, more surely than any other. Wherever,\ntherefore, the greatest variety of pursuits is met with, it is fair to\nconclude that the fraternal spirit of society is the most vigorous, and\nthe society itself the most progressive.\n\nThis is as far as any nation has as yet attained,--to a warmer than\ncommon sympathy among its own members, and compassion for distant\nsufferers. When the time comes for nations to care for one another, and\nco-operate as individuals, such a people will be the first to hold out\nthe right hand.\n\n * * * * *\n\nManners have not been treated of separately from Morals in any of the\npreceding divisions of the objects of the traveller's observation. The\nreason is, that manners are inseparable from morals, or, at least, cease\nto have meaning when separated. Except as manifestations of morals, they\nhave no interest, and can have no permanent existence. A traveller who\nshould report of them exclusively is not only no philosopher, but does\nnot merit the name of an observer; for he can have no insight into the\nmatter which he professes to convey an account of. His interpretation of\nwhat is before his eyes is more likely to be wrong than correct, like\nthat of the primitive star-gazers, who reported that the planets went\nbackwards and forwards in the sky. To him, and to him only, who has\nstudied the principles of morals, and thus possessed himself of a key to\nthe mysteries of all social weal and woe, will manners be an index\nanswering as faithfully to the internal movements, harmonious or\ndiscordant, of society, as the human countenance to the workings of the\nhuman heart.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nDISCOURSE.\n\n \"He that questioneth much shall learn much, and content much;\n but especially if he apply his questions to the skill of the\n persons whom he asketh; for he shall give them occasion to\n please themselves in speaking, and himself shall continually\n gather knowledge.\"\n _Bacon._\n\nThe Discourse of individuals is an indispensable commentary upon the\nclasses of national facts which the traveller has observed. To begin the\nwork of observation with registering this private discourse, is, as has\nbeen said, useless, from the diversity that there is in men's minds, and\nfrom the narrowness of the mental vision of each as he stands in a\ncrowd. The testimony of no two would be found to agree; and, if the\ntraveller depended upon them for his general facts, he could never\nfurnish a record which could be trusted. But, the facts being once\nobtained by stronger evidence than individual testimony,--certain fixed\npoints being provided round which testimony may gather,--the discourse\nof individuals assumes its proper value, and becomes illustrative where\nbefore it would have been only bewildering. The traveller must obtain\nall that he can of it. He must seek intercourse with all classes of the\nsociety he visits,--not only the rich and the poor, but those who may be\nclassed by profession, pursuit, habits of mind, and turn of manners. He\nmust converse with young men and maidens, old men and children, beggars\nand savans, postillions and potentates. He must study little ones at\ntheir mothers' knees, and flirtations in ball-rooms, and dealings in the\nmarket-place. He must overhear the mirth of revellers, and the grief of\nmourners. Wherever there is speech, he must devote himself to hear.\n\nOne way in which discourse serves as a commentary upon the things he has\nobserved is in the exhibition of certain general characters of its own,\nwhich are accordant with the general facts he has registered. The\nconversation of almost every nation has its characteristics, like that\nof smaller societies. The style of discourse in an English village is\nunlike that of a populous town; and the people of a town which is no\nthoroughfare talk differently from the inhabitants of one which is. In\nthe same way is the general discourse of a whole people modified. In one\ncountry less regard is paid to truth in particulars, to circumstantial\naccuracy, than in another. One nation has more sincerity; another more\nkindliness in speech. One proses; another is light and sportive. One is\nfrank; another reserved. One flatters the stranger; another is careless\nof him: and the discourse of the one is designed to produce a certain\neffect upon him; while that of the other flows out spontaneously, or is\nrestrained, according to the traveller's own apparent humour. Such\ncharacteristics of the general discourse may be noted as a\ncorroboration of suppositions drawn from other facts. They may be taken\nas evidence of the respective societies being catholic or puritanic in\nspirit; crude or accomplished; free and simple, or restrained and\ncautious; self-satisfied, or deficient in self-respect. The observer\nmust be very careful not to generalize too hastily upon the discourse\naddressed to him; but there are everywhere large conclusions which he\ncannot help making. However wide the variety of individuals with whom he\nmay converse, it is scarcely likely that he will meet in Spain with any\nnumber who will prose like the Americans; or in Germany with many who\nwill treat him with the light jests of the French. Such general\ntendencies of any society as he may have been informed of by the study\nof things, he will find evidenced also by the general character of its\ndiscourse.\n\nAnother way in which discourse serves as a commentary, is by showing\nwhat interests the people most. If the observer goes with a free mind\nand an open heart, not full of notions and feelings of his own, but\nready to resign himself to those of the people he visits,--if he commits\nhimself to his sympathies, and makes himself one with those about him,\nhe cannot but presently discover and appreciate what interests them\nmost.\n\nA high Tory in America will be more misled than enlightened by what is\nsaid to him, and so will a bigoted Republican in England. A prim Quaker\nwill not understand the French from half a year of Parisian\nconversation, any more than a mere dandy would feel at home at Jena or\nHeidelberg. But a traveller free from gross prejudice and selfishness\ncan hardly be many days in a new society without learning what are its\nchief interests. Even savages would speak to him of the figure-head of\ntheir canoe; and others would go through, in time, each its own range of\ntopics, till the German had poured out to him his philosophical views,\nand the Frenchman his solicitudes for the amelioration of society, and\nthe American his patriotic aspirations, and the Swiss his domestic\nsentiment. Whatever may be the restrictions imposed by rulers upon\ndiscourse, whatever may be the penalties imposed upon particular kinds\nof communication, all are unavailing in the presence of sympathy. At its\ntouch the abundance of the heart will gush out at the lips. Men are so\nmade that they cannot but speak of what interests them most to those who\nmost share the interest. This is a decree of nature by which the decrees\nof despots are annulled. The power of a ruler may avail to keep an\nobserver on his own side the frontier; but, if he has once passed it, it\nis his own fault if he does not become as well acquainted with the\nprevailing sentiment of the inhabitants, amidst the deadest public\nsilence, as if it were shouted out to the four winds. If he carries a\nsimple mind and an open heart, there is no mine in Siberia so deep but\nthe voice of complaint will come up to him from it, and no home so\nwatched by priests but that he will know what is concealed from the\nconfessor. All this would do little more than mislead him by means of\nhis sympathies, if such confidence were his only means of knowledge;\nbut, coming in corroboration of what he has learned in the large\nelsewhere, it becomes unquestionable evidence of what it is that\ninterests the people most.\n\nHe must bear in mind that there are a few universal interests which\neverywhere stand first, and that it is the modification of these by\nlocal influences which he has to observe; and also what comes next in\norder to these. For instance, the domestic are the primary interests\namong all human beings. It is so where the New England father dismisses\nhis sons to the West,--and where the Hindoo mother deserts her infants\nto seek the shade of her husband through the fire,--and where the\nSpanish parent consigns her youngest to the convent,--as truly as where\nthe Norwegian peasant enlarges his roof to admit another and another\nfamily of his descendants. It is for the traveller to trust the words\nand tones of parental love which meet his ear in every home of every\nland; and to mark by what it is that this prime and universal interest\nis modified, so as to produce such sacrifice of itself. Taking the\naffection for granted, which the private discourse of parents and\nchildren compels him to do, what light does he find cast upon the\ninfluence of the priests here, and pride of territory there;--upon the\nsuperstition which is the weakness of one people, and the social\nambition in the midst of poverty which is the curse of another!\n\nHe must also find out from the conversation of the people he visits what\nis their particular interest, from observing what ranks next to those\nwhich are universal. In one country, parents love their families first,\nand wealth next; in another, their families first, and glory next; in a\nthird, their families first, and liberty next; and so on, through the\nwhole range of objects of human desire. Once having discerned the mode,\nhe will find it easy to take the suffrage without much danger of\nmistake.\n\nThe chief reason why the discourse of individuals, apart from the\nobservation of classes of facts, is almost purely deceptive as to\nmorals, is that the traveller can see no more than one in fifty thousand\nof the people, and has no security that those he meets are a sample of\nthe whole. This difficulty does not interfere with one very important\nadvantage which he may obtain from conversation,--knowledge of and light\nupon particular questions. A stranger might wish to learn the state of\nChristianity in England. If he came to London, and began with\nconversation, he might meet a Church-of-England-man one day, a Catholic\nthe next, a Presbyterian the third, a Quaker the fourth, a Methodist the\nfifth, and so on, till the result was pure bewilderment. But if he\nconversed with intelligent persons, he would find that questions were\npending respecting the church and dissent,--involving the very\nprinciples of the administration of religion. The opinions he hears upon\nthese questions may be as various as the persons he converses with. He\nmay be unable to learn the true characters of the statesmen and\nreligious leaders concerned in their management: but he gains something\nof more value. Light is thrown upon the state of things from which alone\nthese questions could have arisen. From free newspapers he might have\nlearned the nature of the controversy; but in social intercourse much\nmore is presented to him. He sees the array of opinions marshalled on\neach side, or on all the sides of the question; and receives an\ninfinite number of suggestions and illustrations which could never have\nreached him but from the conflict of intellects, and the diversity of\nviews and statements with which he is entertained in discourse. The\ntraveller in every country should thus welcome the discussion of\nquestions in which the inhabitants are interested, taking strenuous care\nto hear the statements of every party. From the intimate connexion of\ncertain modes of opinion with all great questions, he will gain light\nupon the whole condition of opinion from its exhibition in one case. New\nsubjects of research will be brought within his reach; new paths of\ninquiry will be opened; new trains of ideas will be awakened, and fresh\nminds brought into communication with his own. If he can secure the good\nfortune of conversing with the leaders on both sides of great\nquestions,--with the men who have made it a pursuit to collect all the\nfacts of the case, and to follow out its principles,--there is no\nestimating his advantage. There is, perhaps, scarcely one great subject\nof national controversy which, thus opened to him, would not afford him\nglimpses into all the other general affairs of the day; and each time\nthat his mind grasps a definite opposition of popular opinion, he has\naccomplished a stage in his pilgrimage of inquiry into the tendencies of\na national mind. He will therefore be anxious to engage all he meets in\nfull and free conversation on prevailing topics, leaving it to them to\nopen their minds in their own way, and only taking care of his\nown,--that he preserves his impartiality, and does no injustice to\nquestion or persons by bias of his own.\n\nIn arranging his plans for conversing with all kinds of people, the\nobserver will not omit to cultivate especially the acquaintance of\npersons who themselves see the most of society. The value of their\ntestimony on particular points must depend much on that of their minds\nand characters; but, from the very fact of their having transactions\nwith a large portion of society, they cannot avoid affording many lights\nto a stranger which he could obtain by no other means. The conversation\nof lawyers in a free country, of physicians, of merchants and\nmanufacturers in central trading situations, of innkeepers and of\nbarbers everywhere, must yield him much which he could not have\ncollected for himself. The minds of a great variety of people are daily\nacting upon the thoughts of such, and the facts of a great variety of\nlives upon their experience; and whether they be more or less wise in\nthe use of their opportunities, they must be unlike what they would have\nbeen in a state of seclusion. If the stranger listens to what they are\nmost willing to tell, he may learn much of popular modes of thinking and\nfeeling, of modes of living, acting, and transacting, which will confirm\nand illustrate impressions and ideas which he had previously gained from\nother sources.\n\nThe result of the whole of what he hears will probably be to the\ntraveller of the same kind with that which the journey of life yields to\nthe wisest of its pilgrims. As he proceeds, he will learn to condemn\nless, and to admire, not less, but differently. He will find no\nintellect infallible, no judgment free from prejudice, and therefore no\naffections without their bias; but, on the other hand, he will find no\nerror which does not branch out of some truth; no wrath which has not\nsome reason in it; nothing wrong which is not the perversion of\nsomething right; no wickedness that is not weakness. If he is compelled\nto give up the adoration of individuals, the man-worship which is the\nreligion of young days, he surrenders with it the spirit of contempt\nwhich ought also to be proper to youth. To a healthy mind it is\nimpossible to mix largely with men, under a variety of circumstances,\nand wholly to despise either societies or individuals; so magnificent is\nthe intellect of men in combination, so universal are their most\nprivately nourished affections. He must deny himself the repose of\nimplicit faith in the intellect of any one; but he cannot refuse the\nluxury of trust in the moral power of the whole. Instead of the complete\nset of dogmas with which he was perhaps once furnished, on the authority\nof a few individuals, he brings home a store of learning on the great\nsubject of human prejudices: but he cannot have watched the vast effects\nof a community of sentiment,--he cannot have observed multitudes\ntranquillized into social order, stimulated to social duty, and even\nimpelled to philanthropic self-sacrifice, without being convinced that\nmen were made to live in a bond of brotherhood. He cannot have sat in\nconversation under the village elm, or in sunny vineyards, or by the\nembers of the midnight fire, without knowing how spirit is formed to\nunfold itself to spirit; and how, when the solitary is set in families,\nhis sympathies bind him to them by such a chain as selfish interest\nnever yet wove. He cannot have travelled wisely and well without being\nconvinced that moral power is the force which lifts man to be not only\nlord of the earth, but scarcely below the angels; and that the higher\nspecies of moral power, which are likely to come more and more into\nuse, clothe him in a kind of divinity to which angels themselves might\nbow.--No one will doubt this who has been admitted into that range of\nsanctuaries, the homes of nations; and who has witnessed the godlike\nachievements of the servants, sages, and martyrs, who have existed\nwherever man has been.\n\nPART III.\n\nMECHANICAL METHODS.\n\n \"In sea-voyages, where there is nothing to be seen but sky and\n sea, men make diaries; but in land-travel, wherein so much is to\n be observed, they omit it.\"--BACON.\n\n \"Stick to your journal course; the breach of custom\n Is breach of all.\"--_Cymbeline._\n\nTravellers cannot be always on the alert, any more than other men. Their\nhours of weariness and of capricious idleness come, as at home; and\nthere is no security against their occurring at inconvenient\ntimes,--just when some characteristic spectacle is to be witnessed, or\nsome long-desired information is in waiting. By a little forethought,\nthe observer may guard against some of the effects of seizures of\napathy. If he would rather sleep in the carriage than get out to see a\nwaterfall, he can only feel ashamed, and rouse himself to do his duty:\nbut, by precaution, he may guard himself from passing by some things\nless beautiful than waterfalls, and to have seen which is less necessary\nto his reputation as a traveller; but which yet he will be more sorry\neventually to have lost.\n\nTo keep himself up to his business, and stimulate his flagging\nattention, he should provide himself, before setting out, with a set of\nqueries, so prepared as to include every great class of facts connected\nwith the condition of a people, and so divided and arranged as that he\ncan turn to the right set at the fitting moment.--These queries are not\ndesigned to be thrust into the hand of any one who may have information\nto give. They should not even be allowed to catch his eye. The traveller\nwho has the air of taking notes in the midst of conversation, is in\ndanger of bringing away information imperfect as far as it goes, and\nmuch restricted in quantity in comparison with what it would be if he\nallowed it to be forgotten that he was a foreigner seeking information.\nIf he permits the conversation to flow on naturally, without checking it\nby the production of the pencil and tablets, he will, even if his memory\nbe not of the best, have more to set down at night than if he noted on\nthe spot, as evidence, what a companion might be saying to him. But a\nglance in the morning at his list of queries may suggest inquiries which\nhe might not otherwise remember to make; and they will help him\nafterwards to arrange the knowledge he has gained. He can be constantly\nadding to them as he goes along, and as new subjects arise, till he is\nin possession of a catechism on the facts which indicate morals and\nmanners; which must prevent his researches being so capricious, and his\ninformation so vague as his moods and his idleness would otherwise\noccasionally make them.\n\nThe character of these queries must, of course, depend much on where the\ntraveller means to go. A set which would suit one nation would not\ncompletely apply to any other. The observer will do wisely to employ\nhis utmost skill in framing them. His cares will be better bestowed on\nthis than even on his travelling appointments, important as these are to\nhis comfort. When he has done his best in the preparation of his lists,\nhe must still keep on the watch to enlarge them, as occasion arises.\n\nSome travellers unite in one the functions of the query list and the\njournal: having the diary headed and arranged for the reception of\nclassified information. But this seems to be debasing the function of a\njournal, whose object ought to be to reflect the mind of a traveller,\nand give back to him hereafter the image of what he thought and felt day\nby day. This is its primary function;--a most useful one, as every\ntraveller knows who has kept one during a year's wandering in a foreign\ncountry. On his return, he laughs at the crudity of the information, and\nthe childishness of the impressions, set down in the opening pages; and\ntraces, with as much wonder as interest, the gradual expansion of his\nknowledge, education of his perceptions, and maturing of his judgments\nas to what is before him, as week succeeds to week, and each month\nmellows the experience of the last.\n\nThe subordinate purpose of the journal is to record facts; and the way\nin which this is done ought not to depend on the stationer's rule, but\non the nature of the traveller's mind. No man can write down daily all\nthat he learns in a day's travel. It ought to be a matter of serious\nconsideration with him what he will insert, and what trust to his\nmemory. The simplest method seems to be to set down what is most likely\nto be let slip, and to trust to the memory what the affections and\ntastes of the traveller will not allow him to forget. One who especially\nenjoys intimate domestic intercourse will write, not fireside\nconversations, but the opinions of statesmen, and the doctrine of\nparties on great social questions. One whose tastes are religious will\nnote less on the subject of public worship and private religious\ndiscourse, than dates, numbers, and facts on subjects of subordinate\ninterest. All should record anecdotes and sayings which illustrate\ncharacter. These are disjointed, and will escape almost any memory, if\nnot secured in writing. Those who do not draw should also note scenery.\nA very few descriptive touches will bring back a landscape, with all its\nhuman interest, after a lapse of years: while perhaps there is no memory\nin the world which will present unaided the distinctive character of a\nsuccession of scenes. The returned traveller is ashamed to see the\nextent of his record of his personal feelings. His changes of mood, his\nsufferings from heat or cold, from hunger or weariness, are the most\ninteresting things to him at the moment; and down they go, in the place\nof things much better worth recording, and he pays the penalty in many a\nblush hereafter. His best method will be to record as little as possible\nabout himself; and, of other things, most of what he is pretty sure to\nforget, and least of what he can hardly help remembering.\n\nGenerally speaking, he will find it desirable to defer the work of\ngeneralization till he gets home. In the earlier stages of his journey,\nat least, he will restrict his pen to the record of facts and\nimpressions; or, if his mind should have an unconquerable theorizing\ntendency, he will be so far cautious as to put down his inferences\nconjecturally. It is easy to do this; and it may make an eternal\ndifference to the observer's love of truth, and attainment of it,\nwhether he preserves his philosophic thoughts in the form of dogmas or\nof queries.\n\nThough it is commonly spoken of as a settled thing that the journal\nshould be written at night, there are many who do not agree to this.\nThere are some whose memory fails when the body is tired, and who find\nthemselves clear-headed about many things in the morning which were but\nimperfectly remembered before they had the refreshment of sleep. The\nearly morning is probably the best time for the greater number; but it\nis a safe general rule that the journal should be written in the\ninterval when the task is pleasantest. Whether the regularity be\npleasant or not, (and to the most conscientious travellers it is the\nmost agreeable,) the entries ought to be made daily, if possible. The\nloss incurred by delay is manifest to any one who has tried. The\nshortest entries are always those which have been deferred. The delay of\na single day is found to reduce the matter unaccountably. In the midst\nof his weariness and unwillingness to take out his pen, the traveller\nmay comfort himself by remembering that he will reap the reward of\ndiligence in satisfaction when he gets home. He may assure himself that\nno lines that he can write can ever be more valuable than those in which\nhe hives his treasures of travel. If he turns away from the task, he\nwill have uneasy feelings connected with his journey as often as he\nlooks back upon it;--feelings of remorse for his idleness, and of regret\nfor irretrievable loss. If, on the other hand, he perseveres in the\ndaily duty, he will go forward each morning with a disburthened mind,\nand will find, in future years, that he loves the very blots and\nweather-stains on the pages which are so many remembrancers of his\nsatisfactory labours and profitable pleasures.\n\nBesides the journal, the traveller should have a note-book,--always at\nhand,--not to be pulled out before people's eyes, for the entry of facts\nrelated, but to be used for securing the transient appearances which,\nthough revealing so much to an observing mind, cannot be recalled with\nentire precision. In all the countries of the world, groups by the\nwayside are the most eloquent of pictures. The traveller who lets\nhimself be whirled past them, unobservant or unrecording, loses more\nthan any devices of inquiry at his inn can repair. If he can sketch, he\nshould rarely allow a characteristic group of persons, or nook of\nscenery, to escape his pencil. If he cannot use the pencil, a few\nwritten words will do. Two lines may preserve for him an exemplification\nwhich may be of great future value.--The farmers' wives of New England,\ntalking over the snake-fence at sunset, are in themselves an\nillustration of many things: so is the stern Indian in his\nblanket-cloak, standing on a mound on the prairie; so is the chamois\nhunter on his pinnacle, and the pedestrian student in the valleys of the\nHartz, and the pine-cutters on the steeps of Norway, and the travelling\nmerchant on the dyke in Holland, and the vine-dressers in Alsace, and\nthe beggars in the streets of Spanish cities, and all the children of\nall countries at their play. The traveller does not dream of passing\nunnoticed the cross in the wilderness, beneath which some brother\npilgrim lies murdered; or the group of brigands seen in the shadow of\nthe wood; or a company of Sisters of Charity, going forth to their deeds\nof mercy; or a pair of inquisitors, busy on the errands of the Holy\nOffice; or anything else which strongly appeals to his imagination or\nhis personal feelings. These pictures, thus engraved in his memory, he\nmay safely leave to be entered in his journal, night or morning: but\ngroups and scenes which ought to be quite as interesting, because they\nreveal the thoughts and ways of men, (the more familiarly the more\nfaithfully,) should be as earnestly observed; and, to give them a chance\nof equal preservation, they should be noted on the instant. If a\nforeigner opens his eyes after a nap in travelling an Irish road, would\nit not be wise to note at once what he sees that he could not see\nelsewhere? He perceives that the green lanes which branch off from the\nroad are more crowded with foliage, and less definite in their windings,\nthan any other green lanes he has seen near high roads. The road itself\nis _sui generis_, with its border of rank grass, with tufts of\nstraggling briers, and its rough stone walls, fringed with weeds, and\ngay with wild flowers. A beggarly wretch is astride on the top, singing\nthe Doxology to the tune of Paudeen O'Rafferty, and keeping time with\nhis heels: and, some way off, an old man crouches in the grass, playing\ncards,--the right hand against the left,--reviling the winner, and\ntenderly consoling the loser. Presently the stranger passes a roofless\nhut, where he sees, either a party of boys and girls throwing turf for a\nhandful of meal, or a beggar-woman and her children resting in the shade\nof the walls to eat their cold potatoes. Such scenes could be beheld\nnowhere but in Ireland: but there is no country in the world where\ngroups and pictures as characteristic do not present themselves to the\nobserving eye, and in such quick succession that they are liable to be\nconfused and lost, if not secured at the moment by brief touches of\npencil or pen. The note-book should be the repository of such.\n\nMechanical methods are nothing but in proportion to the power which uses\nthem; as the intellectual accomplishments of the traveller avail him\nlittle, and may even bring him back less wise than he went out,--a\nwanderer from truth, as well as from home,--unless he sees by a light\nfrom his heart shining through the eyes of his mind. He may see, and\nhear, and record, and infer, and conclude for ever; and he will still\nnot understand if his heart be idle,--if he have not sympathy. Sympathy\nby itself may do much: with fit intellectual and mechanical aids, it\ncannot but make the traveller a wise man. His journey may be but for a\nbrief year, or even month; but if, by his own sympathy, he grasps and\nbrings home to himself the life of a fresh portion of his race, he gains\na wisdom for which he will be the better for ever.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[A] Penny Magazine, vol. ii. p. 309.\n\n[B] Volney's Survey of the Revolutions of Empires, pp. 25, 26.\n\n[C] Mme.
