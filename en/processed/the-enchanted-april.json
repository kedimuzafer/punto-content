Small mediaeval\r\n    Italian Castle on the shores of the Mediterranean to be Let\r\n    Furnished for the month of April. Necessary servants remain. Z,\r\n    Box 1000, _The Times_.\r\n\r\nThat was its conception; yet, as in the case of many another, the\r\nconceiver was unaware of it at the moment.\r\n\r\nSo entirely unaware was Mrs. Wilkins that her April for that year had\r\nthen and there been settled for her that she dropped the newspaper with\r\na gesture that was both irritated and resigned, and went over to the\r\nwindow and stared drearily out at the dripping street.\r\n\r\nNot for her were mediaeval castles, even those that are specially\r\ndescribed as small. Not for her the shores in April of the\r\nMediterranean, and the wistaria and sunshine. Such delights were only\r\nfor the rich. Yet the advertisement had been addressed to persons who\r\nappreciate these things, so that it had been, anyhow, addressed too\r\nto her, for she certainly appreciated them; more than anybody knew;\r\nmore than she had ever told. But she was poor. In the whole world she\r\npossessed of her very own only ninety pounds, saved from year to year,\r\nput by carefully pound by pound, out of her dress allowance. She had\r\nscraped this sum together at the suggestion of her husband as a shield\r\nand refuge against a rainy day. Her dress allowance, given her by her\r\nfather, was £100 a year, so that Mrs. Wilkins’s clothes were what\r\nher husband, urging her to save, called modest and becoming, and her\r\nacquaintance to each other, when they spoke of her at all, which was\r\nseldom for she was very negligible, called a perfect sight.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins, a solicitor, encouraged thrift, except that branch of it\r\nwhich got into his food. He did not call that thrift, he called it bad\r\nhousekeeping. But for the thrift which, like moth, penetrated into Mrs.\r\nWilkins’s clothes and spoilt them, he had much praise. “You never\r\nknow,” he said, “when there will be a rainy day, and you may be very\r\nglad to find you have a nest-egg. Indeed we both may.”\r\n\r\nLooking out of the club window into Shaftesbury Avenue—hers was an\r\neconomical club, but convenient for Hampstead, where she lived, and for\r\nShoolbred’s, where she shopped—Mrs. Wilkins, having stood there some\r\ntime very drearily, her mind’s eye on the Mediterranean in April, and\r\nthe wistaria, and the enviable opportunities of the rich, while her\r\nbodily eye watched the really extremely horrible sooty rain falling\r\nsteadily on the hurrying umbrellas and splashing omnibuses, suddenly\r\nwondered whether perhaps this was not the rainy day Mellersh—Mellersh\r\nwas Mr. Wilkins—had so often encouraged her to prepare for, and whether\r\nto get out of such a climate and into the small mediaeval castle wasn’t\r\nperhaps what Providence had all along intended her to do with her\r\nsavings. Part of her savings, of course; perhaps quite a small part.\r\nThe castle, being mediaeval, might also be dilapidated, and\r\ndilapidations were surely cheap. She wouldn’t in the least mind a few\r\nof them, because you didn’t pay for dilapidations which were already\r\nthere; on the contrary—by reducing the price you had to pay they really\r\npaid you. But what nonsense to think of it . . .\r\n\r\nShe turned away from the window with the same gesture of mingled\r\nirritation and resignation with which she had laid down _The Times_,\r\nand crossed the room towards the door with the intention of getting her\r\nmackintosh and umbrella and fighting her way into one of the\r\novercrowded omnibuses and going to Shoolbred’s on her way home and\r\nbuying some soles for Mellersh’s dinner—Mellersh was difficult with\r\nfish and liked only soles, except salmon—when she beheld Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, a woman she knew by sight as also living in Hampstead and\r\nbelonging to the club, sitting at the table in the middle of the room\r\non which the newspapers and magazines were kept, absorbed, in her turn,\r\nin the first page of _The Times_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins had never yet spoken to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who belonged to\r\none of the various church sets, and who analysed, classified, divided\r\nand registered the poor; whereas she and Mellersh, when they did go\r\nout, went to the parties of impressionist painters, of whom in\r\nHampstead there were many. Mellersh had a sister who had married one of\r\nthem and lived up on the Heath, and because of this alliance Mrs.\r\nWilkins was drawn into a circle which was highly unnatural to her, and\r\nshe had learned to dread pictures. She had to say things about them,\r\nand she didn’t know what to say. She used to murmur, “Marvellous,” and\r\nfeel that it was not enough. But nobody minded. Nobody listened. Nobody\r\ntook any notice of Mrs. Wilkins. She was the kind of person who is not\r\nnoticed at parties. Her clothes, infested by thrift, made her\r\npractically invisible; her face was non-arresting; her conversation was\r\nreluctant; she was shy. And if one’s clothes and face and conversation\r\nare all negligible, thought Mrs. Wilkins, who recognised her\r\ndisabilities, what, at parties, is there left of one?\r\n\r\nAlso she was always with Wilkins, that clean-shaven, fine-looking man,\r\nwho gave a party, merely by coming to it, a great air. Wilkins was\r\nvery respectable. He was known to be highly thought of by his senior\r\npartners. His sister’s circle admired him. He pronounced adequately\r\nintelligent judgments on art and artists. He was pithy; he was prudent;\r\nhe never said a word too much, nor, on the other hand, did he ever\r\nsay a word too little. He produced the impression of keeping copies\r\nof everything he said; and he was so obviously reliable that it often\r\nhappened that people who met him at these parties became discontented\r\nwith their own solicitors, and after a period of restlessness\r\nextricated themselves and went to Wilkins.\r\n\r\nNaturally Mrs. Wilkins was blotted out. “She,” said his sister, with\r\nsomething herself of the judicial, the digested, and the final in her\r\nmanner, “should stay at home.” But Wilkins could not leave his wife at\r\nhome. He was a family solicitor, and all such have wives and show them.\r\nWith his in the week he went to parties, and with his on Sundays he\r\nwent to church. Being still fairly young—he was thirty-nine—and\r\nambitious of old ladies, of whom he had not yet acquired in his\r\npractice a sufficient number, he could not afford to miss church, and\r\nit was there that Mrs. Wilkins became familiar, though never through\r\nwords, with Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nShe saw her marshalling the children of the poor into pews. She would\r\ncome in at the head of the procession from the Sunday School exactly\r\nfive minutes before the choir, and get her boys and girls neatly fitted\r\ninto their allotted seats, and down on their little knees in their\r\npreliminary prayer, and up again on their feet just as, to the swelling\r\norgan, the vestry door opened, and the choir and clergy, big with the\r\nlitanies and commandments they were presently to roll out, emerged. She\r\nhad a sad face, yet she was evidently efficient. The combination used\r\nto make Mrs. Wilkins wonder, for she had been told by Mellersh, on days\r\nwhen she had only been able to get plaice, that if one were efficient\r\none wouldn’t be depressed, and that if one does one’s job well one\r\nbecomes automatically bright and brisk.\r\n\r\nAbout Mrs. Arbuthnot there was nothing bright and brisk, though much in\r\nher way with the Sunday School children that was automatic; but when\r\nMrs. Wilkins, turning from the window, caught sight of her in the club\r\nshe was not being automatic at all, but was looking fixedly at one\r\nportion of the first page of _The Times_, holding the paper quite\r\nstill, her eyes not moving. She was just staring; and her face, as\r\nusual, was the face of a patient and disappointed Madonna.\r\n\r\nObeying an impulse she wondered at even while obeying it, Mrs. Wilkins,\r\nthe shy and the reluctant, instead of proceeding as she had intended to\r\nthe cloakroom and from thence to Schoolbred’s in search of Mellersh’s\r\nfish, stopped at the table and sat down exactly opposite Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, to whom she had never yet spoken in her life.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those long, narrow refectory tables, so that they were\r\nquite close to each other.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot, however, did not look up. She continued to gaze, with\r\neyes that seemed to be dreaming, at one spot only of The Times.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins watched her a minute, trying to screw up courage to speak\r\nto her. She wanted to ask her if she had seen the advertisement. She\r\ndid not know why she wanted to ask her this, but she wanted to. How\r\nstupid not to be able to speak to her. She looked so kind. She looked\r\nso unhappy. Why couldn’t two unhappy people refresh each other on their\r\nway through this dusty business of life by a little talk—real, natural\r\ntalk, about what they felt, what they would have liked, what they still\r\ntried to hope? And she could not help thinking that Mrs. Arbuthnot,\r\ntoo, was reading that very same advertisement. Her eyes were on the\r\nvery part of the paper. Was she, too, picturing what it would be\r\nlike—the colour, the fragrance, the light, the soft lapping of the sea\r\namong little hot rocks? Colour, fragrance, light, sea; instead of\r\nShaftesbury Avenue, and the wet omnibuses, and the fish department at\r\nShoolbred’s, and the Tube to Hampstead, and dinner, and to-morrow the\r\nsame and the day after the same and always the same . . .\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mrs. Wilkins found herself leaning across the table. “Are you\r\nreading about the mediaeval castle and the wistaria?” she heard herself\r\nasking.\r\n\r\nNaturally Mrs. Arbuthnot was surprised; but she was not half so much\r\nsurprised as Mrs. Wilkins was at herself for asking.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot had not yet to her knowledge set eyes on the shabby,\r\nlank, loosely-put-together figure sitting opposite her, with its small\r\nfreckled face and big grey eyes almost disappearing under a\r\nsmashed-down wet-weather hat, and she gazed at her a moment without\r\nanswering. She _was_ reading about the mediaeval castle and the\r\nwistaria, or rather had read about it ten minutes before, and since\r\nthen had been lost in dreams—of light, of colour, of fragrance, of the\r\nsoft lapping of the sea among little hot rocks . . .\r\n\r\n“Why do you ask me that?” she said in her grave voice, for her training\r\nof and by the poor had made her grave and patient.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins flushed and looked excessively shy and frightened. “Oh,\r\nonly because I saw it too, and I thought perhaps—I thought somehow—”\r\nshe stammered.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mrs. Arbuthnot, her mind being used to getting people into\r\nlists and divisions, from habit considered, as she gazed thoughtfully\r\nat Mrs. Wilkins, under what heading, supposing she had to classify her,\r\nshe could most properly be put.\r\n\r\n“And I know you by sight,” went on Mrs. Wilkins, who, like all the shy,\r\nonce she was started plunged on, frightening herself to more and more\r\nspeech by the sheer sound of what she had said last in her ears. “Every\r\nSunday—I see you every Sunday in church—”\r\n\r\n“In church?” echoed Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“And this seems such a wonderful thing—this advertisement about the\r\nwistaria—and—”\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins, who must have been at least thirty, broke off and\r\nwriggled in her chair with the movement of an awkward and embarrassed\r\nschoolgirl.\r\n\r\n“It seems _so_ wonderful,” she went on in a kind of burst, “and—it is\r\nsuch a miserable day . . .”\r\n\r\nAnd then she sat looking at Mrs. Arbuthnot with the eyes of an\r\nimprisoned dog.\r\n\r\n“This poor thing,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose life was spent in\r\nhelping and alleviating, “needs advice.”\r\n\r\nShe accordingly prepared herself patiently to give it.\r\n\r\n“If you see me in church,” she said, kindly and attentively, “I suppose\r\nyou live in Hampstead too?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” said Mrs. Wilkins. And she repeated, her head on its long\r\nthin neck drooping a little as if the recollection of Hampstead bowed\r\nher, “Oh yes.”\r\n\r\n“Where?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, who, when advice was needed, naturally\r\nfirst proceeded to collect the facts.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Wilkins, laying her hand softly and caressingly on the part\r\nof _The Times_ where the advertisement was, as though the mere printed\r\nwords of it were precious, only said, “Perhaps that’s why _this_ seems\r\nso wonderful.”\r\n\r\n“No—I think _that’s_ wonderful anyhow,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, forgetting\r\nfacts and faintly sighing.\r\n\r\n“Then you _were_ reading it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, her eyes going dreamy again.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t it be wonderful?” murmured Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Wonderful,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. Her face, which had lit up, faded\r\ninto patience again. “Very wonderful,” she said. “But it’s no use\r\nwasting one’s time thinking of such things.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but it _is_,” was Mrs. Wilkins’s quick, surprising reply;\r\nsurprising because it was so much unlike the rest of her—the\r\ncharacterless coat and skirt, the crumpled hat, the undecided wisp of\r\nhair straggling out. “And just the considering of them is worth while\r\nin itself—such a change from Hampstead—and sometimes I believe—I really\r\ndo believe—if one considers hard enough one gets things.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot observed her patiently. In what category would she,\r\nsupposing she had to, put her?\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” she said, leaning forward a little, “you will tell me your\r\nname. If we are to be friends”—she smiled her grave smile—“as I hope we\r\nare, we had better begin at the beginning.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes—how kind of you. I’m Mrs. Wilkins,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “I don’t\r\nexpect,” she added, flushing, as Mrs. Arbuthnot said nothing, “that it\r\nconveys anything to you. Sometimes it—it doesn’t seem to convey\r\nanything to me either. But”—she looked round with a movement of seeking\r\nhelp—“I _am_ Mrs. Wilkins.”\r\n\r\nShe did not like her name. It was a mean, small name, with a kind of\r\nfacetious twist, she thought, about its end like the upward curve of a\r\npugdog’s tail. There it was, however. There was no doing anything with\r\nit. Wilkins she was and Wilkins she would remain; and though her\r\nhusband encouraged her to give it on all occasions as Mrs.\r\nMellersh-Wilkins she only did that when he was within earshot, for she\r\nthought Mellersh made Wilkins worse, emphasising it in the way\r\nChatsworth on the gate-posts of a villa emphasises the villa.\r\n\r\nWhen first he suggested she should add Mellersh she had objected for\r\nthe above reason, and after a pause—Mellersh was much too prudent to\r\nspeak except after a pause, during which presumably he was taking a\r\ncareful mental copy of his coming observation—he said, much displeased,\r\n“But I am not a villa,” and looked at her as he looks who hopes, for\r\nperhaps the hundredth time, that he may not have married a fool.\r\n\r\nOf course he was not a villa, Mrs. Wilkins assured him; she had never\r\nsupposed he was; she had not dreamed of meaning . . . she was only just\r\nthinking . . .\r\n\r\nThe more she explained the more earnest became Mellersh’s hope,\r\nfamiliar to him by this time, for he had then been a husband for two\r\nyears, that he might not by any chance have married a fool; and they\r\nhad a prolonged quarrel, if that can be called a quarrel which is\r\nconducted with dignified silence on one side and earnest apology on the\r\nother, as to whether or no Mrs. Wilkins had intended to suggest that\r\nMr. Wilkins was a villa.\r\n\r\n“I believe,” she had thought when it was at last over—it took a long\r\nwhile—“that _anybody_ would quarrel about _anything_ when they’ve not\r\nleft off being together for a single day for two whole years. What we\r\nboth need is a holiday.”\r\n\r\n“My husband,” went on Mrs. Wilkins to Mrs. Arbuthnot, trying to throw\r\nsome light on herself, “is a solicitor. He—” She cast about for\r\nsomething she could say elucidatory of Mellersh, and found: “He’s very\r\nhandsome.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot kindly, “that must be a great pleasure to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, a little taken aback, for constant\r\nintercourse with the poor had accustomed her to have her pronouncements\r\naccepted without question, “because beauty—handsomeness—is a gift like\r\nany other, and if it is properly used—”\r\n\r\nShe trailed off into silence. Mrs. Wilkins’s great grey eyes were fixed\r\non her, and it seemed suddenly to Mrs. Arbuthnot that perhaps she was\r\nbecoming crystallised into a habit of exposition, and of exposition\r\nafter the manner of nursemaids, through having an audience that\r\ncouldn’t but agree, that would be afraid, if it wished, to interrupt,\r\nthat didn’t know, that was, in fact, at her mercy.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Wilkins was not listening; for just then, absurd as it seemed,\r\na picture had flashed across her brain, and there were two figures in\r\nit sitting together under a great trailing wistaria that stretched\r\nacross the branches of a tree she didn’t know, and it was herself and\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot—she saw them—she saw them. And behind them, bright in\r\nsunshine, were old grey walls—the mediaeval castle—she saw it—they\r\nwere there . . .\r\n\r\nShe therefore stared at Mrs. Arbuthnot and did not hear a word she\r\nsaid. And Mrs. Arbuthnot stared too at Mrs. Wilkins, arrested by the\r\nexpression on her face, which was swept by the excitement of what she\r\nsaw, and was as luminous and tremulous under it as water in sunlight\r\nwhen it is ruffled by a gust of wind. At this moment, if she had been\r\nat a party, Mrs. Wilkins would have been looked at with interest.\r\n\r\nThey stared at each other; Mrs. Arbuthnot surprised, inquiringly, Mrs.\r\nWilkins with the eyes of some one who has had a revelation. Of course.\r\nThat was how it could be done. She herself, she by herself, couldn’t\r\nafford it, and wouldn’t be able, even if she could afford it, to go\r\nthere all alone; but she and Mrs. Arbuthnot together . . .\r\n\r\nShe leaned across the table. “Why don’t we try and get it?” she\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot became even more wide-eyed. “Get it?” she repeated.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Wilkins, still as though she were afraid of being\r\noverheard. “Not just sit here and say How wonderful, and then go home\r\nto Hampstead without having put out a finger—go home just as usual and\r\nsee about the dinner and the fish just as we’ve been doing for years\r\nand years and will go on doing for years and years. In fact,” said Mrs.\r\nWilkins, flushing to the roots of her hair, for the sound of what she\r\nwas saying, of what was coming pouring out, frightened her, and yet she\r\ncouldn’t stop, “I see no end to it. There is no end to it. So that\r\nthere ought to be a break, there ought to be intervals—in everybody’s\r\ninterests. Why, it would really be being unselfish to go away and be\r\nhappy for a little, because we would come back so much nicer. You see,\r\nafter a bit everybody needs a holiday.”\r\n\r\n“But—how do you mean, get it?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“Take it,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Take it?”\r\n\r\n“Rent it. Hire it. Have it.”\r\n\r\n“But—do you mean you and I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Between us. Share. Then it would only cost half, and you look\r\nso—you look exactly as if you wanted it just as much as I do—as if you\r\nought to have a rest—have something happy happen to you.”\r\n\r\n“Why, but we don’t know each other.”\r\n\r\n“But just think how well we would if we went away together for a month!\r\nAnd I’ve saved for a rainy day, and I expect so have you, and this _is_\r\nthe rainy day—look at it—”\r\n\r\n“She is unbalanced,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot; yet she felt strangely\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\n“Think of getting away for a whole month—from everything—to heaven—”\r\n\r\n“She shouldn’t say things like that,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot. “The\r\nvicar—” Yet she felt strangely stirred. It would indeed be wonderful to\r\nhave a rest, a cessation.\r\n\r\nHabit, however, steadied her again; and years of intercourse with the\r\npoor made her say, with the slight though sympathetic superiority of\r\nthe explainer, “But then, you see, heaven isn’t somewhere else. It is\r\nhere and now. We are told so.”\r\n\r\nShe became very earnest, just as she did when trying patiently to help\r\nand enlighten the poor. “Heaven is within us,” she said in her gentle\r\nlow voice. “We are told that on the very highest authority. And you\r\nknow the lines about the kindred points, don’t you—”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I know _them_,” interrupted Mrs. Wilkins impatiently.\r\n\r\n“The kindred points of heaven and home,” continued Mrs. Arbuthnot, who\r\nwas used to finishing her sentences. “Heaven is in our home.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t,” said Mrs. Wilkins, again surprisingly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot was taken aback. Then she said gently, “Oh, but it is.\r\nIt is there if we choose, if we make it.”\r\n\r\n“I do choose, and I do make it, and it isn’t,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Arbuthnot was silent, for she too sometimes had doubts about\r\nhomes. She sat and looked uneasily at Mrs. Wilkins, feeling more and\r\nmore the urgent need to getting her classified. If she could only\r\nclassify Mrs. Wilkins, get her safely under her proper heading, she\r\nfelt that she herself would regain her balance, which did seem very\r\nstrangely to be slipping all to one side. For neither had she had a\r\nholiday for years, and the advertisement when she saw it had set her\r\ndreaming, and Mrs. Wilkins’s excitement about it was infectious, and\r\nshe had the sensation, as she listened to her impetuous, odd talk and\r\nwatched her lit-up face, that she was being stirred out of sleep.\r\n\r\nClearly Mrs. Wilkins was unbalanced, but Mrs. Arbuthnot had met the\r\nunbalanced before—indeed she was always meeting them—and they had no\r\neffect on her own stability at all; whereas this one was making her\r\nfeel quite wobbly, quite as though to be off and away, away from her\r\ncompass points of God, Husband, Home and Duty—she didn’t feel as if\r\nMrs. Wilkins intended Mr. Wilkins to come too—and just for once be\r\nhappy, would be both good and desirable. Which of course it wasn’t;\r\nwhich certainly of course it wasn’t. She, also, had a nest-egg,\r\ninvested gradually in the Post Office Savings Bank, but to suppose that\r\nshe would ever forget her duty to the extent of drawing it out and\r\nspending it on herself was surely absurd. Surely she couldn’t, she\r\nwouldn’t ever do such a thing? Surely she wouldn’t, she couldn’t ever\r\nforget her poor, forget misery and sickness as completely as that? No\r\ndoubt a trip to Italy would be extraordinarily delightful, but there\r\nwere many delightful things one would like to do, and what was strength\r\ngiven to one for except to help one not to do them?\r\n\r\nSteadfast as the points of the compass to Mrs. Arbuthnot were the great\r\nfour facts of life: God, Husband, Home, Duty. She had gone to sleep on\r\nthese facts years ago, after a period of much misery, her head resting\r\non them as on a pillow; and she had a great dread of being awakened out\r\nof so simple and untroublesome a condition. Therefore it was that she\r\nsearched with earnestness for a heading under which to put Mrs.\r\nWilkins, and in this way illumine and steady her own mind; and sitting\r\nthere looking at her uneasily after her last remark, and feeling\r\nherself becoming more and more unbalanced and infected, she decided\r\n_pro tem_, as the vicar said at meetings, to put her under the heading\r\nNerves. It was just possible that she ought to go straight into the\r\ncategory Hysteria, which was often only the antechamber to Lunacy, but\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot had learned not to hurry people into their final\r\ncategories, having on more than one occasion discovered with dismay\r\nthat she had made a mistake; and how difficult it had been to get them\r\nout again, and how crushed she had been with the most terrible remorse.\r\n\r\nYes. Nerves. Probably she had no regular work for others, thought Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot; no work that would take her outside herself. Evidently she\r\nwas rudderless—blown about by gusts, by impulses. Nerves was almost\r\ncertainly her category, or would be quite soon if no one helped her.\r\nPoor little thing, thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, her own balance returning\r\nhand in hand with her compassion, and unable, because of the table,\r\nto see the length of Mrs. Wilkins’s legs. All she saw was her small,\r\neager, shy face, and her thin shoulders, and the look of childish\r\nlonging in her eyes for something that she was sure was going to make\r\nher happy. No; such things didn’t make people happy, such fleeting\r\nthings. Mrs. Arbuthnot had learned in her long life with Frederick—he\r\nwas her husband, and she had married him at twenty and was now\r\nthirty-three—where alone true joys are to be found. They are to be\r\nfound, she now knew, only in daily, in hourly, living for others;\r\nthey are to be found only—hadn’t she over and over again taken her\r\ndisappointments and discouragements there, and come away comforted?—at\r\nthe feet of God.\r\n\r\nFrederick had been the kind of husband whose wife betakes herself early\r\nto the feet of God. From him to them had been a short though painful\r\nstep. It seemed short to her in retrospect, but it had really taken the\r\nwhole of the first year of their marriage, and every inch of the way\r\nhad been a struggle, and every inch of it was stained, she felt at the\r\ntime, with her heart’s blood. All that was over now. She had long since\r\nfound peace. And Frederick, from her passionately loved bridegroom,\r\nfrom her worshipped young husband, had become second only to God on\r\nher list of duties and forbearances. There he hung, the second in\r\nimportance, a bloodless thing bled white by her prayers. For years she\r\nhad been able to be happy only by forgetting happiness. She wanted to\r\nstay like that. She wanted to shut out everything that would remind her\r\nof beautiful things, that might set her off again longing, desiring....\r\n\r\n“I’d like so much to be friends,” she said earnestly. “Won’t you come\r\nand see me, or let me come to you sometimes? Whenever you feel as if\r\nyou wanted to talk. I’ll give you my address”—she searched in her\r\nhandbag—“and then you won’t forget.” And she found a card and held it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins ignored the card.\r\n\r\n“It’s so funny,” said Mrs. Wilkins, just as if she had not heard her,\r\n“but I _see_ us both—you and me—this April in the mediaeval castle.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot relapsed into uneasiness. “Do you?” she said, making an\r\neffort to stay balanced under the visionary gaze of the shining grey\r\neyes. “Do you?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you ever see things in a kind of flash before they happen?”\r\nasked Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Never,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nShe tried to smile; she tried to smile the sympathetic yet wise\r\nand tolerant smile with which she was accustomed to listen to the\r\nnecessarily biassed and incomplete views of the poor. She didn’t\r\nsucceed. The smile trembled out.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” she said in a low voice, almost as if she were afraid the\r\nvicar and the Savings Bank were listening, “it would be most\r\nbeautiful—most beautiful—”\r\n\r\n“Even if it were wrong,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “it would only be for a\r\nmonth.”\r\n\r\n“That—” began Mrs. Arbuthnot, quite clear as to the reprehensibleness\r\nof such a point of view; but Mrs. Wilkins stopped her before she could\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\n“Anyhow,” said Mrs. Wilkins, stopping her, “I’m sure it’s wrong to go\r\non being good for too long, till one gets miserable. And I can see\r\nyou’ve been good for years and years, because you look so unhappy”—Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot opened her mouth to protest—“and I—I’ve done nothing but\r\nduties, things for other people, ever since I was a girl, and I don’t\r\nbelieve anybody loves me a bit—a bit—the b-better—and I long—oh, I\r\nlong—for something else—something else—”\r\n\r\nWas she going to cry? Mrs. Arbuthnot became acutely uncomfortable and\r\nsympathetic. She hoped she wasn’t going to cry. Not there. Not in that\r\nunfriendly room, with strangers coming and going.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Wilkins, after tugging agitatedly at a handkerchief that\r\nwouldn’t come out of her pocket, did succeed at last in merely\r\napparently blowing her nose with it, and then, blinking her eyes very\r\nquickly once or twice, looked at Mrs. Arbuthnot with a quivering air of\r\nhalf humble, half frightened apology, and smiled.\r\n\r\n“Will you believe,” she whispered, trying to steady her mouth,\r\nevidently dreadfully ashamed of herself, “that I’ve never spoken to any\r\none before in my life like this? I can’t think, I simply don’t know,\r\nwhat has come over me.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the advertisement,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, nodding gravely.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Wilkins, dabbing furtively at her eyes, “and us both\r\nbeing so—”—she blew her nose again a little—“miserable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Mrs. Arbuthnot was not miserable—how could she be, she asked\r\nherself, when God was taking care of her?—but she let that pass for the\r\nmoment unrepudiated, because of her conviction that here was another\r\nfellow-creature in urgent need of her help; and not just boots and\r\nblankets and better sanitary arrangements this time, but the more\r\ndelicate help of comprehension, of finding the exact right words.\r\n\r\nThe exact right words, she presently discovered, after trying various\r\nones about living for others, and prayer, and the peace to be found in\r\nplacing oneself unreservedly in God’s hands—to meet all these words\r\nMrs. Wilkins had other words, incoherent and yet, for the moment at\r\nleast, till one had had more time, difficult to answer—the exact right\r\nwords were a suggestion that it would do no harm to answer the\r\nadvertisement. Non-committal. Mere inquiry. And what disturbed Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot about this suggestion was that she did not make it solely to\r\ncomfort Mrs. Wilkins; she made it because of her own strange longing\r\nfor the mediaeval castle.\r\n\r\nThis was very disturbing. There she was, accustomed to direct, to lead,\r\nto advise, to support—except Frederick; she long since had learned to\r\nleave Frederick to God—being led herself, being influenced and thrown\r\noff her feet, by just an advertisement, by just an incoherent stranger.\r\nIt was indeed disturbing. She failed to understand her sudden longing\r\nfor what was, after all, self-indulgence, when for years no such desire\r\nhad entered her heart.\r\n\r\n“There’s no harm in simply _asking_,” she said in a low voice, as if\r\nthe vicar and the Savings Bank and all her waiting and dependent poor\r\nwere listening and condemning.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t as if it _committed_ us to anything,” said Mrs. Wilkins, also\r\nin a low voice, but her voice shook.\r\n\r\nThey got up simultaneously—Mrs. Arbuthnot had a sensation of surprise\r\nthat Mrs. Wilkins should be so tall—and went to a writing-table, and\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot wrote to Z, Box 1000, _The Times_, for particulars. She\r\nasked for all particulars, but the only one they really wanted was the\r\none about the rent. They both felt that it was Mrs. Arbuthnot who ought\r\nto write the letter and do the business part. Not only was she used to\r\norganising and being practical, but she also was older, and certainly\r\ncalmer; and she herself had no doubt too that she was wiser. Neither\r\nhad Mrs. Wilkins any doubt of this; the very way Mrs. Arbuthnot parted\r\nher hair suggested a great calm that could only proceed from wisdom.\r\n\r\nBut if she was wiser, older and calmer, Mrs. Arbuthnot’s new friend\r\nnevertheless seemed to her to be the one who impelled. Incoherent, she\r\nyet impelled. She appeared to have, apart from her need of help, an\r\nupsetting kind of character. She had a curious infectiousness. She led\r\none on. And the way her unsteady mind leaped at conclusions—wrong ones,\r\nof course; witness the one that she, Mrs. Arbuthnot, was miserable—the\r\nway she leaped at conclusions was disconcerting.\r\n\r\nWhatever she was, however, and whatever her unsteadiness, Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot found herself sharing her excitement and her longing; and\r\nwhen the letter had been posted in the letter-box in the hall and\r\nactually was beyond getting back again, both she and Mrs. Wilkins felt\r\nthe same sense of guilt.\r\n\r\n“It only shows,” said Mrs. Wilkins in a whisper, as they turned away\r\nfrom the letter-box, “how immaculately good we’ve been all our lives.\r\nThe very first time we do anything our husbands don’t know about we\r\nfeel guilty.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I can’t say I’ve been immaculately good,” gently protested\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot, a little uncomfortable at this fresh example of\r\nsuccessful leaping at conclusions, for she had not said a word about\r\nher feeling of guilt.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I’m sure you have—I _see_ you being good—and that’s why you’re\r\nnot happy.”\r\n\r\n“She shouldn’t say things like that,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot. “I must\r\ntry and help her not to.”\r\n\r\nAloud she said gravely, “I don’t know why you insist that I’m not\r\nhappy. When you know me better I think you’ll find that I am. And I’m\r\nsure you don’t mean really that goodness, if one could attain it, makes\r\none unhappy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “Our sort of goodness does. We have\r\nattained it, and we are unhappy. There are miserable sorts of goodness\r\nand happy sorts—the sort we’ll have at the mediaeval castle, for\r\ninstance, is the happy sort.”\r\n\r\n“That is, supposing we go there,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot restrainingly.\r\nShe felt that Mrs. Wilkins needed holding on to. “After all, we’ve only\r\nwritten just to ask. Anybody may do that. I think it quite likely we\r\nshall find the conditions impossible, and even if they were not,\r\nprobably by to-morrow we shall not want to go.”\r\n\r\n“I _see_ us there,” was Mrs. Wilkins’s answer to that.\r\n\r\nAll this was very unbalancing. Mrs. Arbuthnot, as she presently\r\nsplashed through the dripping streets on her way to a meeting she\r\nwas to speak at, was in an unusually disturbed condition of mind.\r\nShe had, she hoped, shown herself very calm to Mrs. Wilkins, very\r\npractical and sober, concealing her own excitement. But she was really\r\nextraordinarily moved, and she felt happy, and she felt guilty, and\r\nshe felt afraid, and she had all the feelings, though this she did\r\nnot know, of a woman who has come away from a secret meeting with\r\nher lover. That, indeed, was what she looked like when she arrived\r\nlate on her platform; she, the open-browed, looked almost furtive as\r\nher eyes fell on the staring wooden faces waiting to hear her try\r\nand persuade them to contribute to the alleviation of the urgent\r\nneeds of the Hampstead poor, each one convinced that they needed\r\ncontributions themselves. She looked as though she were hiding\r\nsomething discreditable but delightful. Certainly her customary clear\r\nexpression of candour was not there, and its place was taken by a\r\nkind of suppressed and frightened pleasedness, which would have led a\r\nmore worldly-minded audience to the instant conviction of recent and\r\nprobably impassioned lovemaking.\r\n\r\nBeauty, beauty, beauty . . . the words kept ringing in her ears as she\r\nstood on the platform talking of sad things to the sparsely attended\r\nmeeting. She had never been to Italy. Was that really what her nest-egg\r\nwas to be spent on after all? Though she couldn’t approve of the way\r\nMrs. Wilkins was introducing the idea of predestination into her\r\nimmediate future, just as if she had no choice, just as if to struggle,\r\nor even to reflect, were useless, it yet influenced her. Mrs. Wilkins’s\r\neyes had been the eyes of a seer. Some people were like that, Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot knew; and if Mrs. Wilkins had actually seen her at the\r\nmediaeval castle it did seem probable that struggling would be a waste\r\nof time. Still, to spend her nest-egg on self-indulgence— The origin of\r\nthis egg had been corrupt, but she had at least supposed its end was to\r\nbe creditable. Was she to deflect it from its intended destination,\r\nwhich alone had appeared to justify her keeping it, and spend it on\r\ngiving herself pleasure?\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot spoke on and on, so much practised in the kind of speech\r\nthat she could have said it all in her sleep, and at the end of the\r\nmeeting, her eyes dazzled by her secret visions, she hardly noticed\r\nthat nobody was moved in any way whatever, least of all in the way of\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\nBut the vicar noticed. The vicar was disappointed. Usually his good\r\nfriend and supporter Mrs. Arbuthnot succeeded better than this. And,\r\nwhat was even more unusual, she appeared, he observed, not even to\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n“I can’t imagine,” he said to her as they parted, speaking irritably,\r\nfor he was irritated both by the audience and by her, “what these\r\npeople are coming to. _Nothing_ seems to move them.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they need a holiday,” suggested Mrs. Arbuthnot; an\r\nunsatisfactory, a queer reply, the vicar thought.\r\n\r\n“In February?” he called after her sarcastically.\r\n\r\n“Oh no—not till April,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Very odd,” thought the vicar. “Very odd indeed.” And he went home and\r\nwas not perhaps quite christian to his wife.\r\n\r\nThat night in her prayers Mrs. Arbuthnot asked for guidance. She felt\r\nshe ought really to ask, straight out and roundly, that the mediaeval\r\ncastle should already have been taken by some one else and the whole\r\nthing thus be settled, but her courage failed her. Suppose her prayer\r\nwere to be answered? No; she couldn’t ask it; she couldn’t risk it. And\r\nafter all—she almost pointed this out to God—if she spent her present\r\nnest-egg on a holiday she could quite soon accumulate another.\r\nFrederick pressed money on her; and it would only mean, while she\r\nrolled up a second egg, that for a time her contributions to the parish\r\ncharities would be less. And then it could be the next nest-egg whose\r\noriginal corruption would be purged away by the use to which it was\r\nfinally put.\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. Arbuthnot, who had no money of her own, was obliged to live\r\non the proceeds of Frederick’s activities, and her very nest-egg was\r\nthe fruit, posthumously ripened, of ancient sin. The way Frederick made\r\nhis living was one of the standing distresses of her life. He wrote\r\nimmensely popular memoirs, regularly, every year, of the mistresses of\r\nkings. There were in history numerous kings who had had mistresses,\r\nand there were still more numerous mistresses who had had kings; so\r\nthat he had been able to publish a book of memoirs during each year of\r\nhis married life, and even so there were great further piles of these\r\nladies waiting to be dealt with. Mrs. Arbuthnot was helpless. Whether\r\nshe liked it or not, she was obliged to live on the proceeds. He gave\r\nher a dreadful sofa once, after the success of his Du Barri memoir,\r\nwith swollen cushions and soft, receptive lap, and it seemed to her\r\na miserable thing that there, in her very home, should flaunt this\r\nre-incarnation of a dead old French sinner.\r\n\r\nSimply good, convinced that morality is the basis of happiness, the\r\nfact that she and Frederick should draw their sustenance from guilt,\r\nhowever much purged by the passage of centuries, was one of the secret\r\nreasons of her sadness. The more the memoired lady had forgotten\r\nherself, the more his book about her was read and the more free-handed\r\nhe was to his wife; and all that he gave her was spent, after adding\r\nslightly to her nest-egg—for she did hope and believe that some day\r\npeople would cease to want to read of wickedness, and then Frederick\r\nwould need supporting—on helping the poor. The parish flourished\r\nbecause, to take a handful at random, of the ill-behaviour of the\r\nladies Du Barri, Montespan, Pompadour, Ninon de l’Enclos, and even of\r\nlearned Maintenon. The poor were the filter through which the money\r\nwas passed, to come out, Mrs. Arbuthnot hoped, purified. She could do\r\nno more. She had tried in days gone by to think the situation out, to\r\ndiscover the exact right course for her to take, but had found it, as\r\nshe had found Frederick, too difficult, and had left it, as she had\r\nleft Frederick, to God. Nothing of this money was spent on her house\r\nor dress; those remained, except for the great soft sofa, austere. It\r\nwas the poor who profited. Their very boots were stout with sins. But\r\nhow difficult it had been. Mrs. Arbuthnot, groping for guidance, prayed\r\nabout it to exhaustion. Ought she perhaps to refuse to touch the money,\r\nto avoid it as she would have avoided the sins which were its source?\r\nBut then what about the parish’s boots? She asked the vicar what he\r\nthought, and, through much delicate language, evasive and cautious, it\r\ndid finally appear that he was for the boots.\r\n\r\nAt least she had persuaded Frederick, when first he began his terrible\r\nsuccessful career—he only began it after their marriage; when she\r\nmarried him he had been a blameless official attached to the library of\r\nthe British Museum—to publish the memoirs under another name, so that\r\nshe was not publicly branded. Hampstead read the books with glee, and\r\nhad no idea that their writer lived in its midst. Frederick was almost\r\nunknown, even by sight, in Hampstead. He never went to any of its\r\ngatherings. Whatever it was he did in the way of recreation was done in\r\nLondon, but he never spoke of what he did or whom he saw; he might have\r\nbeen perfectly friendless for any mention he ever made of friends to\r\nhis wife. Only the vicar knew where the money for the parish came from,\r\nand he regarded it, he told Mrs. Arbuthnot, as a matter of honour not\r\nto mention it.\r\n\r\nAnd at least her little house was not haunted by the loose-lived\r\nladies, for Frederick did his work away from home. He had two rooms\r\nnear the British Museum, which was the scene of his exhumations, and\r\nthere he went every morning, and he came back long after his wife was\r\nasleep. Sometimes he did not come back at all. Sometimes she did not\r\nsee him for several days together. Then he would suddenly appear at\r\nbreakfast, having let himself in with his latchkey the night before,\r\nvery jovial and good-natured and free-handed and glad if she would\r\nallow him to give her something—a well-fed man, contented with the\r\nworld; a jolly, full-blooded, satisfied man. And she was always gentle,\r\nand anxious that his coffee should be as he liked it.\r\n\r\nHe seemed very happy. Life, she often thought, however much one\r\ntabulated was yet a mystery. There were always some people it was\r\nimpossible to place. Frederick was one of them. He didn’t seem to bear\r\nthe remotest resemblance to the original Frederick. He didn’t seem to\r\nhave the least need of any of the things he used to say were so\r\nimportant and beautiful—love, home, complete communion of thoughts,\r\ncomplete immersion in each other’s interests. After those early painful\r\nattempts to hold him up to the point from which they had hand in hand\r\nso splendidly started, attempts in which she herself had got terribly\r\nhurt and the Frederick she supposed she had married was mangled out of\r\nrecognition, she hung him up finally by her bedside as the chief\r\nsubject of her prayers, and left him, except for those, entirely to\r\nGod. She had loved Frederick too deeply to be able now to do anything\r\nbut pray for him. He had no idea that he never went out of the house\r\nwithout her blessing going with him too, hovering, like a little echo\r\nof finished love, round that once dear head. She didn’t dare think of\r\nhim as he used to be, as he had seemed to her to be in those marvellous\r\nfirst days of their love-making, of their marriage. Her child had died;\r\nshe had nothing, nobody of her own to lavish herself on. The poor\r\nbecame her children, and God the object of her love. What could be\r\nhappier than such a life, she sometimes asked herself; but her face,\r\nand particularly her eyes, continued sad.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps when we’re old . . . perhaps when we are both quite old . . .”\r\nshe would think wistfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n\r\nThe owner of the mediaeval castle was an Englishman, a Mr. Briggs, who\r\nwas in London at the moment and wrote that it had beds enough for eight\r\npeople, exclusive of servants, three sitting-rooms, battlements,\r\ndungeons, and electric light. The rent was £60 for the month, the\r\nservants’ wages were extra, and he wanted references—he wanted\r\nassurances that the second half of his rent would be paid, the first\r\nhalf being paid in advance, and he wanted assurances of respectability\r\nfrom a solicitor, or a doctor, or a clergyman. He was very polite in\r\nhis letter, explaining that his desire for references was what was\r\nusual and should be regarded as a mere formality.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins had not thought of references, and they\r\nhad not dreamed a rent could be so high. In their minds had floated\r\nsums like three guineas a week; or less, seeing that the place was\r\nsmall and old.\r\n\r\nSixty pounds for a single month.\r\n\r\nIt staggered them.\r\n\r\nBefore Mrs. Arbuthnot’s eyes rose up boots: endless vistas, all the\r\nstout boots that sixty pounds would buy; and besides the rent there\r\nwould be the servants’ wages, and the food, and the railway journeys\r\nout and home. While as for references, these did indeed seem a\r\nstumbling-block; it did seem impossible to give any without making\r\ntheir plan more public than they had intended.\r\n\r\nThey had both—even Mrs. Arbuthnot, lured for once away from perfect\r\ncandour by the realisation of the great saving of trouble and criticism\r\nan imperfect explanation would produce—they had both thought it would\r\nbe a good plan to give out, each to her own circle, their circles being\r\nluckily distinct, that each was going to stay with a friend who had a\r\nhouse in Italy. It would be true as far as it went—Mrs. Wilkins\r\nasserted that it would be quite true, but Mrs. Arbuthnot thought it\r\nwouldn’t be quite—and it was the only way, Mrs. Wilkins said, to keep\r\nMellersh even approximately quiet. To spend any of her money just on\r\nthe mere getting to Italy would cause him indignation; what he would\r\nsay if he knew she was renting part of a mediaeval castle on her own\r\naccount Mrs. Wilkins preferred not to think. It would take him days to\r\nsay it all; and this although it was her very own money, and not a\r\npenny of it had ever been his.\r\n\r\n“But I expect,” she said, “your husband is just the same. I expect all\r\nhusbands are alike in the long run.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot said nothing, because her reason for not wanting\r\nFrederick to know was the exactly opposite one—Frederick would be only\r\ntoo pleased for her to go, he would not mind it in the very least;\r\nindeed, he would hail such a manifestation of self-indulgence and\r\nworldliness with an amusement that would hurt, and urge her to have a\r\ngood time and not to hurry home with a crushing detachment. Far better,\r\nshe thought, to be missed by Mellersh than to be sped by Frederick. To\r\nbe missed, to be needed, from whatever motive, was, she thought, better\r\nthan the complete loneliness of not being missed or needed at all.\r\n\r\nShe therefore said nothing, and allowed Mrs. Wilkins to leap at her\r\nconclusions unchecked. But they did, both of them, for a whole day feel\r\nthat the only thing to be done was to renounce the mediaeval castle;\r\nand it was in arriving at this bitter decision that they really\r\nrealised how acute had been their longing for it.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose mind was trained in the finding of ways out\r\nof difficulties, found a way out of the reference difficulty; and\r\nsimultaneously Mrs. Wilkins had a vision revealing to her how to reduce\r\nthe rent.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot’s plan was simple, and completely successful. She took\r\nthe whole of the rent in person to the owner, drawing it out of her\r\nSavings Bank—again she looked furtive and apologetic, as if the clerk\r\nmust know the money was wanted for purposes of self-indulgence—and,\r\ngoing up with the six ten pound notes in her hand-bag to the address\r\nnear the Brompton Oratory where the owner lived, presented them to him,\r\nwaiving her right to pay only half. And when he saw her, and her parted\r\nhair and soft dark eyes and sober apparel, and heard her grave voice,\r\nhe told her not to bother about writing round for those references.\r\n\r\n“It’ll be all right,” he said, scribbling a receipt for the rent. “Do\r\nsit down, won’t you? Nasty day, isn’t it? You’ll find the old castle\r\nhas lots of sunshine, whatever else it hasn’t got. Husband going?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot, unused to anything but candour, looked troubled at this\r\nquestion and began to murmur inarticulately, and the owner at once\r\nconcluded that she was a widow—a war one, of course, for other widows\r\nwere old—and that he had been a fool not to guess it.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m sorry,” he said, turning red right up to his fair hair. “I\r\ndidn’t mean—h’m, h’m, h’m—”\r\n\r\nHe ran his eye over the receipt he had written. “Yes, I think that’s\r\nall right,” he said, getting up and giving it to her. “Now,” he added,\r\ntaking the six notes she held out and smiling, for Mrs. Arbuthnot was\r\nagreeable to look at, “I’m richer, and you’re happier. I’ve got money,\r\nand you’ve got San Salvatore. I wonder which is best.”\r\n\r\n“I think you know,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot with her sweet smile.\r\n\r\nHe laughed and opened the door for her. It was a pity the interview was\r\nover. He would have liked to ask her to lunch with him. She made him\r\nthink of his mother, of his nurse, of all things kind and comforting,\r\nbesides having the attraction of not being his mother or his nurse.\r\n\r\n“I hope you’ll like the old place,” he said, holding her hand a minute\r\nat the door. The very feel of her hand, even through its glove, was\r\nreassuring; it was the sort of hand, he thought, that children would\r\nlike to hold in the dark. “In April, you know, it’s simply a mass of\r\nflowers. And then there’s the sea. You must wear white. You’ll fit in\r\nvery well. There are several portraits of you there.”\r\n\r\n“Portraits?”\r\n\r\n“Madonnas, you know. There’s one on the stairs really exactly like\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot smiled and said good-bye and thanked him. Without the\r\nleast trouble and at once she had got him placed in his proper\r\ncategory: he was an artist and of an effervescent temperament.\r\n\r\nShe shook hands and left, and he wished she hadn’t. After she was gone\r\nhe supposed that he ought to have asked for those references, if only\r\nbecause she would think him so unbusiness-like not to, but he could as\r\nsoon have insisted on references from a saint in a nimbus as from that\r\ngrave, sweet lady.\r\n\r\nRose Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nHer letter, making the appointment, lay on the table.\r\n\r\nPretty name.\r\n\r\nThat difficulty, then, was overcome. But there still remained the other\r\none, the really annihilating effect of the expense on the nest-eggs,\r\nand especially on Mrs. Wilkins’s, which was in size, compared with Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot’s, as the egg of the plover to that of the duck; and this in\r\nits turn was overcome by the vision vouchsafed to Mrs. Wilkins,\r\nrevealing to her the steps to be taken for its overcoming. Having got\r\nSan Salvatore—the beautiful, the religious name, fascinated them—they\r\nin their turn would advertise in the Agony Column of _The Times_, and\r\nwould inquire after two more ladies, of similar desires to their own,\r\nto join them and share the expenses.\r\n\r\nAt once the strain of the nest-eggs would be reduced from half to a\r\nquarter. Mrs. Wilkins was prepared to fling her entire egg into the\r\nadventure, but she realised that if it were to cost even sixpence over\r\nher ninety pounds her position would be terrible. Imagine going to\r\nMellersh and saying, “I owe.” It would be awful enough if some day\r\ncircumstances forced her to say, “I have no nest-egg,” but at least she\r\nwould be supported in such a case by the knowledge that the egg had\r\nbeen her own. She therefore, though prepared to fling her last penny\r\ninto the adventure, was not prepared to fling into it a single farthing\r\nthat was not demonstrably her own; and she felt that if her share of\r\nthe rent was reduced to fifteen pounds only, she would have a safe\r\nmargin for the other expenses. Also they might economise very much on\r\nfood—gather olives off their own trees and eat them, for instance, and\r\nperhaps catch fish.\r\n\r\nOf course, as they pointed out to each other, they could reduce the\r\nrent to an almost negligible sum by increasing the number of sharers;\r\nthey could have six more ladies instead of two if they wanted to,\r\nseeing that there were eight beds. But supposing the eight beds were\r\ndistributed in couples in four rooms, it would not be altogether what\r\nthey wanted, to find themselves shut up at night with a stranger.\r\nBesides, they thought that perhaps having so many would not be quite\r\nso peaceful. After all, they were going to San Salvatore for peace and\r\nrest and joy, and six more ladies, especially if they got into one’s\r\nbedroom, might a little interfere with that.\r\nspeech first\r\nHowever, there seemed to be only two ladies in England at that moment\r\nwho had any wish to join them, for they had only two answers to their\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\n“Well, we only want two,” said Mrs. Wilkins, quickly recovering, for\r\nshe had imagined a great rush.\r\n\r\n“I think a choice would have been a good thing,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“You mean because then we needn’t have had Lady Caroline Dester.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say that,” gently protested Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“We needn’t have her,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “Just one more person would\r\nhelp us a great deal with the rent. We’re not obliged to have two.”\r\n\r\n“But why should we not have her? She seems really quite what we want.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—she does from her letter,” said Mrs. Wilkins doubtfully.\r\n\r\nShe felt she would be terribly shy of Lady Caroline. Incredible as it\r\nmay seem, seeing how they get into everything, Mrs. Wilkins had never\r\ncome across any members of the aristocracy.\r\n\r\nThey interviewed Lady Caroline, and they interviewed the other\r\napplicant, a Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\nLady Caroline came to the club in Shaftesbury Avenue, and appeared to\r\nbe wholly taken up by one great longing, a longing to get away from\r\neverybody she had ever known. When she saw the club, and Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, and Mrs. Wilkins, she was sure that here was exactly what\r\nshe wanted. She would be in Italy—a place she adored; she would not be\r\nin hotels—places she loathed; she would not be staying with\r\nfriends—persons she disliked; and she would be in the company of\r\nstrangers who would never mention a single person she knew, for the\r\nsimple reason that they had not, could not have, and would not come\r\nacross them. She asked a few questions about the fourth woman, and was\r\nsatisfied with the answers. Mrs. Fisher, of Prince of Wales Terrace. A\r\nwidow. She too would be unacquainted with any of her friends. Lady\r\nCaroline did not even know where Prince of Wales Terrace was.\r\n\r\n“It’s in London,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“Is it?” said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nIt all seemed most restful.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher was unable to come to the club because, she explained by\r\nletter, she could not walk without a stick; therefore Mrs. Arbuthnot\r\nand Mrs. Wilkins went to her.\r\n\r\n“But if she can’t come to the club how can she go to Italy?” wondered\r\nMrs. Wilkins, aloud.\r\n\r\n“We shall hear that from her own lips,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nFrom Mrs. Fisher’s lips they merely heard, in reply to delicate\r\nquestioning, that sitting in trains was not walking about; and they\r\nknew that already. Except for the stick, however, she appeared to be a\r\nmost desirable fourth—quiet, educated, elderly. She was much older than\r\nthey or Lady Caroline—Lady Caroline had informed them she was\r\ntwenty-eight—but not so old as to have ceased to be active-minded. She\r\nwas very respectable indeed, and still wore a complete suit of black\r\nthough her husband had died, she told them, eleven years before. Her\r\nhouse was full of signed photographs of illustrious Victorian dead, all\r\nof whom she said she had known when she was little. Her father had been\r\nan eminent critic, and in his house she had seen practically everybody\r\nwho was anybody in letters and art. Carlyle had scowled at her; Matthew\r\nArnold had held her on his knee; Tennyson had sonorously rallied her on\r\nthe length of her pig-tail. She animatedly showed them the photographs,\r\nhung everywhere on her walls, pointing out the signatures with her\r\nstick, and she neither gave any information about her own husband nor\r\nasked for any about the husbands of her visitors; which was the\r\ngreatest comfort. Indeed, she seemed to think that they also were\r\nwidows, for on inquiring who the fourth lady was to be, and being told\r\nit was a Lady Caroline Dester, she said, “Is she a widow too?” And on\r\ntheir explaining that she was not, because she had not yet been\r\nmarried, observed with abstracted amiability, “All in good time.”\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Fisher’s very abstractedness—and she seemed to be absorbed\r\nchiefly in the interesting people she used to know and in their\r\nmemorial photographs, and quite a good part of the interview was taken\r\nup by reminiscent anecdote of Carlyle, Meredith, Matthew Arnold,\r\nTennyson, and a host of others—her very abstractedness was a\r\nrecommendation. She only asked, she said, to be allowed to sit quiet in\r\nthe sun and remember. That was all Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins\r\nasked of their sharers. It was their idea of a perfect sharer that she\r\nshould sit quiet in the sun and remember, rousing herself on Saturday\r\nevenings sufficiently to pay her share. Mrs. Fisher was very fond, too,\r\nshe said, of flowers, and once when she was spending a week-end with\r\nher father at Box Hill—\r\n\r\n“Who lived at Box Hill?” interrupted Mrs. Wilkins, who hung on Mrs.\r\nFisher’s reminiscences, intensely excited by meeting somebody who had\r\nactually been familiar with all the really and truly and undoubtedly\r\ngreat—actually seen them, heard them talking, touched them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher looked at her over the top of her glasses in some surprise.\r\nMrs. Wilkins, in her eagerness to tear the heart out quickly of Mrs.\r\nFisher’s reminiscences, afraid that at any moment Mrs. Arbuthnot would\r\ntake her away and she wouldn’t have heard half, had already interrupted\r\nseveral times with questions which appeared ignorant to Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“Meredith of course,” said Mrs. Fisher rather shortly. “I remember a\r\nparticular week-end”—she continued. “My father often took me, but I\r\nalways remember this week-end particularly—”\r\n\r\n“Did you know Keats?” eagerly interrupted Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher, after a pause, said with sub-acid reserve that she had\r\nbeen unacquainted with both Keats and Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n“Oh of course—how ridiculous of me!” cried Mrs. Wilkins, flushing\r\nscarlet. “It’s because”—she floundered—“it’s because the immortals\r\nsomehow still seem alive, don’t they—as if they were here, going to\r\nwalk into the room in another minute—and one forgets they are dead. In\r\nfact one knows perfectly well that they’re not dead—not nearly so dead\r\nas you and I even now,” she assured Mrs. Fisher, who observed her over\r\nthe top of her glasses.\r\n\r\n“I thought I _saw_ Keats the other day,” Mrs. Wilkins incoherently\r\nproceeded, driven on by Mrs. Fisher’s look over the top of her glasses.\r\n“In Hampstead—crossing the road in front of that house—you know—the\r\nhouse where he lived—”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot said they must be going.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher did nothing to prevent them.\r\n\r\n“I _really_ thought I saw him,” protested Mrs. Wilkins, appealing for\r\nbelief first to one and then to the other while waves of colour passed\r\nover her face, and totally unable to stop because of Mrs. Fisher’s\r\nglasses and the steady eyes looking at her over their tops. “I believe\r\nI _did_ see him—he was dressed in a—”\r\n\r\nEven Mrs. Arbuthnot looked at her now, and in her gentlest voice said\r\nthey would be late for lunch.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that Mrs. Fisher asked for references. She had no\r\nwish to find herself shut up for four weeks with somebody who saw\r\nthings. It is true that there were three sitting-rooms, besides the\r\ngarden and the battlements at San Salvatore, so that there would be\r\nopportunities of withdrawal from Mrs. Wilkins; but it would be\r\ndisagreeable to Mrs. Fisher, for instance, if Mrs. Wilkins were\r\nsuddenly to assert that she saw Mr. Fisher. Mr. Fisher was dead; let\r\nhim remain so. She had no wish to be told he was walking about the\r\ngarden. The only reference she really wanted, for she was much too old\r\nand firmly seated in her place in the world for questionable associates\r\nto matter to her, was one with regard to Mrs. Wilkins’s health. Was her\r\nhealth quite normal? Was she an ordinary, everyday, sensible woman?\r\nMrs. Fisher felt that if she were given even one address she would be\r\nable to find out what she needed. So she asked for references, and her\r\nvisitors appeared to be so much taken aback—Mrs. Wilkins, indeed, was\r\ninstantly sobered—that she added, “It is usual.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins found her speech first. “But,” she said, “aren’t we the\r\nones who ought to ask for some from you?”\r\n\r\nAnd this seemed to Mrs. Arbuthnot too the right attitude. Surely it was\r\nthey who were taking Mrs. Fisher into their party, and not Mrs. Fisher\r\nwho was taking them into it?\r\n\r\nFor answer Mrs. Fisher, leaning on her stick, went to the writing-table\r\nand in a firm hand wrote down three names and offered them to Mrs.\r\nWilkins, and the names were so respectable, more, they were so\r\nmomentous, they were so nearly august, that just to read them was\r\nenough. The President of the Royal Academy, the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, and the Governor of the Bank of England—who would dare\r\ndisturb such personages in their meditations with inquiries as to\r\nwhether a female friend of theirs was all she should be?\r\n\r\n“They have known me since I was little,” said Mrs. Fisher—everybody\r\nseemed to have known Mrs. Fisher since or when she was little.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think references are nice things at all between—between\r\nordinary decent women,” burst out Mrs. Wilkins, made courageous by\r\nbeing, as she felt, at bay; for she very well knew that the only\r\nreference she could give without getting into trouble was Shoolbred,\r\nand she had little confidence in that, as it would be entirely based on\r\nMellersh’s fish. “We’re not business people. We needn’t distrust each\r\nother—”\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Arbuthnot said, with a dignity that yet was sweet, “I’m afraid\r\nreferences do bring an atmosphere into our holiday plan that isn’t\r\nquite what we want, and I don’t think we’ll take yours up or give you\r\nany ourselves. So that I suppose you won’t wish to join us.”\r\n\r\nAnd she held out her hand in good-bye.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Fisher, her gaze diverted to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who inspired\r\ntrust and liking even in Tube officials, felt that she would be idiotic\r\nto lose the opportunity of being in Italy in the particular conditions\r\noffered, and that she and this calm-browed woman between them would\r\ncertainly be able to curb the other one when she had her attacks. So\r\nshe said, taking Mrs. Arbuthnot’s offered hand, “Very well. I waive\r\nreferences.”\r\n\r\nShe waived references.\r\n\r\nThe two as they walked to the station in Kensington High Street could\r\nnot help thinking that this way of putting it was lofty. Even Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, spendthrift of excuses for lapses, thought Mrs. Fisher might\r\nhave used other words; and Mrs. Wilkins, by the time she got to the\r\nstation, and the walk and the struggle on the crowded pavement with\r\nother people’s umbrellas had warmed her blood, actually suggested\r\nwaiving Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“If there is any waiving to be done, do let us be the ones who waive,”\r\nshe said eagerly.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Arbuthnot, as usual, held on to Mrs. Wilkins; and presently,\r\nhaving cooled down in the train, Mrs. Wilkins announced that at San\r\nSalvatore Mrs. Fisher would find her level. “I see her finding her\r\nlevel there,” she said, her eyes very bright.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mrs. Arbuthnot, sitting with her quiet hands folded, turned\r\nover in her mind how best she could help Mrs. Wilkins not to see quite\r\nso much; or at least, if she must see, to see in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins, travelling\r\ntogether, should arrive at San Salvatore on the evening of March\r\n31st—the owner, who told them how to get there, appreciated their\r\ndisinclination to begin their time in it on April 1st—and Lady Caroline\r\nand Mrs. Fisher, as yet unacquainted and therefore under no obligations\r\nto bore each other on the journey, for only towards the end would they\r\nfind out by a process of sifting who they were, were to arrive on the\r\nmorning of April 2nd. In this way everything would be got nicely ready\r\nfor the two who seemed, in spite of the equality of the sharing, yet to\r\nhave something about them of guests.\r\n\r\nThere were disagreeable incidents towards the end of March, when Mrs.\r\nWilkins, her heart in her mouth and her face a mixture of guilt, terror\r\nand determination, told her husband that she had been invited to Italy,\r\nand he declined to believe it. Of course he declined to believe it.\r\nNobody had ever invited his wife to Italy before. There was no\r\nprecedent. He required proofs. The only proof was Mrs. Arbuthnot, and\r\nMrs. Wilkins had produced her; but after what entreaties, what\r\npassionate persuading! Mrs. Arbuthnot had not imagined she would have\r\nto face Mr. Wilkins and say things to him that were short of the truth,\r\nand it brought home to her what she had for some time suspected, that\r\nshe was slipping more and more away from God.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the whole of March was filled with unpleasant, anxious moments.\r\nIt was an uneasy month. Mrs. Arbuthnot’s conscience, made\r\nsuper-sensitive by years of pampering, could not reconcile what she was\r\ndoing with its own high standard of what was right. It gave her little\r\npeace. It nudged her at her prayers. It punctuated her entreaties for\r\ndivine guidance with disconcerting questions, such as, “Are you not a\r\nhypocrite? Do you really mean that? Would you not, frankly, be\r\ndisappointed if that prayer were granted?”\r\n\r\nThe prolonged wet, raw weather was on the side too of her conscience,\r\nproducing far more sickness than usual among the poor. They had\r\nbronchitis; they had fevers; there was no end to the distress. And here\r\nshe was going off, spending precious money on going off, simply and\r\nsolely to be happy. One woman. One woman being happy, and these piteous\r\nmultitudes . . .\r\n\r\nShe was unable to look the vicar in the face. He did not know, nobody\r\nknew, what she was going to do, and from the very beginning she was\r\nunable to look anybody in the face. She excused herself from making\r\nspeeches appealing for money. How could she stand up and ask people for\r\nmoney when she herself was spending so much on her own selfish\r\npleasure? Nor did it help her or quiet her that, having actually told\r\nFrederick, in her desire to make up for what she was squandering, that\r\nshe would be grateful if he would let her have some money, he instantly\r\ngave her a cheque for £100. He asked no questions. She was scarlet. He\r\nlooked at her a moment and then looked away. It was a relief to\r\nFrederick that she should take some money. She gave it all immediately\r\nto the organisation she worked with, and found herself more tangled in\r\ndoubts than ever.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins, on the contrary, had no doubts. She was quite certain\r\nthat it was a most proper thing to have a holiday, and altogether right\r\nand beautiful to spend one’s own hard-collected savings on being happy.\r\n\r\n“Think how much nicer we shall be when we come back,” she said to Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, encouraging that pale lady.\r\n\r\nNo, Mrs. Wilkins had no doubts, but she had fears; and March was for\r\nher too an anxious month, with the unconscious Mr. Wilkins coming back\r\ndaily to his dinner and eating his fish in the silence of imagined\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nAlso things happen so awkwardly. It really is astonishing, how\r\nawkwardly they happen. Mrs. Wilkins, who was very careful all this\r\nmonth to give Mellersh only the food he liked, buying it and hovering\r\nover its cooking with a zeal more than common, succeeded so well that\r\nMellersh was pleased; definitely pleased; so much pleased that he began\r\nto think that he might, after all, have married the right wife instead\r\nof, as he had frequently suspected, the wrong one. The result was that\r\non the third Sunday in the month—Mrs. Wilkins had made up her trembling\r\nmind that on the fourth Sunday, there being five in that March and\r\nit being on the fifth of them that she and Mrs. Arbuthnot were to\r\nstart, she would tell Mellersh of her invitation—on the third Sunday,\r\nthen, after a very well-cooked lunch in which the Yorkshire pudding\r\nhad melted in his mouth and the apricot tart had been so perfect that\r\nhe ate it all, Mellersh, smoking his cigar by the brightly burning\r\nfire the while hail gusts banged on the window, said: “I am thinking\r\nof taking you to Italy for Easter.” And paused for her astounded and\r\ngrateful ecstasy.\r\n\r\nNone came. The silence in the room, except for the hail hitting the\r\nwindows and the gay roar of the fire, was complete. Mrs. Wilkins could\r\nnot speak. She was dumbfounded. The next Sunday was the day she had\r\nmeant to break her news to him, and she had not yet even prepared the\r\nform of words in which she would break it.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins, who had not been abroad since before the war, and was\r\nnoticing with increasing disgust, as week followed week of wind and\r\nrain, the peculiar persistent vileness of the weather, had slowly\r\nconceived a desire to get away from England for Easter. He was doing\r\nvery well in his business. He could afford a trip. Switzerland was\r\nuseless in April. There was a familiar sound about Easter in Italy. To\r\nItaly he would go; and as it would cause comment if he did not take his\r\nwife, take her he must—besides, she would be useful; a second person\r\nwas always useful in a country whose language one did not speak for\r\nholding things, for waiting with the luggage.\r\n\r\nHe had expected an explosion of gratitude and excitement. The absence\r\nof it was incredible. She could not, he concluded, have heard. Probably\r\nshe was absorbed in some foolish day-dream. It was regrettable how\r\nchildish she remained.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head—their chairs were in front of the fire—and looked at\r\nher. She was staring straight into the fire, and it was no doubt the\r\nfire that made her face so red.\r\n\r\n“I am thinking,” he repeated, raising his clear, cultivated voice and\r\nspeaking with acerbity, for inattention at such a moment was\r\ndeplorable, “of taking you to Italy for Easter. Did you not hear me?”\r\n\r\nYes, she had heard him, and she had been wondering at the extraordinary\r\ncoincidence—really most extraordinary—she was just going to tell him\r\nhow—how she had been invited—a friend had invited her—Easter,\r\ntoo—Easter was in April, wasn’t it?—her friend had a—had a house\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn fact Mrs. Wilkins, driven by terror, guilt and surprise, had been\r\nmore incoherent if possible than usual.\r\n\r\nIt was a dreadful afternoon. Mellersh, profoundly indignant, besides\r\nhaving his intended treat coming back on him like a blessing to roost,\r\ncross-examined her with the utmost severity. He demanded that she\r\nrefuse the invitation. He demanded that, since she had so outrageously\r\naccepted it without consulting him, she should write and cancel her\r\nacceptance. Finding himself up against an unsuspected, shocking rock of\r\nobstinacy in her, he then declined to believe she had been invited to\r\nItaly at all. He declined to believe in this Mrs. Arbuthnot, of whom\r\ntill that moment he had never heard; and it was only when the gentle\r\ncreature was brought round—with such difficulty, with such a desire on\r\nher part to throw the whole thing up rather than tell Mr. Wilkins less\r\nthan the truth—and herself endorsed his wife’s statements that he was\r\nable to give them credence. He could not but believe Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\nShe produced the precise effect on him that she did on Tube officials.\r\nShe hardly needed to say anything. But that made no difference to her\r\nconscience, which knew and would not let her forget that she had given\r\nhim an incomplete impression. “Do you,” asked her conscience, “see any\r\nreal difference between an incomplete impression and a completely\r\nstated lie? God sees none.”\r\n\r\nThe remainder of March was a confused bad dream. Both Mrs. Arbuthnot\r\nand Mrs. Wilkins were shattered; try as they would not to, both felt\r\nextraordinarily guilty; and when on the morning of the 30th they did\r\nfinally get off there was no exhilaration about the departure, no\r\nholiday feeling at all.\r\n\r\n“We’ve been too good—_much_ too good,” Mrs. Wilkins kept on murmuring\r\nas they walked up and down the platform at Victoria, having arrived\r\nthere an hour before they need have, “and that’s why we feel as though\r\nwe’re doing wrong. We’re brow-beaten—we’re not any longer real human\r\nbeings. Real human beings aren’t ever as good as we’ve been. Oh”—she\r\nclenched her thin hands—“to _think_ that we ought to be so happy now,\r\nhere on the very station, actually starting, and we’re not, and it’s\r\nbeing spoilt for us just simply because we’ve spoilt _them!_ What have\r\nwe done—what have we done, I should like to know,” she inquired of Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot indignantly, “except for once want to go away by ourselves\r\nand have a little rest from _them?_”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot, patiently pacing, did not ask who she meant by _them_,\r\nbecause she knew. Mrs. Wilkins meant their husbands, persisting in her\r\nassumption that Frederick was as indignant as Mellersh over the\r\ndeparture of his wife, whereas Frederick did not even know his wife had\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot, always silent about him, had said nothing of this to\r\nMrs. Wilkins. Frederick went too deep into her heart for her to talk\r\nabout him. He was having an extra bout of work finishing another of\r\nthose dreadful books, and had been away practically continually the\r\nlast few weeks, and was away when she left. Why should she tell him\r\nbeforehand? Sure as she so miserably was that he would have no\r\nobjection to anything she did, she merely wrote him a note and put it\r\non the hall-table ready for him if and when he should come home. She\r\nsaid she was going for a month’s holiday as she needed a rest and she\r\nhad not had one for so long, and that Gladys, the efficient\r\nparlourmaid, had orders to see to his comforts. She did not say where\r\nshe was going; there was no reason why she should; he would not be\r\ninterested, he would not care.\r\n\r\nThe day was wretched, blustering and wet; the crossing was atrocious,\r\nand they were very sick. But after having been very sick, just to\r\narrive at Calais and not be sick was happiness, and it was there that\r\nthe real splendour of what they were doing first began to warm their\r\nbenumbed spirits. It got hold of Mrs. Wilkins first, and spread from\r\nher like a rose-coloured flame over her pale companion. Mellersh at\r\nCalais, where they restored themselves with soles because of Mrs.\r\nWilkins’s desire to eat a sole Mellersh wasn’t having—Mellersh at\r\nCalais had already begun to dwindle and seem less important. None of\r\nthe French porters knew him; not a single official at Calais cared a\r\nfig for Mellersh. In Paris there was no time to think of him because\r\ntheir train was late and they only just caught the Turin train at the\r\nGare de Lyons; and by the afternoon of the next day when they got into\r\nItaly, England, Frederick, Mellersh, the vicar, the poor, Hampstead,\r\nthe club, Shoolbred, everybody and everything, the whole inflamed sore\r\ndreariness, had faded to the dimness of a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was cloudy in Italy, which surprised them. They had expected\r\nbrilliant sunshine. But never mind: it was Italy, and the very clouds\r\nlooked fat. Neither of them had ever been there before. Both gazed out\r\nof the windows with rapt faces. The hours flew as long as it was\r\ndaylight, and after that there was the excitement of getting nearer,\r\ngetting quite near, getting there. At Genoa it had begun to rain—Genoa!\r\nImagine actually being at Genoa, seeing its name written up in the\r\nstation just like any other name—at Nervi it was pouring, and when at\r\nlast towards midnight, for again the train was late, they got to\r\nMezzago, the rain was coming down in what seemed solid sheets. But it\r\nwas Italy. Nothing it did could be bad. The very rain was\r\ndifferent—straight rain, falling properly on to one’s umbrella; not\r\nthat violently blowing English stuff that got in everywhere. And it did\r\nleave off; and when it did, behold the earth would be strewn with\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nMr. Briggs, San Salvatore’s owner, had said, “You get out at Mezzago,\r\nand then you drive.” But he had forgotten what he amply knew, that\r\ntrains in Italy are sometimes late, and he had imagined his tenants\r\narriving at Mezzago at eight o’clock and finding a string of flys to\r\nchoose from.\r\n\r\nThe train was four hours late, and when Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins\r\nscrambled down the ladder-like high steps of their carriage into the\r\nblack downpour, their skirts sweeping off great pools of sooty wet\r\nbecause their hands were full of suit-cases, if it had not been for the\r\nvigilance of Domenico, the gardener at San Salvatore, they would have\r\nfound nothing for them to drive in. All ordinary flys had long since\r\ngone home. Domenico, foreseeing this, had sent his aunt’s fly, driven\r\nby her son his cousin; and his aunt and her fly lived in Castagneto,\r\nthe village crouching at the feet of San Salvatore, and therefore,\r\nhowever late the train was, the fly would not dare come home without\r\ncontaining that which it had been sent to fetch.\r\n\r\nDomenico’s cousin’s name was Beppo, and he presently emerged out of the\r\ndark where Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins stood, uncertain what to do\r\nnext after the train had gone on, for they could see no porter and they\r\nthought from the feel of it that they were standing not so much on a\r\nplatform as in the middle of the permanent way.\r\n\r\nBeppo, who had been searching for them, emerged from the dark with a\r\nkind of pounce and talked Italian to them vociferously. Beppo was a\r\nmost respectable young man, but he did not look as if he were,\r\nespecially not in the dark, and he had a dripping hat slouched over one\r\neye. They did not like the way he seized their suit-cases. He could not\r\nbe, they thought, a porter. However, they presently from out of his\r\nstreaming talk discerned the words San Salvatore, and after that they\r\nkept on saying them to him, for it was the only Italian they knew, as\r\nthey hurried after him, unwilling to lose sight of their suit-cases,\r\nstumbling across rails and through puddles out to where in the road a\r\nsmall, high fly stood.\r\n\r\nIts hood was up, and its horse was in an attitude of thought. They\r\nclimbed in, and the minute they were in—Mrs. Wilkins, indeed, could\r\nhardly be called in—the horse awoke with a start from its reverie and\r\nimmediately began going home rapidly; without Beppo; without the\r\nsuit-cases.\r\n\r\nBeppo darted after him, making the night ring with his shouts, and\r\ncaught the hanging reins just in time. He explained proudly, and as it\r\nseemed to him with perfect clearness, that the horse always did that,\r\nbeing a fine animal full of corn and blood, and cared for by him,\r\nBeppo, as if he were his own son, and the ladies must not be alarmed—he\r\nhad noticed they were clutching each other; but clear, and loud, and\r\nprofuse of words though he was, they only looked at him blankly.\r\n\r\nHe went on talking, however, while he piled the suit-cases up round\r\nthem, sure that sooner or later they must understand him, especially as\r\nhe was careful to talk very loud and illustrate everything he said with\r\nthe simplest elucidatory gestures, but they both continued only to look\r\nat him. They both, he noticed sympathetically, had white faces,\r\nfatigued faces, and they both had big eyes, fatigued eyes. They were\r\nbeautiful ladies, he thought, and their eyes, looking at him over the\r\ntops of the suit-cases watching his every movement—there were no\r\ntrunks, only numbers of suit-cases—were like the eyes of the Mother of\r\nGod. The only thing the ladies said, and they repeated it at regular\r\nintervals, even after they had started, gently prodding him as he sat\r\non his box to call his attention to it, was, “San Salvatore?”\r\n\r\nAnd each time he answered vociferously, encouragingly, “_Sì, sì_—San\r\nSalvatore.”\r\n\r\n“We don’t _know_ of course if he’s taking us there,” said Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot at last in a low voice, after they had been driving as it\r\nseemed to them a long while, and had got off the paving-stones of the\r\nsleep-shrouded town and were out on a winding road with what they could\r\njust see was a low wall on their left beyond which was a great black\r\nemptiness and the sound of the sea. On their right was something close\r\nand steep and high and black—rocks, they whispered to each other; huge\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n“No—we don’t _know_,” agreed Mrs. Wilkins, a slight coldness passing\r\ndown her spine.\r\n\r\nThey felt very uncomfortable. It was so late. It was so dark. The road\r\nwas so lonely. Suppose a wheel came off. Suppose they met Fascisti, or\r\nthe opposite of Fascisti. How sorry they were now that they had not\r\nslept at Genoa and come on the next morning in daylight.\r\n\r\n“But that would have been the first of April,” said Mrs. Wilkins, in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n“It is that now,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot beneath her breath.\r\n\r\n“So it is,” murmured Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\nThey were silent.\r\n\r\nBeppo turned round on his box—a disquieting habit already noticed, for\r\nsurely his horse ought to be carefully watched—and again addressed them\r\nwith what he was convinced was lucidity—no _patois_, and the clearest\r\nexplanatory movements.\r\n\r\nHow much they wished their mothers had made them learn Italian when\r\nthey were little. If only now they could have said, “Please sit round\r\nthe right way and look after the horse.” They did not even know what\r\nhorse was in Italian. It was contemptible to be so ignorant.\r\n\r\nIn their anxiety, for the road twisted round great jutting rocks, and\r\non their left was only the low wall to keep them out of the sea should\r\nanything happen, they too began to gesticulate, waving their hands at\r\nBeppo, pointing ahead. They wanted him to turn round again and face his\r\nhorse, that was all. He thought they wanted him to drive faster; and\r\nthere followed a terrifying ten minutes during which, as he supposed,\r\nhe was gratifying them. He was proud of his horse, and it could go very\r\nfast. He rose in his seat, the whip cracked, the horse rushed forward,\r\nthe rocks leaped towards them, the little fly swayed, the suit-cases\r\nheaved, Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins clung. In this way they\r\ncontinued, swaying, heaving, clattering, clinging, till at a point near\r\nCastagneto there was a rise in the road, and on reaching the foot of\r\nthe rise the horse, who knew every inch of the way, stopped suddenly,\r\nthrowing everything in the fly into a heap, and then proceeded up at\r\nthe slowest of walks.\r\n\r\nBeppo twisted himself round to receive their admiration, laughing with\r\npride in his horse.\r\n\r\nThere was no answering laugh from the beautiful ladies. Their eyes,\r\nfixed on him, seemed bigger than ever, and their faces against the\r\nblack of the night showed milky.\r\n\r\nBut here at least, once they were up the slope, were houses. The rocks\r\nleft off, and there were houses; the low wall left off, and there were\r\nhouses; the sea shrunk away, and the sound of it ceased, and the\r\nloneliness of the road was finished. No lights anywhere, of course,\r\nnobody to see them pass; and yet Beppo, when the houses began, after\r\nlooking over his shoulder and shouting “Castagneto” at the ladies, once\r\nmore stood up and cracked his whip and once more made his horse dash\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n“We shall be there in a minute,” Mrs. Arbuthnot said to herself,\r\nholding on.\r\n\r\n“We shall soon stop now,” Mrs. Wilkins said to herself, holding on.\r\nThey said nothing aloud, because nothing would have been heard above\r\nthe whip-cracking and the wheel-clattering and the boisterous inciting\r\nnoises Beppo was making at his horse.\r\n\r\nAnxiously they strained their eyes for any sight of the beginning of\r\nSan Salvatore.\r\n\r\nThey had supposed and hoped that after a reasonable amount of village a\r\nmediaeval archway would loom upon them, and through it they would drive\r\ninto a garden and draw up at an open, welcoming door, with light\r\nstreaming from it and those servants standing in it who, according to\r\nthe advertisement, remained.\r\n\r\nInstead the fly suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\nPeering out they could see they were still in the village street, with\r\nsmall dark houses each side; and Beppo, throwing the reins over the\r\nhorse’s back as if completely confident this time that he would not go\r\nany farther, got down off his box. At the same moment, springing as it\r\nseemed out of nothing, a man and several half-grown boys appeared on\r\neach side of the fly and began dragging out the suit-cases.\r\n\r\n“No, no—San Salvatore, San Salvatore”—exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins, trying to\r\nhold on to what suit-cases she could.\r\n\r\n“_Sì, sì_—San Salvatore,” they all shouted, pulling.\r\n\r\n“This _can’t_ be San Salvatore,” said Mrs. Wilkins, turning to Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, who sat quite still watching her suit-cases being taken from\r\nher with the same patience she applied to lesser evils. She knew she\r\ncould do nothing if these men were wicked men determined to have her\r\nsuit-cases.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it can be,” she admitted, and could not refrain from a\r\nmoment’s wonder at the ways of God. Had she really been brought here,\r\nshe and poor Mrs. Wilkins, after so much trouble in arranging it, so\r\nmuch difficulty and worry, along such devious paths of prevarication\r\nand deceit, only to be—\r\n\r\nShe checked her thoughts, and gently said to Mrs. Wilkins, while the\r\nragged youths disappeared with the suit-cases into the night and the\r\nman with the lantern helped Beppo pull the rug off her, that they were\r\nboth in God’s hands; and for the first time on hearing this, Mrs.\r\nWilkins was afraid.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but to get out. Useless to try to go on\r\nsitting in the fly repeating San Salvatore. Every time they said it,\r\nand their voices each time were fainter, Beppo and the other man merely\r\nechoed it in a series of loud shouts. If only they had learned Italian\r\nwhen they were little. If only they could have said, “We wish to be\r\ndriven to the door.” But they did not even know what door was in\r\nItalian. Such ignorance was not only contemptible, it was, they now\r\nsaw, definitely dangerous. Useless, however, to lament it now. Useless\r\nto put off whatever it was that was going to happen to them by trying\r\nto go on sitting in the fly. They therefore got out.\r\n\r\nThe two men opened their umbrellas for them and handed them to them.\r\nFrom this they received a faint encouragement, because they could not\r\nbelieve that if these men were wicked they would pause to open\r\numbrellas. The man with the lantern then made signs to them to follow\r\nhim, talking loud and quickly, and Beppo, they noticed, remained\r\nbehind. Ought they to pay him? Not, they thought, if they were going to\r\nbe robbed and perhaps murdered. Surely on such an occasion one did not\r\npay. Besides, he had not after all brought them to San Salvatore. Where\r\nthey had got to was evidently somewhere else. Also, he did not show the\r\nleast wish to be paid; he let them go away into the night with no\r\nclamour at all. This, they could not help thinking, was a bad sign. He\r\nasked for nothing because presently he was to get so much.\r\n\r\nThey came to some steps. The road ended abruptly in a church and some\r\ndescending steps. The man held the lantern low for them to see the\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n“San Salvatore?” said Mrs. Wilkins once again, very faintly, before\r\ncommitting herself to the steps. It was useless to mention it now, of\r\ncourse, but she could not go down steps in complete silence. No\r\nmediaeval castle, she was sure, was ever built at the bottom of steps.\r\n\r\nAgain, however, came the echoing shout—“_Sì, sì_—San Salvatore.”\r\n\r\nThey descended gingerly, holding up their skirts just as if they would\r\nbe wanting them another time and had not in all probability finished\r\nwith skirts for ever.\r\n\r\nThe steps ended in a steeply sloping path with flat stone slabs down\r\nthe middle. They slipped a good deal on these wet slabs, and the man\r\nwith the lantern, talking loud and quickly, held them up. His way of\r\nholding them up was polite.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Mrs. Wilkins in a low voice to Mrs. Arbuthnot, “It is\r\nall right after all.”\r\n\r\n“We’re in God’s hands,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot again; and again Mrs.\r\nWilkins was afraid.\r\n\r\nThey reached the bottom of the sloping path, and the light of the\r\nlantern flickered over an open space with houses round three sides. The\r\nsea was the fourth side, lazily washing backwards and forwards on\r\npebbles.\r\n\r\n“San Salvatore,” said the man pointing with his lantern to a black mass\r\ncurved round the water like an arm flung about it.\r\n\r\nThey strained their eyes. They saw the black mass, and on the top of it\r\na light.\r\n\r\n“San Salvatore?” they both repeated incredulously, for where were the\r\nsuit-cases, and why had they been forced to get out of the fly?\r\n\r\n“_Sì, sì_—San Salvatore.”\r\n\r\nThey went along what seemed to be a quay, right on the edge of the\r\nwater. There was not even a low wall here—nothing to prevent the man\r\nwith the lantern tipping them in if he wanted to. He did not, however,\r\ntip them in. Perhaps it was all right after all, Mrs. Wilkins again\r\nsuggested to Mrs. Arbuthnot on noticing this, who this time was herself\r\nbeginning to think that it might be, and said no more about God’s\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe flicker of the lantern danced along, reflected in the wet pavement\r\nof the quay. Out to the left, in the darkness and evidently at the end\r\nof a jetty, was a red light. They came to an archway with a heavy iron\r\ngate. The man with the lantern pushed the gate open. This time they\r\nwent up steps instead of down, and at the top of them was a little path\r\nthat wound upwards among flowers. They could not see the flowers, but\r\nthe whole place was evidently full of them.\r\n\r\nIt here dawned on Mrs. Wilkins that perhaps the reason why the fly had\r\nnot driven them up to the door was that there was no road, only a\r\nfootpath. That also would explain the disappearance of the suit-cases.\r\nShe began to feel confident that they would find their suit-cases\r\nwaiting for them when they got up to the top. San Salvatore was, it\r\nseemed, on the top of a hill, as a mediaeval castle should be. At a\r\nturn of the path they saw above them, much nearer now and shining more\r\nbrightly, the light they had seen from the quay. She told Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot of her dawning belief, and Mrs. Arbuthnot agreed that it was\r\nvery likely a true one.\r\n\r\nOnce more, but this time in a tone of real hopefulness, Mrs. Wilkins\r\nsaid, pointing upwards at the black outline against the only slightly\r\nless black sky, “San Salvatore?” And once more, but this time\r\ncomfortingly, encouragingly, came back the assurance, “_Sì, sì_—San\r\nSalvatore.”\r\n\r\nThey crossed a little bridge, over what was apparently a ravine, and\r\nthen came a flat bit with long grass at the sides and more flowers.\r\nThey felt the grass flicking wet against their stockings, and the\r\ninvisible flowers were everywhere. Then up again through trees, along a\r\nzigzag path with the smell all the way of the flowers they could not\r\nsee. The warm rain was bringing out all the sweetness. Higher and\r\nhigher they went in this sweet darkness, and the red light on the jetty\r\ndropped farther and farther below them.\r\n\r\nThe path wound round to the other side of what appeared to be a little\r\npeninsula; the jetty and the red light disappeared; across the\r\nemptiness on their left were distant lights.\r\n\r\n“Mezzago,” said the man, waving his lantern at the lights.\r\n\r\n“_Sì, sì_,” they answered, for they had by now learned “_sì, sì_”. Upon\r\nwhich the man congratulated them in a great flow of polite words, not\r\none of which they understood, on their magnificent Italian; for this\r\nwas Domenico, the vigilant and accomplished gardener of San Salvatore,\r\nthe prop and stay of the establishment, the resourceful, the gifted,\r\nthe eloquent, the courteous, the intelligent Domenico. Only they did\r\nnot know that yet; and he did in the dark, and even sometimes in the\r\nlight, look, with his knife-sharp swarthy features and swift, panther\r\nmovements, very like somebody wicked.\r\n\r\nThey passed along another flat bit of path, with a black shape like a\r\nhigh wall towering above them on their right, and then the path went up\r\nagain under trellises, and trailing sprays of scented things caught at\r\nthem and shook raindrops on them, and the light of the lantern\r\nflickered over lilies, and then came a flight of ancient steps worn\r\nwith centuries, and then another iron gate, and then they were inside,\r\nthough still climbing a twisting flight of stone steps with old walls\r\non either side like the walls of dungeons, and with a vaulted roof.\r\n\r\nAt the top was a wrought-iron door, and through it shone a flood of\r\nelectric light.\r\n\r\n“_Ecco_,” said Domenico, lithely running up the last few steps ahead\r\nand pushing the door open.\r\n\r\nAnd there they were, arrived; and it was San Salvatore; and their\r\nsuit-cases were waiting for them; and they had not been murdered.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other’s white faces and blinking eyes very\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\nIt was a great, a wonderful moment. Here they were, in their mediaeval\r\ncastle at last. Their feet touched its stones.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins put her arm round Mrs. Arbuthnot’s neck and kissed her.\r\n\r\n“The first thing to happen in this house,” she said softly, solemnly,\r\n“shall be a kiss.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Lotty,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“Dear Rose,” said Mrs. Wilkins, her eyes brimming with gladness.\r\n\r\nDomenico was delighted. He liked to see beautiful ladies kiss. He made\r\nthem a most appreciative speech of welcome, and they stood arm in arm,\r\nholding each other up, for they were very tired, blinking smilingly at\r\nhim, and not understanding a word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Wilkins woke next morning she lay in bed a few minutes before\r\ngetting up and opening the shutters. What would she see out of her\r\nwindow? A shining world, or a world of rain? But it would be beautiful;\r\nwhatever it was would be beautiful.\r\n\r\nShe was in a little bedroom with bare white walls and a stone floor\r\nand sparse old furniture. The beds—there were two—were made of iron,\r\nenamelled black and painted with bunches of gay flowers. She lay\r\nputting off the great moment of going to the window as one puts off\r\nopening a precious letter, gloating over it. She had no idea what time\r\nit was; she had forgotten to wind up her watch ever since, centuries\r\nago, she last went to bed in Hampstead. No sounds were to be heard in\r\nthe house, so she supposed it was very early, yet she felt as if she\r\nhad slept a long while—so completely rested, so perfectly content.\r\nShe lay with her arms clasped round her head thinking how happy she\r\nwas, her lips curved upwards in a delighted smile. In bed by herself:\r\nadorable condition. She had not been in a bed without Mellersh once\r\nnow for five whole years; and the cool roominess of it, the freedom\r\nof one’s movements, the sense of recklessness, of audacity, in giving\r\nthe blankets a pull if one wanted to, or twitching the pillows more\r\ncomfortably! It was like the discovery of an entirely new joy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins longed to get up and open the shutters, but where she was\r\nwas really so very delicious. She gave a sigh of contentment, and went\r\non lying there looking round her, taking in everything in her room, her\r\nown little room, her very own to arrange just as she pleased for this\r\none blessed month, her room bought with her own savings, the fruit of\r\nher careful denials, whose door she could bolt if she wanted to, and\r\nnobody had the right to come in. It was such a strange little room, so\r\ndifferent from any she had known, and so sweet. It was like a cell.\r\nExcept for the two beds, it suggested a happy austerity. “And the name\r\nof the chamber,” she thought, quoting and smiling round at it, “was\r\nPeace.”\r\n\r\nWell, this was delicious, to lie there thinking how happy she was, but\r\noutside those shutters it was more delicious still. She jumped up,\r\npulled on her slippers, for there was nothing on the stone floor but\r\none small rug, ran to the window and threw open the shutters.\r\n\r\n“_Oh!_” cried Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\nAll the radiance of April in Italy lay gathered together at her feet.\r\nThe sun poured in on her. The sea lay asleep in it, hardly stirring.\r\nAcross the bay the lovely mountains, exquisitely different in colour,\r\nwere asleep too in the light; and underneath her window, at the bottom\r\nof the flower-starred grass slope from which the wall of the castle\r\nrose up, was a great cypress, cutting through the delicate blues and\r\nviolets and rose-colours of the mountains and the sea like a great\r\nblack sword.\r\n\r\nShe stared. Such beauty; and she there to see it. Such beauty; and she\r\nalive to feel it. Her face was bathed in light. Lovely scents came up\r\nto the window and caressed her. A tiny breeze gently lifted her hair.\r\nFar out in the bay a cluster of almost motionless fishing boats hovered\r\nlike a flock of white birds on the tranquil sea. How beautiful, how\r\nbeautiful. Not to have died before this . . . to have been allowed to\r\nsee, breathe, feel this. . . . She stared, her lips parted. Happy?\r\nPoor, ordinary, everyday word. But what could one say, how could one\r\ndescribe it? It was as though she could hardly stay inside herself, it\r\nwas as though she were too small to hold so much of joy, it was as\r\nthough she were washed through with light. And how astonishing to feel\r\nthis sheer bliss, for here she was, not doing and not going to do a\r\nsingle unselfish thing, not going to do a thing she didn’t want to do.\r\nAccording to everybody she had ever come across she ought at least to\r\nhave twinges. She had not one twinge. Something was wrong somewhere.\r\nWonderful that at home she should have been so good, so terribly good,\r\nand merely felt tormented. Twinges of every sort had there been her\r\nportion; aches, hurts, discouragements, and she the whole time being\r\nsteadily unselfish. Now she had taken off all her goodness and left it\r\nbehind her like a heap of rain-sodden clothes, and she only felt joy.\r\nShe was naked of goodness, and was rejoicing in being naked. She was\r\nstripped, and exulting. And there, away in the dim mugginess of\r\nHampstead, was Mellersh being angry.\r\n\r\nShe tried to visualise Mellersh, she tried to see him having breakfast\r\nand thinking bitter things about her; and lo, Mellersh himself began to\r\nshimmer, became rose-colour, became delicate violet, became an\r\nenchanting blue, became formless, became iridescent. Actually Mellersh,\r\nafter quivering a minute, was lost in light.\r\n\r\n“_Well_,” thought Mrs. Wilkins, staring, as it were, after him. How\r\nextraordinary not to be able to visualise Mellersh; and she who used to\r\nknow every feature, every expression of his by heart. She simply could\r\nnot see him as he was. She could only see him resolved into beauty,\r\nmelted into harmony with everything else. The familiar words of the\r\nGeneral Thanksgiving came quite naturally into her mind, and she found\r\nherself blessing God for her creation, preservation, and all the\r\nblessings of this life, but above all for His inestimable Love; out\r\nloud; in a burst of acknowledgment. While Mellersh, at that moment\r\nangrily pulling on his boots before going out into the dripping\r\nstreets, was indeed thinking bitter things about her.\r\n\r\nShe began to dress, choosing clean white clothes in honour of the\r\nsummer’s day, unpacking her suit-cases, tidying her adorable little\r\nroom. She moved about with quick, purposeful steps, her long thin body\r\nheld up straight, her small face, so much puckered at home with effort\r\nand fear, smoothed out. All she had been and done before this morning,\r\nall she had felt and worried about, was gone. Each of her worries\r\nbehaved as the image of Mellersh had behaved, and dissolved into colour\r\nand light. And she noticed things she had not noticed for years—when\r\nshe was doing her hair in front of the glass she noticed it, and\r\nthought, “Why, what pretty stuff.” For years she had forgotten she had\r\nsuch a thing as hair, plaiting it in the evening and unplaiting it in\r\nthe morning with the same hurry and indifference with which she laced\r\nand unlaced her shoes. Now she suddenly saw it, and she twisted it\r\nround her fingers before the glass, and was glad it was so pretty.\r\nMellersh couldn’t have seen it either, for he had never said a word\r\nabout it. Well, when she got home she would draw his attention to it.\r\n“Mellersh,” she would say, “look at my hair. Aren’t you pleased you’ve\r\ngot a wife with hair like curly honey?”\r\n\r\nShe laughed. She had never said anything like that to Mellersh yet, and\r\nthe idea of it amused her. But why had she not? Oh yes—she used to be\r\nafraid of him. Funny to be afraid of anybody; and especially of one’s\r\nhusband, whom one saw in his more simplified moments, such as asleep,\r\nand not breathing properly through his nose.\r\n\r\nWhen she was ready she opened her door to go across to see if Rose, who\r\nhad been put the night before by a sleepy maidservant into a cell\r\nopposite, were awake. She would say good-morning to her, and then she\r\nwould run down and stay with that cypress tree till breakfast was\r\nready, and after breakfast she wouldn’t so much as look out of a window\r\ntill she had helped Rose get everything ready for Lady Caroline and\r\nMrs. Fisher. There was much to be done that day, settling in, arranging\r\nthe rooms; she mustn’t leave Rose to do it alone. They would make it\r\nall so lovely for the two to come, have such an entrancing vision ready\r\nfor them of little cells bright with flowers. She remembered she had\r\nwanted Lady Caroline not to come; fancy wanting to shut some one out of\r\nheaven because she thought she would be shy of her! And as though it\r\nmattered if she were, and as though she would be anything so\r\nself-conscious as shy. Besides, what a reason. She could not accuse\r\nherself of goodness over that. And she remembered she had wanted not to\r\nhave Mrs. Fisher either, because she had seemed lofty. How funny of\r\nher. So funny to worry about such little things, making them important.\r\n\r\nThe bedrooms and two of the sitting-rooms at San Salvatore were on the\r\ntop floor, and opened into a roomy hall with a wide glass window at the\r\nnorth end. San Salvatore was rich in small gardens in different parts\r\nand on different levels. The garden this window looked down on was made\r\non the highest part of the walls, and could only be reached through the\r\ncorresponding spacious hall on the floor below. When Mrs. Wilkins came\r\nout of her room this window stood wide open, and beyond it in the sun\r\nwas a Judas tree in full flower. There was no sign of anybody, no sound\r\nof voices or feet. Tubs of arum lilies stood about on the stone floor,\r\nand on a table flamed a huge bunch of fierce nasturtiums. Spacious,\r\nflowery, silent, with the wide window at the end opening into the\r\ngarden, and the Judas tree absurdly beautiful in the sunshine, it\r\nseemed to Mrs. Wilkins, arrested on her way across to Mrs. Arbuthnot,\r\ntoo good to be true. Was she really going to live in this for a whole\r\nmonth? Up to now she had had to take what beauty she could as she went\r\nalong, snatching at little bits of it when she came across it—a patch\r\nof daisies on a fine day in a Hampstead field, a flash of sunset\r\nbetween two chimney pots. She had never been in definitely, completely\r\nbeautiful places. She had never been even in a venerable house; and\r\nsuch a thing as a profusion of flowers in her rooms was unattainable to\r\nher. Sometimes in the spring she had bought six tulips at Shoolbred’s,\r\nunable to resist them, conscious that Mellersh if he knew what they had\r\ncost would think it inexcusable; but they had soon died, and then there\r\nwere no more. As for the Judas tree, she hadn’t an idea what it was,\r\nand gazed at it out there against the sky with the rapt expression of\r\none who sees a heavenly vision.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot, coming out of her room, found her there like that,\r\nstanding in the middle of the hall staring.\r\n\r\n“Now what does she think she sees now?” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“We _are_ in God’s hands,” said Mrs. Wilkins, turning to her, speaking\r\nwith extreme conviction.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Mrs. Arbuthnot quickly, her face, which had been covered\r\nwith smiles when she came out of her room, falling. “Why, what has\r\nhappened?”\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. Arbuthnot had woken up with such a delightful feeling of\r\nsecurity, of relief, and she did not want to find she had not after all\r\nescaped from the need of refuge. She had not even dreamed of Frederick.\r\nFor the first time for years she had been spared the nightly dream that\r\nhe was with her, that they were heart to heart, and its miserable\r\nawakening. She had slept like a baby, and had woken up confident; she\r\nhad found there was nothing she wished to say in her morning prayer\r\nexcept Thank you. It was disconcerting to be told she was after all in\r\nGod’s hands.\r\n\r\n“I hope nothing has happened?” she asked anxiously.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins looked at her a moment, and laughed. “How funny,” she\r\nsaid, kissing her.\r\n\r\n“What is funny?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, her face clearing because Mrs.\r\nWilkins laughed.\r\n\r\n“We are. This is. Everything. It’s all so wonderful. It’s so funny and\r\nso adorable that we should be in it. I daresay when we finally reach\r\nheaven—the one they talk about so much—we shan’t find it a bit more\r\nbeautiful.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot relaxed to smiling security again. “Isn’t it divine?”\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n“Were you ever, ever in your life so happy?” asked Mrs. Wilkins,\r\ncatching her by the arm.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. Nor had she been; not ever; not even in her\r\nfirst love-days with Frederick. Because always pain had been close at\r\nhand in that other happiness, ready to torture with doubts, to torture\r\neven with the very excess of her love; while this was the simple\r\nhappiness of complete harmony with her surroundings, the happiness that\r\nasks for nothing, that just accepts, just breathes, just is.\r\n\r\n“Let’s go and look at that tree close,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “I don’t\r\nbelieve it can only be a tree.”\r\n\r\nAnd arm in arm they went along the hall, and their husbands would not\r\nhave known them their faces were so young with eagerness, and together\r\nthey stood at the open window, and when their eyes, having feasted on\r\nthe marvellous pink thing, wandered farther among the beauties of the\r\ngarden, they saw sitting on the low wall at the east edge of it, gazing\r\nout over the bay, her feet in lilies, Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nThey were astonished. They said nothing in their astonishment, but\r\nstood quite still, arm in arm, staring down at her.\r\n\r\nShe too had on a white frock, and her head was bare. They had had no\r\nidea that day in London, when her hat was down to her nose and her furs\r\nwere up to her ears, that she was so pretty. They had merely thought\r\nher different from the other women in the club, and so had the other\r\nwomen themselves, and so had all the waitresses, eyeing her sideways\r\nand eyeing her again as they passed the corner where she sat talking;\r\nbut they had had no idea she was so pretty. She was exceedingly pretty.\r\nEverything about her was very much that which it was. Her fair hair was\r\nvery fair, her lovely grey eyes were very lovely and grey, her dark\r\neyelashes were very dark, her white skin was very white, her red mouth\r\nwas very red. She was extravagantly slender—the merest thread of a\r\ngirl, though not without little curves beneath her thin frock where\r\nlittle curves should be. She was looking out across the bay, and was\r\nsharply defined against the background of empty blue. She was full in\r\nthe sun. Her feet dangled among the leaves and flowers of the lilies\r\njust as if it did not matter that they should be bent or bruised.\r\n\r\n“She ought to have a headache,” whispered Mrs. Arbuthnot at last,\r\n“sitting there in the sun like that.”\r\n\r\n“She ought to have a hat,” whispered Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“She’s treading on lilies.”\r\n\r\n“But they’re hers as much as ours.”\r\n\r\n“Only one-fourth of them.”\r\n\r\nLady Caroline turned her head. She looked up at them a moment,\r\nsurprised to see them so much younger than they had seemed that day at\r\nthe club, and so much less unattractive. Indeed, they were really\r\nalmost quite attractive, if any one could ever be really quite\r\nattractive in the wrong clothes. Her eyes, swiftly glancing over them,\r\ntook in every inch of each of them in the half second before she smiled\r\nand waved her hand and called out Good-morning. There was nothing, she\r\nsaw at once, to be hoped for in the way of interest from their clothes.\r\nShe did not consciously think this, for she was having a violent\r\nreaction against beautiful clothes and the slavery they impose on one,\r\nher experience being that the instant one had got them they took one in\r\nhand and gave one no peace till they had been everywhere and been seen\r\nby everybody. You didn’t take your clothes to parties; they took you.\r\nIt was quite a mistake to think that a woman, a really well-dressed\r\nwoman, wore out her clothes; it was the clothes that wore out the\r\nwoman—dragging her about at all hours of the day and night. No wonder\r\nmen stayed young longer. Just new trousers couldn’t excite them. She\r\ncouldn’t suppose that even the newest trousers ever behaved like that,\r\ntaking the bit between their teeth. Her images were disorderly, but she\r\nthought as she chose, she used what images she liked. As she got off the\r\nwall and came towards the window, it seemed a restful thing to know she\r\nwas going to spend an entire month with people in dresses made as she\r\ndimly remembered dresses used to be made five summers ago.\r\n\r\n“I got here yesterday morning,” she said, looking up at them and\r\nsmiling. She really was bewitching. She had everything, even a dimple.\r\n\r\n“It’s a great pity,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smiling back, “because we\r\nwere going to choose the nicest room for you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I’ve done that,” said Lady Caroline. “At least, I think it’s\r\nthe nicest. It looks two ways—I adore a room that looks two ways, don’t\r\nyou? Over the sea to the west, and over this Judas tree to the north.”\r\n\r\n“And we had meant to make it pretty for you with flowers,” said Mrs.\r\nWilkins.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Domenico did that. I told him to directly I got here. He’s the\r\ngardener. He’s wonderful.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a good thing, of course,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot a little\r\nhesitatingly, “to be independent, and to know exactly what one wants.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it saves trouble,” agreed Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\n“But one shouldn’t be so independent,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “as to leave\r\nno opportunity for other people to exercise their benevolences on one.”\r\n\r\nLady Caroline, who had been looking at Mrs. Arbuthnot, now looked at\r\nMrs. Wilkins. That day at that queer club she had had merely a blurred\r\nimpression of Mrs. Wilkins, for it was the other one who did all the\r\ntalking, and her impression had been of somebody so shy, so awkward\r\nthat it was best to take no notice of her. She had not even been able\r\nto say good-bye properly, doing it in an agony, turning red, turning\r\ndamp. Therefore she now looked at her in some surprise; and she was\r\nstill more surprised when Mrs. Wilkins added, gazing at her with the\r\nmost obvious sincere admiration, speaking indeed with a conviction that\r\nrefused to remain unuttered, “I didn’t realise you were _so_ pretty.”\r\n\r\nShe stared at Mrs. Wilkins. She was not usually told this quite so\r\nimmediately and roundly. Abundantly as she was used to it—impossible\r\nnot to be after twenty-eight solid years—it surprised her to be told it\r\nwith such bluntness, and by a woman.\r\n\r\n“It’s very kind of you to think so,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Why, you’re lovely,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “Quite, quite lovely.”\r\n\r\n“I hope,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot pleasantly, “you make the most of it.”\r\n\r\nLady Caroline then stared at Mrs. Arbuthnot. “Oh yes,” she said. “I\r\nmake the most of it. I’ve been doing that ever since I can remember.”\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smiling and raising a warning\r\nforefinger, “it won’t last.”\r\n\r\nThen Lady Caroline began to be afraid these two were originals. If so,\r\nshe would be bored. Nothing bored her so much as people who insisted\r\non being original, who came and buttonholed her and kept her waiting\r\nwhile they were being original. And the one who admired her—it would\r\nbe tiresome if she dogged her about in order to look at her. What\r\nshe wanted of this holiday was complete escape from all she had had\r\nbefore, she wanted the rest of complete contrast. Being admired, being\r\ndogged, wasn’t contrast, it was repetition; and as for originals, to\r\nfind herself shut up with two on the top of a precipitous hill in a\r\nmediaeval castle built for the express purpose of preventing easy\r\ngoings out and in, would not, she was afraid, be especially restful.\r\nPerhaps she had better be a little less encouraging. They had seemed\r\nsuch timid creatures, even the dark one—she couldn’t remember their\r\nnames—that day at the club, that she had felt it quite safe to be very\r\nfriendly. Here they had come out of their shells; already; indeed, at\r\nonce. There was no sign of timidity about either of them here. If they\r\nhad got out of their shells so immediately, at the very first contact,\r\nunless she checked them they would soon begin to press upon her, and\r\nthen good-bye to her dream of thirty restful, silent days, lying\r\nunmolested in the sun, getting her feathers smooth again, not being\r\nspoken to, not waited on, not grabbed at and monopolised, but just\r\nrecovering from the fatigue, the deep and melancholy fatigue, of the\r\ntoo much.\r\n\r\nBesides, there was Mrs. Fisher. She too must be checked. Lady Caroline\r\nhad started two days earlier than had been arranged for two reasons:\r\nfirst, because she wished to arrive before the others in order to pick\r\nout the room or rooms she preferred, and second, because she judged it\r\nlikely that otherwise she would have to travel with Mrs. Fisher. She\r\ndid not want to travel with Mrs. Fisher. She did not want to arrive\r\nwith Mrs. Fisher. She saw no reason whatever why for a single moment\r\nshe should have to have anything at all to do with Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately Mrs. Fisher also was filled with a desire to get to\r\nSan Salvatore first and pick out the room or rooms she preferred, and\r\nshe and Lady Caroline had after all travelled together. As early as\r\nCalais they began to suspect it; in Paris they feared it; at Modane\r\nthey knew it; at Mezzago they concealed it, driving out to Castagneto\r\nin two separate flys, the nose of the one almost touching the back of\r\nthe other the whole way. But when the road suddenly left off at the\r\nchurch and the steps, further evasion was impossible; and faced by this\r\nabrupt and difficult finish to their journey there was nothing for it\r\nbut to amalgamate.\r\n\r\nBecause of Mrs. Fisher’s stick Lady Caroline had to see about\r\neverything. Mrs. Fisher’s intentions, she explained from her fly when\r\nthe situation had become plain to her, were active, but her stick\r\nprevented their being carried out. The two drivers told Lady Caroline\r\nboys would have to carry the luggage up to the castle, and she went in\r\nsearch of some, while Mrs. Fisher waited in the fly because of her\r\nstick. Mrs. Fisher could speak Italian, but only, she explained, the\r\nItalian of Dante, which Matthew Arnold used to read with her when she\r\nwas a girl, and she thought this might be above the heads of boys.\r\nTherefore Lady Caroline, who spoke ordinary Italian very well, was\r\nobviously the one to go and do things.\r\n\r\n“I am in your hands,” said Mrs. Fisher, sitting firmly in her fly. “You\r\nmust please regard me as merely an old woman with a stick.”\r\n\r\nAnd presently, down the steps and cobbles to the piazza, and along the\r\nquay, and up the zigzag path, Lady Caroline found herself as much\r\nobliged to walk slowly with Mrs. Fisher as if she were her own\r\ngrandmother.\r\n\r\n“It’s my stick,” Mrs. Fisher complacently remarked at intervals.\r\n\r\nAnd when they rested at those bends of the zigzag path where seats\r\nwere, and Lady Caroline, who would have liked to run on and get to the\r\ntop quickly, was forced in common humanity to remain with Mrs. Fisher\r\nbecause of her stick, Mrs. Fisher told her how she had been on a zigzag\r\npath once with Tennyson.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t his cricket wonderful?” said Lady Caroline absently.\r\n\r\n“_The_ Tennyson,” said Mrs. Fisher, turning her head and observing her\r\na moment over her spectacles.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t he?” said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\n“I am speaking,” said Mrs. Fisher, “of Alfred.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\n“And it was a path, too,” Mrs. Fisher went on severely, “curiously like\r\nthis. No eucalyptus tree, of course, but otherwise curiously like this.\r\nAnd at one of the bends he turned and said to me—I see him now turning\r\nand saying to me—”\r\n\r\nYes, Mrs. Fisher would have to be checked. And so would these two up at\r\nthe window. She had better begin at once. She was sorry she had got off\r\nthe wall. All she need have done was to have waved her hand, and waited\r\ntill they came down and out into the garden to her.\r\n\r\nSo she ignored Mrs. Arbuthnot’s remark and raised forefinger, and said\r\nwith marked coldness—at least, she tried to make it sound marked—that\r\nshe supposed they would be going to breakfast, and that she had had\r\nhers; but it was her fate that however coldly she sent forth her words\r\nthey came out sounding quite warm and agreeable. That was because she\r\nhad a sympathetic and delightful voice, due entirely to some special\r\nformation of her throat and the roof of her mouth, and having nothing\r\nwhatever to do with what she was feeling. Nobody in consequence ever\r\nbelieved they were being snubbed. It was most tiresome. And if she\r\nstared icily it did not look icy at all, because her eyes, lovely to\r\nbegin with, had the added loveliness of very long, soft, dark\r\neyelashes. No icy stare could come out of eyes like that; it got caught\r\nand lost in the soft eyelashes, and the persons stared at merely\r\nthought they were being regarded with a flattering and exquisite\r\nattentiveness. And if ever she was out of humour or definitely\r\ncross—and who would not be sometimes in such a world?—she only looked\r\nso pathetic that people all rushed to comfort her, if possible by means\r\nof kissing. It was more than tiresome, it was maddening. Nature was\r\ndetermined that she should look and sound angelic. She could never be\r\ndisagreeable or rude without being completely misunderstood.\r\n\r\n“I had my breakfast in my room,” she said, trying her utmost to sound\r\ncurt. “Perhaps I’ll see you later.”\r\n\r\nAnd she nodded, and went back to where she had been sitting on the\r\nwall, with the lilies being nice and cool round her feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir eyes followed her admiringly. They had no idea they had been\r\nsnubbed. It was a disappointment, of course, to find she had\r\nforestalled them and that they were not to have the happiness of\r\npreparing for her, of watching her face when she arrived and first saw\r\neverything, but there was still Mrs. Fisher. They would concentrate on\r\nMrs. Fisher, and would watch her face instead; only, like everybody\r\nelse, they would have preferred to watch Lady Caroline’s.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, then, as Lady Caroline had talked of breakfast, they had\r\nbetter begin by going and having it, for there was too much to be done\r\nthat day to spend any more time gazing at the scenery—servants to be\r\ninterviewed, the house to be gone through and examined, and finally\r\nMrs. Fisher’s room to be got ready and adorned.\r\n\r\nThey waved their hands gaily at Lady Caroline, who seemed absorbed in\r\nwhat she saw and took no notice, and turning away found the maidservant\r\nof the night before had come up silently behind them in cloth slippers\r\nwith string soles.\r\n\r\nShe was Francesca, the elderly parlour-maid, who had been with the\r\nowner, he had said, for years, and whose presence made inventories\r\nunnecessary; and after wishing them good-morning and hoping they had\r\nslept well, she told them breakfast was ready in the dining-room on the\r\nfloor below, and if they would follow her she would lead.\r\n\r\nThey did not understand a single word of the very many in which\r\nFrancesca succeeded in clothing this simple information, but they\r\nfollowed her, for it at least was clear that they were to follow, and\r\ngoing down the stairs, and along the broad hall like the one above\r\nexcept for glass doors at the end instead of a window opening into the\r\ngarden, they were shown into the dining-room; where, sitting at the\r\nhead of the table having her breakfast, was Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\nThis time they exclaimed. Even Mrs. Arbuthnot exclaimed, though her\r\nexclamation was only “Oh.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins exclaimed at greater length. “Why, but it’s like having\r\nthe bread taken out of one’s mouth!” exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“How do you do,” said Mrs. Fisher. “I can’t get up because of my\r\nstick.” And she stretched out her hand across the table.\r\n\r\nThey advanced and shook it.\r\n\r\n“We had no idea you were here,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Fisher, resuming her breakfast. “Yes. I am here.” And\r\nwith composure she removed the top of her egg.\r\n\r\n“It’s a great disappointment,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “We had meant to give\r\nyou _such_ a welcome.”\r\n\r\nThis was the one, Mrs. Fisher remembered, briefly glancing at her, who\r\nwhen she came to Prince of Wales Terrace said she had seen Keats. She\r\nmust be careful with this one—curb her from the beginning.\r\n\r\nShe therefore ignored Mrs. Wilkins and said gravely, with a downward\r\nface of impenetrable calm bent on her egg, “Yes. I arrived yesterday\r\nwith Lady Caroline.”\r\n\r\n“It’s really dreadful,” said Mrs. Wilkins, exactly as if she had not\r\nbeen ignored. “There’s nobody left to get anything ready for now. I\r\nfeel thwarted. I feel as if the bread had been taken out of my mouth\r\njust when I was going to be happy swallowing it.”\r\n\r\n“Where will you sit?” asked Mrs. Fisher of Mrs. Arbuthnot—markedly of\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot; the comparison with the bread seemed to her most\r\nunpleasant.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you—” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, sitting down rather suddenly next\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nThere were only two places she could sit down in, the places laid on\r\neither side of Mrs. Fisher. She therefore sat down in one, and Mrs.\r\nWilkins sat down opposite her in the other.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher was at the head of the table. Round her was grouped the\r\ncoffee and the tea. Of course they were all sharing San Salvatore\r\nequally, but it was she herself and Lotty, Mrs. Arbuthnot mildly\r\nreflected, who had found it, who had had the work of getting it, who\r\nhad chosen to admit Mrs. Fisher into it. Without them, she could not\r\nhelp thinking, Mrs. Fisher would not have been there. Morally Mrs.\r\nFisher was a guest. There was no hostess in this party, but supposing\r\nthere had been a hostess it would not have been Mrs. Fisher, nor Lady\r\nCaroline, it would have been either herself or Lotty. Mrs. Arbuthnot\r\ncould not help feeling this as she sat down, and Mrs. Fisher, the hand\r\nwhich Ruskin had wrung suspended over the pots before her, inquired,\r\n“Tea or coffee?” She could not help feeling it even more definitely\r\nwhen Mrs. Fisher touched a small gong on the table beside her as though\r\nshe had been used to that gong and that table ever since she was\r\nlittle, and, on Francesca’s appearing, bade her in the language of\r\nDante bring more milk. There was a curious air about Mrs. Fisher,\r\nthought Mrs. Arbuthnot, of being in possession; and if she herself had\r\nnot been so happy she would have perhaps minded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins noticed it too, but it only made her discursive brain\r\nthink of cuckoos. She would no doubt immediately have begun to talk of\r\ncuckoos, incoherently, unrestrainably and deplorably, if she had been\r\nin the condition of nerves and shyness she was in last time she saw\r\nMrs. Fisher. But happiness had done away with shyness—she was very\r\nserene; she could control her conversation; she did not have,\r\nhorrified, to listen to herself saying things she had no idea of saying\r\nwhen she began; she was quite at her ease, and completely natural. The\r\ndisappointment of not going to be able to prepare a welcome for Mrs.\r\nFisher had evaporated at once, for it was impossible to go on being\r\ndisappointed in heaven. Nor did she mind her behaving as hostess. What\r\ndid it matter? You did not mind things in heaven. She and Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, therefore, sat down more willingly than they otherwise would\r\nhave done, one on either side of Mrs. Fisher, and the sun, pouring\r\nthrough the two windows facing east across the bay, flooded the room,\r\nand there was an open door leading into the garden, and the garden was\r\nfull of many lovely things, especially freesias.\r\n\r\nThe delicate and delicious fragrance of the freesias came in through\r\nthe door and floated round Mrs. Wilkins’s enraptured nostrils. Freesias\r\nin London were quite beyond her. Occasionally she went into a shop and\r\nasked what they cost, so as just to have an excuse for lifting up a\r\nbunch and smelling them, well knowing that it was something awful like\r\na shilling for about three flowers. Here they were everywhere—bursting\r\nout of every corner and carpeting the rose beds. Imagine it—having\r\nfreesias to pick in armsful if you wanted to, and with glorious\r\nsunshine flooding the room, and in your summer frock, and its being\r\nonly the first of April!\r\n\r\n“I suppose you realise, don’t you, that we’ve got to heaven?” she said,\r\nbeaming at Mrs. Fisher with all the familiarity of a fellow-angel.\r\n\r\n“They are considerably younger than I had supposed,” thought Mrs.\r\nFisher, “and not nearly so plain.” And she mused a moment, while she\r\ntook no notice of Mrs. Wilkins’s exuberance, on their instant and\r\nagitated refusal that day at Prince of Wales Terrace to have anything\r\nto do with the giving or the taking of references.\r\n\r\nNothing could affect her, of course; nothing that anybody did. She was\r\nfar too solidly seated in respectability. At her back stood massively\r\nin a tremendous row those three great names she had offered, and they\r\nwere not the only ones she could turn to for support and countenance.\r\nEven if these young women—she had no grounds for believing the one\r\nout in the garden to be really Lady Caroline Dester, she had merely\r\nbeen told she was—even if these young women should all turn out to be\r\nwhat Browning used to call—how well she remembered his amusing and\r\ndelightful way of putting things—Fly-by-Nights, what could it possibly,\r\nor in any way matter to her? Let them fly by night if they wished. One\r\nwas not sixty-five for nothing. In any case there would only be four\r\nweeks of it, at the end of which she would see no more of them. And in\r\nthe meanwhile there were plenty of places where she could sit quietly\r\naway from them and remember. Also there was her own sitting-room, a\r\ncharming room, all honey-coloured furniture and pictures, with windows\r\nto the sea towards Genoa, and a door opening on to the battlements. The\r\nhouse possessed two sitting-rooms, and she had explained to that pretty\r\ncreature Lady Caroline—certainly a pretty creature, whatever else she\r\nwas; Tennyson would have enjoyed taking her for blows on the downs—who\r\nhad seemed inclined to appropriate the honey-coloured one, that she\r\nneeded some little refuge entirely to herself because of her stick.\r\n\r\n“Nobody wants to see an old woman hobbling about everywhere,” she had\r\nsaid. “I shall be quite content to spend much of my time by myself in\r\nhere or sitting out on these convenient battlements.”\r\n\r\nAnd she had a very nice bedroom, too; it looked two ways, across the\r\nbay to the morning sun—she liked the morning sun—and onto the garden.\r\nThere were only two of these bedrooms with cross-views in the house,\r\nshe and Lady Caroline had discovered, and they were by far the airiest.\r\nThey each had two beds in them, and she and Lady Caroline had had the\r\nextra beds taken out at once and put into two of the other rooms. In\r\nthis way there was much more space and comfort. Lady Caroline, indeed,\r\nhad turned hers into a bed-sitting-room, with the sofa out of the\r\nbigger drawing-room and the writing-table and the most comfortable\r\nchair, but she herself had not had to do that because she had her own\r\nsitting-room, equipped with what was necessary. Lady Caroline had\r\nthought at first of taking the bigger sitting-room entirely for her\r\nown, because the dining-room on the floor below could quite well be\r\nused between meals to sit in by the two others, and was a very pleasant\r\nroom with nice chairs, but she had not liked the bigger sitting-room’s\r\nshape—it was a round room in the tower, with deep slit windows pierced\r\nthrough the massive walls, and a domed and ribbed ceiling arranged to\r\nlook like an open umbrella, and it seemed a little dark. Undoubtedly\r\nLady Caroline had cast covetous glances at the honey-coloured room, and\r\nif she, Mrs. Fisher, had been less firm would have installed herself in\r\nit. Which would have been absurd.\r\n\r\n“I hope,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smilingly making an attempt to convey to\r\nMrs. Fisher that though she, Mrs. Fisher, might not be exactly a guest\r\nshe certainly was not in the very least a hostess, “your room is\r\ncomfortable.”\r\n\r\n“Quite,” said Mrs. Fisher. “Will you have some more coffee?”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you. Will you?”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you. There were two beds in my bedroom, filling it up\r\nunnecessarily, and I had one taken out. It has made it much more\r\nconvenient.”\r\n\r\n“Oh _that’s_ why I’ve got two beds in my room!” exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins,\r\nilluminated; the second bed in her little cell had seemed an unnatural\r\nand inappropriate object from the moment she saw it.\r\n\r\n“I gave no directions,” said Mrs. Fisher, addressing Mrs. Arbuthnot, “I\r\nmerely asked Francesca to remove it.”\r\n\r\n“I have two in my room as well,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“Your second one must be Lady Caroline’s. She had hers removed too,”\r\nsaid Mrs. Fisher. “It seems foolish to have more beds in a room than\r\nthere are occupiers.”\r\n\r\n“But _we_ haven’t got any husbands here either,” said Mrs. Wilkins,\r\n“and I don’t see any use in extra beds in one’s room if one hasn’t got\r\nhusbands to put in them. Can’t we have them taken away too?”\r\n\r\n“Beds,” said Mrs. Fisher coldly, “cannot be removed from one room after\r\nanother. They must remain somewhere.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins’s remarks seemed to Mrs. Fisher persistently unfortunate.\r\nEach time she opened her mouth she said something best left unsaid.\r\nLoose talk about husbands had never in Mrs. Fisher’s circle been\r\nencouraged. In the ’eighties, when she chiefly flourished, husbands\r\nwere taken seriously, as the only real obstacles to sin. Beds too, if\r\nthey had to be mentioned, were approached with caution; and a decent\r\nreserve prevented them and husbands ever being spoken of in the same\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nShe turned more markedly than ever to Mrs. Arbuthnot. “Do let me give\r\nyou a little more coffee,” she said.\r\n\r\n“No, thank you. But won’t you have some more?”\r\n\r\n“No indeed. I never have more than two cups at breakfast. Would you\r\nlike an orange?”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you. Would you?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t eat fruit at breakfast. It is an American fashion which I\r\nam too old now to adopt. Have you had all you want?”\r\n\r\n“Quite. Have you?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher paused before replying. Was this a habit, this trick of\r\nanswering a simple question with the same question? If so it must be\r\ncurbed, for no one could live for four weeks in any real comfort with\r\nsomebody who had a habit.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at Mrs. Arbuthnot, and her parted hair and gentle brow\r\nreassured her. No; it was accident, not habit, that had produced those\r\nechoes. She could as soon imagine a dove having tiresome habits as Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot. Considering her, she thought what a splendid wife she would\r\nhave been for poor Carlyle. So much better than that horrid clever\r\nJane. She would have soothed him.\r\n\r\n“Then shall we go?” she suggested.\r\n\r\n“Let me help you up,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, all consideration.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you—I can manage perfectly. It’s only sometimes that my\r\nstick prevents me—”\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher got up quite easily; Mrs. Arbuthnot had hovered over her\r\nfor nothing.\r\n\r\n“_I’m_ going to have one of these gorgeous oranges,” said Mrs. Wilkins,\r\nstaying where she was and reaching across to a black bowl piled with\r\nthem. “Rose, how can you resist them. Look—have this one. Do have this\r\nbeauty—” And she held out a big one.\r\n\r\n“No, I’m going to see to my duties,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, moving\r\ntowards the door. “You’ll forgive me for leaving you, won’t you,” she\r\nadded politely to Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher moved towards the door too; quite easily; almost quickly;\r\nher stick did not hinder her at all. She had no intention of being left\r\nwith Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“What time would you like to have lunch?” Mrs. Arbuthnot asked her,\r\ntrying to keep her head as at least a non-guest, if not precisely a\r\nhostess, above water.\r\n\r\n“Lunch,” said Mrs. Fisher, “is at half-past twelve.”\r\n\r\n“You shall have it at half-past twelve then,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n“I’ll tell the cook. It will be a great struggle,” she continued,\r\nsmiling, “but I’ve brought a little dictionary—”\r\n\r\n“The cook,” said Mrs. Fisher, “knows.”\r\n\r\n“Oh?” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“Lady Caroline has already told her,” said Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“Oh?” said Mrs. Arbuthnot again.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Lady Caroline speaks the kind of Italian cooks understand. I am\r\nprevented going into the kitchen because of my stick. And even if I\r\nwere able to go, I fear I shouldn’t be understood.”\r\n\r\n“But—” began Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“But it’s _too_ wonderful,” Mrs. Wilkins finished for her from the\r\ntable, delighted with these unexpected simplifications in her and\r\nRose’s lives. “Why, we’ve got positively nothing to do here, either of\r\nus, except just be happy. You wouldn’t believe,” she said, turning her\r\nhead and speaking straight to Mrs. Fisher, portions of orange in either\r\nhand, “how terribly good Rose and I have been for years without\r\nstopping, and how much now we need a perfect rest.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Fisher, going without answering her out of the room, said to\r\nherself, “She must, she shall be curbed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently, when Mrs. Wilkins and Mrs. Arbuthnot, unhampered by any\r\nduties, wandered out and down the worn stone steps and under the\r\npergola into the lower garden, Mrs. Wilkins said to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who\r\nseemed pensive, “Don’t you see that if somebody else does the ordering\r\nit frees us?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot said she did see, but nevertheless she thought it rather\r\nsilly to have everything taken out of their hands.\r\n\r\n“I love things to be taken out of my hands,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“But we found San Salvatore,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, “and it is rather\r\nsilly that Mrs. Fisher should behave as if it belonged only to her.”\r\n\r\n“What is rather silly,” said Mrs. Wilkins with much serenity, “is to\r\nmind. I can’t see the least point in being in authority at the price of\r\none’s liberty.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot said nothing to that for two reasons—first, because she\r\nwas struck by the remarkable and growing calm of the hitherto\r\nincoherent and excited Lotty, and secondly because what she was looking\r\nat was so very beautiful.\r\n\r\nAll down the stone steps on either side were periwinkles in full\r\nflower, and she could now see what it was that had caught at her the\r\nnight before and brushed, wet and scented, across her face. It was\r\nwistaria. _Wistaria and sunshine_ . . . she remembered the\r\nadvertisement. Here indeed were both in profusion. The wistaria was\r\ntumbling over itself in its excess of life, its prodigality of\r\nflowering; and where the pergola ended the sun blazed on scarlet\r\ngeraniums, bushes of them, and nasturtiums in great heaps, and\r\nmarigolds so brilliant that they seemed to be burning, and red and pink\r\nsnapdragons, all outdoing each other in bright, fierce colour. The\r\nground behind these flaming things dropped away in terraces to the sea,\r\neach terrace a little orchard, where among the olives grew vines on\r\ntrellises, and fig-trees, and peach-trees, and cherry-trees. The\r\ncherry-trees and peach-trees were in blossom—lovely showers of white\r\nand deep rose-colour among the trembling delicacy of the olives; the\r\nfig-leaves were just big enough to smell of figs, the vine-buds were\r\nonly beginning to show. And beneath these trees were groups of blue and\r\npurple irises, and bushes of lavender, and grey, sharp cactuses, and\r\nthe grass was thick with dandelions and daisies, and right down at the\r\nbottom was the sea. Colour seemed flung down anyhow, anywhere; every\r\nsort of colour, piled up in heaps, pouring along in rivers—the\r\nperiwinkles looked exactly as if they were being poured down each side\r\nof the steps—and flowers that grow only in borders in England, proud\r\nflowers keeping themselves to themselves over there, such as the great\r\nblue irises and the lavender, were being jostled by small, shining\r\ncommon things like dandelions and daisies and the white bells of the\r\nwild onion, and only seemed the better and the more exuberant for it.\r\n\r\nThey stood looking at this crowd of loveliness, this happy jumble, in\r\nsilence. No, it didn’t matter what Mrs. Fisher did; not here; not in\r\nsuch beauty. Mrs. Arbuthnot’s discomposure melted out of her. In the\r\nwarmth and light of what she was looking at, of what to her was a\r\nmanifestation, an entirely new side of God, how could one be\r\ndiscomposed? If only Frederick were with her, seeing it too, seeing as\r\nhe would have seen it when first they were lovers, in the days when he\r\nsaw what she saw and loved what she loved. . .\r\n\r\nShe sighed.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t sigh in heaven,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “One doesn’t.”\r\n\r\n“I was thinking how one longs to share this with those one loves,” said\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t long in heaven,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “You’re supposed to be\r\nquite complete there. And it is heaven, isn’t it, Rose? See how\r\neverything has been let in together—the dandelions and the irises, the\r\nvulgar and the superior, me and Mrs. Fisher—all welcome, all mixed up\r\nanyhow, and all so visibly happy and enjoying ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Fisher doesn’t seem happy—not visibly, anyhow,” said Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, smiling.\r\n\r\n“She’ll begin soon, you’ll see.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot said she didn’t believe that after a certain age people\r\nbegan anything.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins said she was sure no one, however old and tough, could\r\nresist the effects of perfect beauty. Before many days, perhaps only\r\nhours, they would see Mrs. Fisher bursting out into every kind of\r\nexuberance. “I’m quite sure,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “that we’ve got to\r\nheaven, and once Mrs. Fisher realises that that’s where she is, she’s\r\nbound to be different. You’ll see. She’ll leave off being ossified, and\r\ngo all soft and able to stretch, and we shall get quite—why, I\r\nshouldn’t be surprised if we get quite fond of her.”\r\n\r\nThe idea of Mrs. Fisher bursting out into anything, she who seemed so\r\nparticularly firmly fixed inside her buttons, made Mrs. Arbuthnot\r\nlaugh. She condoned Lotty’s loose way of talking of heaven, because in\r\nsuch a place, on such a morning, condonation was in the very air.\r\nBesides, what an excuse there was.\r\n\r\nAnd Lady Caroline, sitting where they had left her before breakfast on\r\nthe wall, peeped over when she heard laughter, and saw them standing on\r\nthe path below, and thought what a mercy it was they were laughing down\r\nthere and had not come up and done it round her. She disliked jokes at\r\nall times, but in the morning she hated them; especially close up;\r\nespecially crowding in her ears. She hoped the originals were on their\r\nway out for a walk, and not on their way back from one. They were\r\nlaughing more and more. What could they possibly find to laugh at?\r\n\r\nShe looked down on the tops of their heads with a very serious face,\r\nfor the thought of spending a month with laughers was a grave one, and\r\nthey, as though they felt her eyes, turned suddenly and looked up.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful geniality of those women. . .\r\n\r\nShe shrank away from their smiles and wavings, but she could not shrink\r\nout of sight without falling into the lilies. She neither smiled nor\r\nwaved back, and turning her eyes to the more distant mountains surveyed\r\nthem carefully till the two, tired of waving, moved away along the path\r\nand turned the corner and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis time they both did notice that they had been met with, at least,\r\nunresponsiveness.\r\n\r\n“If we weren’t in heaven,” said Mrs. Wilkins serenely, “I should say we\r\nhad been snubbed, but as nobody snubs anybody there of course we can’t\r\nhave been.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she is unhappy,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“Whatever it is she is she’ll get over it here,” said Mrs. Wilkins with\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n“We must try and help her,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but nobody helps anybody in heaven. That’s finished with. You\r\ndon’t try to be, or do. You simply _are_.”\r\n\r\nWell, Mrs. Arbuthnot wouldn’t go into that—not here, not to-day. The\r\nvicar, she knew, would have called Lotty’s talk levity, if not\r\nprofanity. How old he seemed from here; an old, old vicar.\r\n\r\nThey left the path, and clambered down the olive terraces, down and\r\ndown, to where at the bottom the warm, sleepy sea heaved gently among\r\nthe rocks. There a pine-tree grew close to the water, and they sat\r\nunder it, and a few yards away was a fishing-boat lying motionless and\r\ngreen-bellied on the water. The ripples of the sea made little gurgling\r\nnoises at their feet. They screwed up their eyes to be able to look\r\ninto the blaze of light beyond the shade of their tree. The hot smell\r\nfrom the pine-needles and from the cushions of wild thyme that padded\r\nthe spaces between the rocks, and sometimes a smell of pure honey from\r\na clump of warm irises up behind them in the sun, puffed across their\r\nfaces. Very soon Mrs. Wilkins took her shoes and stockings off, and let\r\nher feet hang in the water. After watching her a minute Mrs. Arbuthnot\r\ndid the same. Their happiness was then complete. Their husbands would\r\nnot have known them. They left off talking. They ceased to mention\r\nheaven. They were just cups of acceptance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lady Caroline, on her wall, was considering her position. The\r\ngarden on the top of the wall was a delicious garden, but its situation\r\nmade it insecure and exposed to interruptions. At any moment the others\r\nmight come and want to use it, because both the hall and the\r\ndining-room had doors opening straight into it. Perhaps, thought Lady\r\nCaroline, she could arrange that it should be solely hers. Mrs. Fisher\r\nhad the battlements, delightful with flowers, and a watch-tower all to\r\nherself, besides having snatched the one really nice room in the house.\r\nThere were plenty of places the originals could go to—she had herself\r\nseen at least two other little gardens, while the hill the castle stood\r\non was itself a garden, with walks and seats. Why should not this one\r\nspot be kept exclusively for her? She liked it; she liked it best of\r\nall. It had the Judas tree and an umbrella pine, it had the freesias\r\nand the lilies, it had a tamarisk beginning to flush pink, it had the\r\nconvenient low wall to sit on, it had from each of its three sides the\r\nmost amazing views—to the east the bay and mountains, to the north the\r\nvillage across the tranquil clear green water of the little harbour and\r\nthe hills dotted with white houses and orange groves, and to the west\r\nwas the thin thread of land by which San Salvatore was tied to the\r\nmainland, and then the open sea and the coast line beyond Genoa\r\nreaching away into the blue dimness of France. Yes, she would say she\r\nwanted to have this entirely to herself. How obviously sensible if each\r\nof them had their own special place to sit in apart. It was essential\r\nto her comfort that she should be able to be apart, left alone, not\r\ntalked to. The others ought to like it best too. Why herd? One had\r\nenough of that in England, with one’s relations and friends—oh, the\r\nnumbers of them!—pressing on one continually. Having successfully\r\nescaped them for four weeks why continue, and with persons having no\r\nearthly claim on one, to herd?\r\n\r\nShe lit a cigarette. She began to feel secure. Those two had gone for a\r\nwalk. There was no sign of Mrs. Fisher. How very pleasant this was.\r\n\r\nSomebody came out through the glass doors, just as she was drawing a\r\ndeep breath of security. Surely it couldn’t be Mrs. Fisher, wanting to\r\nsit with her? Mrs. Fisher had her battlements. She ought to stay on\r\nthem, having snatched them. It would be too tiresome if she wouldn’t,\r\nand wanted not only to have them and her sitting-room but to establish\r\nherself in this garden as well.\r\n\r\nNo; it wasn’t Mrs. Fisher, it was the cook.\r\n\r\nShe frowned. Was she going to have to go on ordering the food? Surely\r\none or other of those two waving women would do that now.\r\n\r\nThe cook, who had been waiting in increasing agitation in the kitchen,\r\nwatching the clock getting nearer to lunch-time while she still was\r\nwithout knowledge of what lunch was to consist of, had gone at last to\r\nMrs. Fisher, who had immediately waved her away. She then wandered\r\nabout the house seeking a mistress, any mistress, who would tell her\r\nwhat to cook, and finding none; and at last, directed by Francesca, who\r\nalways knew where everybody was, came out to Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nDomenico had provided this cook. She was Costanza, the sister of that\r\none of his cousins who kept a restaurant down on the piazza. She helped\r\nher brother in his cooking when she had no other job, and knew every\r\nsort of fat, mysterious Italian dish such as the workmen of Castagneto,\r\nwho crowded the restaurant at midday, and the inhabitants of Mezzago\r\nwhen they came over on Sundays, loved to eat. She was a fleshless\r\nspinster of fifty, grey-haired, nimble, rich of speech, and thought\r\nLady Caroline more beautiful than anyone she had ever seen; and so did\r\nDomenico; and so did the boy Giuseppe who helped Domenico and was,\r\nbesides, his nephew; and so did the girl Angela who helped Francesca\r\nand was, besides, Domenico’s niece; and so did Francesca herself.\r\nDomenico and Francesca, the only two who had seen them, thought the two\r\nladies who arrived last very beautiful, but compared to the fair young\r\nlady who arrived first they were as candles to the electric light that\r\nhad lately been installed, and as the tin tubs in the bedrooms to the\r\nwonderful new bathroom their master had had arranged on his last visit.\r\n\r\nLady Caroline scowled at the cook. The scowl, as usual, was transformed\r\non the way into what appeared to be an intent and beautiful gravity,\r\nand Costanza threw up her hands and took the saints aloud to witness\r\nthat here was the very picture of the Mother of God.\r\n\r\nLady Caroline asked her crossly what she wanted, and Costanza’s head\r\nwent on one side with delight at the sheer music of her voice. She\r\nsaid, after waiting a moment in case the music was going to continue,\r\nfor she didn’t wish to miss any of it, that she wanted orders; she had\r\nbeen to the Signorina’s mother, but in vain.\r\n\r\n“She is not my mother,” repudiated Lady Caroline angrily; and her anger\r\nsounded like the regretful wail of a melodious orphan.\r\n\r\nCostanza poured forth pity. She too, she explained, had no mother—\r\n\r\nLady Caroline interrupted with the curt information that her mother was\r\nalive and in London.\r\n\r\nCostanza praised God and the saints that the young lady did not yet\r\nknow what it was like to be without a mother. Quickly enough did\r\nmisfortunes overtake one; no doubt the young lady already had a\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Lady Caroline icily. Worse than jokes in the morning did she\r\nhate the idea of husbands. And everybody was always trying to press\r\nthem on her—all her relations, all her friends, all the evening papers.\r\nAfter all, she could only marry one, anyhow; but you would think from\r\nthe way everybody talked, and especially those persons who wanted to be\r\nhusbands, that she could marry at least a dozen.\r\n\r\nHer soft, pathetic “No” made Costanza, who was standing close to her,\r\nwell with sympathy.\r\n\r\n“Poor little one,” said Costanza, moved actually to pat her\r\nencouragingly on the shoulder, “take hope. There is still time.”\r\n\r\n“For lunch,” said Lady Caroline freezingly, marvelling as she spoke\r\nthat she should be patted, she who had taken so much trouble to come to\r\na place, remote and hidden, where she could be sure that among other\r\nthings of a like oppressive nature pattings also were not, “we will\r\nhave—”\r\n\r\nCostanza became business-like. She interrupted with suggestions, and\r\nher suggestions were all admirable and all expensive.\r\n\r\nLady Caroline did not know they were expensive, and fell in with them\r\nat once. They sounded very nice. Every sort of young vegetables and\r\nfruits came into them, and much butter and a great deal of cream and\r\nincredible numbers of eggs. Costanza said enthusiastically at the end,\r\nas a tribute to this acquiescence, that of the many ladies and\r\ngentlemen she had worked for on temporary jobs such as this she\r\npreferred the English ladies and gentlemen. She more than preferred\r\nthem—they roused devotion in her. For they knew what to order; they did\r\nnot skimp; they refrained from grinding down the faces of the poor.\r\n\r\nFrom this Lady Caroline concluded that she had been extravagant, and\r\npromptly countermanded the cream.\r\n\r\nCostanza’s face fell, for she had a cousin who had a cow, and the cream\r\nwas to have come from them both.\r\n\r\n“And perhaps we had better not have chickens,” said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nCostanza’s face fell more, for her brother at the restaurant kept\r\nchickens in his back-yard, and many of them were ready for killing.\r\n\r\n“Also do not order strawberries till I have consulted with the other\r\nladies,” said Lady Caroline, remembering that it was only the first of\r\nApril, and that perhaps people who lived in Hampstead might be poor;\r\nindeed, must be poor, or why live in Hampstead? “It is not I who am\r\nmistress here.”\r\n\r\n“Is it the old one?” asked Costanza, her face very long.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\n“Which of the other two ladies is it?”\r\n\r\n“Neither,” said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nThen Costanza’s smiles returned, for the young lady was having fun with\r\nher and making jokes. She told her so, in her friendly Italian way, and\r\nwas genuinely delighted.\r\n\r\n“I never make jokes,” said Lady Caroline briefly. “You had better go,\r\nor lunch will certainly not be ready by half-past twelve.”\r\n\r\nAnd these curt words came out sounding so sweet that Costanza felt as\r\nif kind compliments were being paid her, and forgot her disappointment\r\nabout the cream and the chickens, and went away all gratitude and\r\nsmiles.\r\n\r\n“This,” thought Lady Caroline, “will never do. I haven’t come here to\r\nhousekeep, and I won’t.”\r\n\r\nShe called Costanza back. Costanza came running. The sound of her name\r\nin that voice enchanted her.\r\n\r\n“I have ordered the lunch for to-day,” said Lady Caroline, with the\r\nserious angel face that was hers when she was annoyed, “and I have also\r\nordered the dinner, but from now on you will go to one of the other\r\nladies for orders. I give no more.”\r\n\r\nThe idea that she would go on giving orders was too absurd. She never\r\ngave orders at home. Nobody there dreamed of asking her to do anything.\r\nThat such a very tiresome activity should be thrust upon her here,\r\nsimply because she happened to be able to talk Italian, was ridiculous.\r\nLet the originals give orders if Mrs. Fisher refused to. Mrs. Fisher,\r\nof course, was the one Nature intended for such a purpose. She had the\r\nvery air of a competent housekeeper. Her clothes were the clothes of a\r\nhousekeeper, and so was the way she did her hair.\r\n\r\nHaving delivered herself of her ultimatum with an acerbity that turned\r\nsweet on the way, and accompanied it by a peremptory gesture of\r\ndismissal that had the grace and loving-kindness of a benediction, it\r\nwas annoying that Costanza should only stand still with her head on one\r\nside gazing at her in obvious delight.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _go_ away!” exclaimed Lady Caroline in English, suddenly\r\nexasperated.\r\n\r\nThere had been a fly in her bedroom that morning which had stuck just\r\nas Costanza was sticking; only one, but it might have been a myriad it\r\nwas so tiresome from daylight on. It was determined to settle on her\r\nface, and she was determined it should not. Its persistence was\r\nuncanny. It woke her, and would not let her go to sleep again. She hit\r\nat it, and it eluded her without fuss or effort and with an almost\r\nvisible blandness, and she had only hit herself. It came back again\r\ninstantly, and with a loud buzz alighted on her cheek. She hit at it\r\nagain and hurt herself, while it skimmed gracefully away. She lost her\r\ntemper, and sat up in bed and waited, watching to hit at it and kill\r\nit. She kept on hitting at it at last with fury and with all her\r\nstrength, as if it were a real enemy deliberately trying to madden her;\r\nand it elegantly skimmed in and out of her blows, not even angry, to be\r\nback again the next instant. It succeeded every time in getting on to\r\nher face, and was quite indifferent how often it was driven away. That\r\nwas why she had dressed and come out so early. Francesca had already\r\nbeen told to put a net over her bed, for she was not going to allow\r\nherself to be annoyed twice like that. People were exactly like flies.\r\nShe wished there were nets for keeping them off too. She hit at them\r\nwith words and frowns, and like the fly they slipped between her blows\r\nand were untouched. Worse than the fly, they seemed unaware that she\r\nhad even tried to hit them. The fly at least did for a moment go away.\r\nWith human beings the only way to get rid of them was to go away\r\nherself. That was what, so tired, she had done this April; and having\r\ngot here, having got close up to the details of life at San Salvatore,\r\nit appeared that here, too, she was not to be let alone.\r\n\r\nViewed from London there had seemed to be no details. San Salvatore\r\nfrom there seemed to be an empty, a delicious blank. Yet, after only\r\ntwenty-four hours of it, she was discovering that it was not a blank at\r\nall, and that she was having to ward off as actively as ever. Already\r\nshe had been much stuck to. Mrs. Fisher had stuck nearly the whole of\r\nthe day before, and this morning there had been no peace, not ten\r\nminutes uninterruptedly alone.\r\n\r\nCostanza of course had finally to go because she had to cook, but\r\nhardly had she gone before Domenico came. He came to water and tie up.\r\nThat was natural, since he was the gardener, but he watered and tied up\r\nall the things that were nearest to her; he hovered closer and closer;\r\nhe watered to excess; he tied plants that were as straight and steady\r\nas arrows. Well, at least he was a man, and therefore not quite so\r\nannoying, and his smiling good-morning was received with an answering\r\nsmile; upon which Domenico forgot his family, his wife, his mother, his\r\ngrown-up children and all his duties, and only wanted to kiss the young\r\nlady’s feet.\r\n\r\nHe could not do that, unfortunately, but he could talk while he worked,\r\nand talk he did; voluminously; pouring out every kind of information,\r\nillustrating what he said with gestures so lively that he had to put\r\ndown the watering-pot, and thus delay the end of the watering.\r\n\r\nLady Caroline bore it for a time but presently was unable to bear it,\r\nand as he would not go, and she could not tell him to, seeing that he\r\nwas engaged in his proper work, once again it was she who had to.\r\n\r\nShe got off the wall and moved to the other side of the garden, where\r\nin a wooden shed were some comfortable low cane chairs. All she wanted\r\nwas to turn one of these round with its back to Domenico and its front\r\nto the sea towards Genoa. Such a little thing to want. One would have\r\nthought she might have been allowed to do that unmolested. But he, who\r\nwatched her every movement, when he saw her approaching the chairs\r\ndarted after her and seized one and asked to be told where to put it.\r\n\r\nWould she never get away from being waited on, being made comfortable,\r\nbeing asked where she wanted things put, having to say thank you? She\r\nwas short with Domenico, who instantly concluded the sun had given her\r\na headache, and ran in and fetched her a sunshade and a cushion and a\r\nfootstool, and was skilful, and was wonderful, and was one of Nature’s\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nShe shut her eyes in a heavy resignation. She could not be unkind to\r\nDomenico. She could not get up and walk indoors as she would have done\r\nif it had been one of the others. Domenico was intelligent and very\r\ncompetent. She had at once discovered that it was he who really ran the\r\nhouse, who really did everything. And his manners were definitely\r\ndelightful, and he undoubtedly was a charming person. It was only that\r\nshe did so much long to be let alone. If only, only she could be left\r\nquite quiet for this one month, she felt that she might perhaps make\r\nsomething of herself after all.\r\n\r\nShe kept her eyes shut, because then he would think she wanted to sleep\r\nand would go away.\r\n\r\nDomenico’s romantic Italian soul melted within him at the sight, for\r\nhaving her eyes shut was extraordinarily becoming to her. He stood\r\nentranced, quite still, and she thought he had stolen away, so she\r\nopened them again.\r\n\r\nNo; there he was, staring at her. Even he. There was no getting away\r\nfrom being stared at.\r\n\r\n“I have a headache,” she said, shutting them again.\r\n\r\n“It is the sun,” said Domenico, “and sitting on the wall without a\r\nhat.”\r\n\r\n“I wish to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“_Sì signorina_,” he said sympathetically; and went softly away.\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes with a sigh of relief. The gentle closing of the\r\nglass doors showed her that he had not only gone quite away but had\r\nshut her out in the garden so that she should be undisturbed. Now\r\nperhaps she would be alone till lunch-time.\r\n\r\nIt was very curious, and no one in the world could have been more\r\nsurprised than she herself, but she wanted to think. She had never\r\nwanted to do that before. Everything else that it is possible to do\r\nwithout too much inconvenience she had either wanted to do or had done\r\nat one period or another of her life, but not before had she wanted to\r\nthink. She had come to San Salvatore with the single intention of lying\r\ncomatose for four weeks in the sun, somewhere where her parents and\r\nfriends were not, lapped in forgetfulness, stirring herself only to be\r\nfed, and she had not been there more than a few hours when this strange\r\nnew desire took hold of her.\r\n\r\nThere had been wonderful stars the evening before, and she had gone out\r\ninto the top garden after dinner, leaving Mrs. Fisher alone over her\r\nnuts and wine, and, sitting on the wall at the place where the lilies\r\ncrowded their ghost heads, she had looked out into the gulf of the\r\nnight, and it had suddenly seemed as if her life had been a noise all\r\nabout nothing.\r\n\r\nShe had been intensely surprised. She knew stars and darkness did\r\nproduce unusual emotions because, in others, she had seen them being\r\nproduced, but they had not before done it in herself. A noise all about\r\nnothing. Could she be quite well? She had wondered. For a long while\r\npast she had been aware that her life was a noise, but it had seemed to\r\nbe very much about something; a noise, indeed, about so much that she\r\nfelt she must get out of earshot for a little or she would be\r\ncompletely, and perhaps permanently, deafened. But suppose it was only\r\na noise about nothing?\r\n\r\nShe had not had a question like that in her mind before. It had made\r\nher feel lonely. She wanted to be alone, but not lonely. That was very\r\ndifferent; that was something that ached and hurt dreadfully right\r\ninside one. It was what one dreaded most. It was what made one go to so\r\nmany parties; and lately even the parties had seemed once or twice not\r\nto be a perfectly certain protection. Was it possible that loneliness\r\nhad nothing to do with circumstances, but only with the way one met\r\nthem? Perhaps, she had thought, she had better go to bed. She couldn’t\r\nbe very well.\r\n\r\nShe went to bed; and in the morning, after she had escaped the fly and\r\nhad her breakfast and got out again into the garden, there was this\r\nsame feeling again, and in broad daylight. Once more she had that\r\nreally rather disgusting suspicion that her life till now had not only\r\nbeen loud but empty. Well, if that were so, and if her first\r\ntwenty-eight years—the best ones—had gone just in meaningless noise,\r\nshe had better stop a moment and look round her; pause, as they said in\r\ntiresome novels, and consider. She hadn’t got many sets of twenty-eight\r\nyears. One more would see her growing very like Mrs. Fisher. Two more—\r\nShe averted her eyes.\r\n\r\nHer mother would have been concerned if she had known. Her mother\r\ndoted. Her father would have been concerned too, for he also doted.\r\nEverybody doted. And when, melodiously obstinate, she had insisted on\r\ngoing off to entomb herself in Italy for a whole month with queer\r\npeople she had got out of an advertisement, refusing even to take her\r\nmaid, the only explanation her friends could imagine was that poor\r\nScrap—such was her name among them—had overdone it and was feeling a\r\nlittle nervy.\r\n\r\nHer mother had been distressed at her departure. It was such an odd\r\nthing to do, such a sign of disappointment. She encouraged the general\r\nidea of the verge of a nervous breakdown. If she could have seen her\r\nadored Scrap, more delightful to look upon than any other mother’s\r\ndaughter had ever yet been, the object of her utmost pride, the source\r\nof all her fondest hopes, sitting staring at the empty noonday\r\nMediterranean considering her three possible sets of twenty-eight\r\nyears, she would have been miserable. To go away alone was bad; to\r\nthink was worse. No good could come out of the thinking of a beautiful\r\nyoung woman. Complications could come out of it in profusion, but no\r\ngood. The thinking of the beautiful was bound to result in hesitations,\r\nin reluctances, in unhappiness all round. And here, if she could have\r\nseen her, sat her Scrap thinking quite hard. And such things. Such old\r\nthings. Things nobody ever began to think till they were at least\r\nforty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\n\r\nThat one of the two sitting-rooms which Mrs. Fisher had taken for her\r\nown was a room of charm and character. She surveyed it with\r\nsatisfaction on going into it after breakfast, and was glad it was\r\nhers. It had a tiled floor, and walls the colour of pale honey, and\r\ninlaid furniture the colour of amber, and mellow books, many in ivory\r\nor lemon-coloured covers. There was a big window overlooking the sea\r\ntowards Genoa, and a glass door through which she could proceed out on\r\nto the battlements and walk along past the quaint and attractive\r\nwatch-tower, in itself a room with chairs and a writing table, to where\r\non the other side of the tower the battlements ended in a marble seat,\r\nand one could see the western bay and the point round which began the\r\nGulf of Spezia. Her south view, between these two stretches of sea, was\r\nanother hill, higher than San Salvatore, the last of the little\r\npeninsula, with the bland turrets of a smaller and uninhabited castle\r\non the top, on which the setting sun still shone when everything else\r\nwas sunk in shadow. Yes, she was very comfortably established here; and\r\nreceptacles—Mrs. Fisher did not examine their nature closely, but they\r\nseemed to be small stone troughs, or perhaps little sarcophagi—ringed\r\nround the battlements with flowers.\r\n\r\nThese battlements, she thought, considering them, would have been a\r\nperfect place for her to pace up and down gently in moments when she\r\nleast felt the need of her stick, or to sit in on the marble seat,\r\nhaving first put a cushion on it, if there had not unfortunately been a\r\nsecond glass door opening on to them, destroying their complete\r\nprivacy, spoiling her feeling that the place was only for her. The\r\nsecond door belonged to the round drawing-room, which both she and Lady\r\nCaroline had rejected as too dark. That room would probably be sat in\r\nby the women from Hampstead, and she was afraid they would not confine\r\nthemselves to sitting in it, but would come out through the glass door\r\nand invade her battlements. This would ruin the battlements. It would\r\nruin them as far as she was concerned if they were to be overrun; or\r\neven if, not actually overrun, they were liable to be raked by the eyes\r\nof persons inside the room. No one could be perfectly at ease if they\r\nwere being watched and knew it. What she wanted, what she surely had a\r\nright to, was privacy. She had no wish to intrude on the others; why\r\nthen should they intrude on her? And she could always relax her privacy\r\nif, when she became better acquainted with her companions, she should\r\nthink it worth while, but she doubted whether any of the three would so\r\ndevelop as to make her think it worth while.\r\n\r\nHardly anything was really worth while, reflected Mrs. Fisher, except\r\nthe past. It was astonishing, it was simply amazing, the superiority of\r\nthe past to the present. Those friends of hers in London, solid persons\r\nof her own age, knew the same past that she knew, could talk about it\r\nwith her, could compare it as she did with the tinkling present, and in\r\nremembering great men forget for a moment the trivial and barren young\r\npeople who still, in spite of the war, seemed to litter the world in\r\nsuch numbers. She had not come away from these friends, these\r\nconversable ripe friends, in order to spend her time in Italy chatting\r\nwith three persons of another generation and defective experience; she\r\nhad come away merely to avoid the treacheries of a London April. It was\r\ntrue what she had told the two who came to Prince of Wales Terrace,\r\nthat all she wished to do at San Salvatore was to sit by herself in the\r\nsun and remember. They knew this, for she had told them. It had been\r\nplainly expressed and clearly understood. Therefore she had a right to\r\nexpect them to stay inside the round drawing-room and not to emerge\r\ninterruptingly on to her battlements.\r\n\r\nBut would they? The doubt spoilt her morning. It was only towards\r\nlunch-time that she saw a way to be quite safe, and ringing for\r\nFrancesca, bade her, in slow and majestic Italian, shut the shutters of\r\nthe glass door of the round drawing-room, and then, going with her into\r\nthe room, which had become darker than ever in consequence, but also,\r\nMrs. Fisher observed to Francesca, who was being voluble, would because\r\nof this very darkness remain agreeably cool, and after all there were\r\nthe numerous slit-windows in the walls to let in light and it was\r\nnothing to do with her if they did not let it in, she directed the\r\nplacing of a cabinet of curios across the door on its inside.\r\n\r\nThis would discourage egress.\r\n\r\nThen she rang for Domenico, and caused him to move one of the\r\nflower-filled sarcophagi across the door on its outside.\r\n\r\nThis would discourage ingress.\r\n\r\n“No one,” said Domenico, hesitating, “will be able to use the door.”\r\n\r\n“No one,” said Mrs. Fisher firmly, “will wish to.”\r\n\r\nShe then retired to her sitting-room, and from a chair placed where she\r\ncould look straight on to them, gazed at her battlements, secured to\r\nher now completely, with calm pleasure.\r\n\r\nBeing here, she reflected placidly, was much cheaper than being in an\r\nhotel and, if she could keep off the others, immeasurably more\r\nagreeable. She was paying for her rooms—extremely pleasant rooms, now\r\nthat she was arranged in them—£3 a week, which came to about eight\r\nshillings a day, battlements, watch-tower and all. Where else abroad\r\ncould she live as well for so little, and have as many baths as she\r\nliked, for eight shillings a day? Of course she did not yet know what\r\nher food would cost, but she would insist on carefulness over that,\r\nthough she would also insist on its being carefulness combined with\r\nexcellence. The two were perfectly compatible if the caterer took\r\npains. The servants’ wages, she had ascertained, were negligible, owing\r\nto the advantageous exchange, so that there was only the food to cause\r\nher anxiety. If she saw signs of extravagance she would propose that\r\nthey each hand over a reasonable sum every week to Lady Caroline which\r\nshould cover the bills, any of it that was not used to be returned, and\r\nif it were exceeded the loss to be borne by the caterer.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher was well off and had the desire for comforts proper to her\r\nage, but she disliked expenses. So well off was she that, had she so\r\nchosen, she could have lived in an opulent part of London and driven\r\nfrom it and to it in a Rolls-Royce. She had no such wish. It needed\r\nmore vitality than went with true comfort to deal with a house in an\r\nopulent spot and a Rolls-Royce. Worries attended such possessions,\r\nworries of every kind, crowned by bills. In the sober gloom of Prince\r\nof Wales Terrace she could obscurely enjoy inexpensive yet real\r\ncomfort, without being snatched at by predatory men-servants or\r\ncollectors for charities, and a taxi stand was at the end of the road.\r\nHer annual outlay was small. The house was inherited. Death had\r\nfurnished it for her. She trod in the dining-room on the Turkey carpet\r\nof her fathers; she regulated her day by the excellent black marble\r\nclock on the mantelpiece which she remembered from childhood; her walls\r\nwere entirely covered by the photographs her illustrious deceased\r\nfriends had given either herself or her father, with their own\r\nhandwriting across the lower parts of their bodies, and the windows,\r\nshrouded by the maroon curtains of all her life, were decorated besides\r\nwith the selfsame aquariums to which she owed her first lessons in\r\nsealore, and in which still swam slowly the goldfishes of her youth.\r\n\r\nWere they the same goldfish? She did not know. Perhaps, like carp, they\r\noutlived everybody. Perhaps, on the other hand, behind the deep-sea\r\nvegetation provided for them at the bottom, they had from time to time\r\nas the years went by withdrawn and replaced themselves. Were they or\r\nwere they not, she sometimes wondered, contemplating them between the\r\ncourses of her solitary meals, the same goldfish that had that day been\r\nthere when Carlyle—how well she remembered it—angrily strode up to them\r\nin the middle of some argument with her father that had grown heated,\r\nand striking the glass smartly with his fist had put them to flight,\r\nshouting as they fled, “Och, ye deaf deevils! Och, ye lucky deaf\r\ndeevils! Ye can’t hear anything of the blasted, blethering, doddering,\r\nglaikit fool-stuff yer maister talks, can ye?” Or words to that effect.\r\n\r\nDear, great-souled Carlyle. Such natural gushings forth; such true\r\nfreshness; such real grandeur. Rugged, if you will—yes, undoubtedly\r\nsometimes rugged, and startling in a drawing-room, but magnificent. Who\r\nwas there now to put beside him? Who was there to mention in the same\r\nbreath? Her father, than whom no one had had more _flair_, said:\r\n“Thomas is immortal.” And here was this generation, this generation of\r\npuniness, raising its little voice in doubts, or, still worse, not\r\ngiving itself the trouble to raise it at all, not—it was incredible,\r\nbut it had been thus reported to her—even reading him. Mrs. Fisher did\r\nnot read him either, but that was different. She had read him; she had\r\ncertainly read him. Of course she had read him. There was\r\nTeufelsdröck—she quite well remembered a tailor called Teufelsdröck. So\r\nlike Carlyle to call him that. Yes, she must have read him, though\r\nnaturally details escaped her.\r\n\r\nThe gong sounded. Lost in reminiscence Mrs. Fisher had forgotten time,\r\nand hastened to her bedroom to wash her hands and smoothe her hair. She\r\ndid not wish to be late and set a bad example, and perhaps find her\r\nseat at the head of the table taken. One could put no trust in the\r\nmanners of the younger generation; especially not in those of that Mrs.\r\nWilkins.\r\n\r\nShe was, however, the first to arrive in the dining-room. Francesca in\r\na white apron stood ready with an enormous dish of smoking hot,\r\nglistening maccaroni, but nobody was there to eat it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher sat down, looking stern. Lax, lax.\r\n\r\n“Serve me,” she said to Francesca, who showed a disposition to wait for\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nFrancesca served her. Of the party she liked Mrs. Fisher least, in fact\r\nshe did not like her at all. She was the only one of the four ladies\r\nwho had not yet smiled. True she was old, true she was unbeautiful,\r\ntrue she therefore had no reason to smile, but kind ladies smiled,\r\nreason or no. They smiled, not because they were happy but because they\r\nwished to make happy. This one of the four ladies could not then,\r\nFrancesca decided, be kind; so she handed her the maccaroni, being\r\nunable to hide any of her feelings, morosely.\r\n\r\nIt was very well cooked, but Mrs. Fisher had never cared for maccaroni,\r\nespecially not this long, worm-shaped variety. She found it difficult\r\nto eat—slippery, wriggling off her fork, making her look, she felt,\r\nundignified when, having got it as she supposed into her mouth, ends of\r\nit yet hung out. Always, too, when she ate it she was reminded of Mr.\r\nFisher. He had during their married life behaved very much like\r\nmaccaroni. He had slipped, he had wriggled, he had made her feel\r\nundignified, and when at last she had got him safe, as she thought,\r\nthere had invariably been little bits of him that still, as it were,\r\nhung out.\r\n\r\nFrancesca from the sideboard watched Mrs. Fisher’s way with maccaroni\r\ngloomily, and her gloom deepened when she saw her at last take her\r\nknife to it and chop it small.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher really did not know how else to get hold of the stuff. She\r\nwas aware that knives in this connection were improper, but one did\r\nfinally lose patience. Maccaroni was never allowed to appear on her\r\ntable in London. Apart from its tiresomeness she did not even like it,\r\nand she would tell Lady Caroline not to order it again. Years of\r\npractice, reflected Mrs. Fisher, chopping it up, years of actual living\r\nin Italy, would be necessary to learn the exact trick. Browning managed\r\nmaccaroni wonderfully. She remembered watching him one day when he came\r\nto lunch with her father, and a dish of it had been ordered as a\r\ncompliment to his connection with Italy. Fascinating, the way it went\r\nin. No chasing round the plate, no slidings off the fork, no subsequent\r\nprotrusions of loose ends—just one dig, one whisk, one thrust, one\r\ngulp, and lo, yet another poet had been nourished.\r\n\r\n“Shall I go and seek the young lady?” asked Francesca, unable any\r\nlonger to look on a good maccaroni being cut with a knife.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher came out of her reminiscent reflections with difficulty.\r\n“She knows lunch is at half-past twelve,” she said. “They all know.”\r\n\r\n“She may be asleep,” said Francesca. “The other ladies are further\r\naway, but this one is not far away.”\r\n\r\n“Beat the gong again then,” said Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\nWhat manners, she thought; what, what manners. It was not an hotel, and\r\nconsiderations were due. She must say she was surprised at Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, who had not looked like somebody unpunctual. Lady Caroline,\r\ntoo—she had seemed amiable and courteous, whatever else she might be.\r\nFrom the other one, of course, she expected nothing.\r\n\r\nFrancesca fetched the gong, and took it out into the garden and\r\nadvanced, beating it as she advanced, close up to Lady Caroline, who,\r\nstill stretched in her low chair, waited till she had done, and then\r\nturned her head and in the sweetest tones poured forth what appeared to\r\nbe music but was really invective.\r\n\r\nFrancesca did not recognise the liquid flow as invective; how was she\r\nto, when it came out sounding like that? And with her face all smiles,\r\nfor she could not but smile when she looked at this young lady, she\r\ntold her the maccaroni was getting cold.\r\n\r\n“When I do not come to meals it is because I do not wish to come to\r\nmeals,” said the irritated Scrap, “and you will not in future disturb\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Is she ill?” asked Francesca, sympathetic but unable to stop smiling.\r\nNever, never had she seen hair so beautiful. Like pure flax; like the\r\nhair of northern babes. On such a little head only blessing could rest,\r\non such a little head the nimbus of the holiest saints could fitly be\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nScrap shut her eyes and refused to answer. In this she was injudicious,\r\nfor its effect was to convince Francesca, who hurried away full of\r\nconcern to tell Mrs. Fisher, that she was indisposed. And Mrs. Fisher,\r\nbeing prevented, she explained, from going out to Lady Caroline herself\r\nbecause of her stick, sent the two others instead, who had come in at\r\nthat moment heated and breathless and full of excuses, while she\r\nherself proceeded to the next course, which was a very well-made\r\nomelette, bursting most agreeably at both its ends with young green\r\npeas.\r\n\r\n“Serve me,” she directed Francesca, who again showed a disposition to\r\nwait for the others.\r\n\r\n“_Oh_, why won’t they leave me alone?—oh, why _won’t_ they leave me\r\nalone?” Scrap asked herself when she heard more scrunchings on the\r\nlittle pebbles which took the place of grass, and therefore knew some\r\none else was approaching.\r\n\r\nShe kept her eyes tight shut this time. Why should she go in to lunch\r\nif she didn’t want to? This wasn’t a private house; she was in no way\r\ntangled up in duties towards a tiresome hostess. For all practical\r\npurposes San Salvatore was an hotel, and she ought to be let alone to\r\neat or not to eat exactly as if she really had been in an hotel.\r\n\r\nBut the unfortunate Scrap could not just sit still and close her eyes\r\nwithout rousing that desire to stroke and pet in her beholders with\r\nwhich she was only too familiar. Even the cook had patted her. And now\r\na gentle hand—how well she knew and how much she dreaded gentle\r\nhands—was placed on her forehead.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you’re not well,” said a voice that was not Mrs. Fisher’s,\r\nand therefore must belong to one of the originals.\r\n\r\n“I have a headache,” murmured Scrap. Perhaps it was best to say that;\r\nperhaps it was the shortest cut to peace.\r\n\r\n“I’m so sorry,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot softly, for it was her hand being\r\ngentle.\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Scrap to herself, “who thought if I came here I would\r\nescape mothers.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think some tea would do you good?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot\r\ntenderly.\r\n\r\nTea? The idea was abhorrent to Scrap. In this heat to be drinking tea\r\nin the middle of the day. . .\r\n\r\n“No,” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“I expect what would really be best for her,” said another voice, “is\r\nto be left quiet.”\r\n\r\nHow sensible, thought Scrap; and raised the eye-lashes of one eye just\r\nenough to peep through and see who was speaking.\r\n\r\nIt was the freckled original. The dark one, then, was the one with the\r\nhand. The freckled one rose in her esteem.\r\n\r\n“But I can’t bear to think of you with a headache and nothing being\r\ndone for it,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. “Would a cup of strong black\r\ncoffee—?”\r\n\r\nScrap said no more. She waited, motionless and dumb, till Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot should remove her hand. After all, she couldn’t stand there\r\nall day, and when she went away she would have to take her hand with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“I do think,” said the freckled one, “that she wants nothing except\r\nquiet.”\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps the freckled one pulled the one with the hand by the\r\nsleeve, for the hold on Scrap’s forehead relaxed, and after a minute’s\r\nsilence, during which no doubt she was being contemplated—she was\r\nalways being contemplated—the footsteps began to scrunch the pebbles\r\nagain, and grew fainter, and were gone.\r\n\r\n“Lady Caroline has a headache,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, re-entering the\r\ndining-room and sitting down in her place next to Mrs. Fisher. “I can’t\r\npersuade her to have even a little tea, or some black coffee. Do you\r\nknow what aspirin is in Italian?”\r\n\r\n“The proper remedy for headaches,” said Mrs. Fisher firmly, “is castor\r\noil.”\r\n\r\n“But she hasn’t got a headache,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Carlyle,” said Mrs. Fisher, who had finished her omelette and had\r\nleisure, while she waited for the next course, to talk, “suffered at\r\none period terribly from headaches, and he constantly took castor oil\r\nas a remedy. He took it, I should say, almost to excess, and called it,\r\nI remember, in his interesting way the oil of sorrow. My father said it\r\ncoloured for a time his whole attitude to life, his whole philosophy.\r\nBut that was because he took too much. What Lady Caroline wants is one\r\ndose, and one only. It is a mistake to keep on taking castor oil.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know the Italian for it?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“Ah, that I’m afraid I don’t. However, she would know. You can ask\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“But she hasn’t got a headache,” repeated Mrs. Wilkins, who was\r\nstruggling with the maccaroni. “She only wants to be let alone.”\r\n\r\nThey both looked at her. The word shovel crossed Mrs. Fisher’s mind in\r\nconnection with Mrs. Wilkins’s actions at that moment.\r\n\r\n“Then why should she say she has?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“Because she is still trying to be polite. Soon she won’t try, when the\r\nplace has got more into her—she’ll really be it. Without trying.\r\nNaturally.”\r\n\r\n“Lotty, you see,” explained Mrs. Arbuthnot, smiling to Mrs. Fisher, who\r\nsat waiting with a stony patience for her next course, delayed because\r\nMrs. Wilkins would go on trying to eat the maccaroni, which must be\r\nless worth eating than ever now that it was cold; “Lotty, you see, has\r\na theory about this place—”\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Fisher had no wish to hear any theory of Mrs. Wilkins’s.\r\n\r\n“I am sure I don’t know,” she interrupted, looking severely at Mrs.\r\nWilkins, “why you should assume Lady Caroline is not telling the\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t assume—I know,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“And pray how do you know?” asked Mrs. Fisher icily, for Mrs. Wilkins\r\nwas actually helping herself to more maccaroni, offered her officiously\r\nand unnecessarily a second time by Francesca.\r\n\r\n“When I was out there just now I saw inside her.”\r\n\r\nWell, Mrs. Fisher wasn’t going to say anything to that; she wasn’t\r\ngoing to trouble to reply to downright idiocy. Instead she sharply\r\nrapped the little table-gong by her side, though there was Francesca\r\nstanding at the sideboard, and said, for she would wait no longer for\r\nher next course, “Serve me.”\r\n\r\nAnd Francesca—it must have been wilful—offered her the maccaroni again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no way of getting into or out of the top garden at San\r\nSalvatore except through the two glass doors, unfortunately side by\r\nside, of the dining-room and the hall. A person in the garden who\r\nwished to escape unseen could not, for the person to be escaped from\r\nwould be met on the way. It was a small, oblong garden, and concealment\r\nwas impossible. What trees there were—the Judas tree, the tamarisk, the\r\numbrella-pine—grew close to the low parapets. Rose bushes gave no real\r\ncover; one step to right or left of them, and the person wishing to be\r\nprivate was discovered. Only the north-west corner was a little place\r\njutting out from the great wall, a kind of excrescence or loop, no\r\ndoubt used in the old distrustful days for observation, where it was\r\npossible to sit really unseen, because between it and the house was a\r\nthick clump of daphne.\r\n\r\nScrap, after glancing round to see that no one was looking, got up and\r\ncarried her chair into this place, stealing away as carefully on tiptoe\r\nas those steal whose purpose is sin. There was another excrescence on\r\nthe walls just like it at the north-east corner, but this, though the\r\nview from it was almost more beautiful, for from it you could see the\r\nbay and the lovely mountains behind Mezzago, was exposed. No bushes\r\ngrew near it, nor had it any shade. The north-west loop then was where\r\nshe would sit, and she settled into it, and nestling her head in her\r\ncushion and putting her feet comfortably on the parapet, from whence\r\nthey appeared to the villagers on the piazza below as two white doves,\r\nthought that now indeed she would be safe.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher found her there, guided by the smell of her cigarette. The\r\nincautious Scrap had not thought of that. Mrs. Fisher did not smoke\r\nherself, and all the more distinctly could she smell the smoke of\r\nothers. The virile smell met her directly she went out into the garden\r\nfrom the dining-room after lunch in order to have her coffee. She had\r\nbidden Francesca set the coffee in the shade of the house just outside\r\nthe glass door, and when Mrs. Wilkins, seeing a table being carried\r\nthere, reminded her, very officiously and tactlessly Mrs. Fisher\r\nconsidered, that Lady Caroline wanted to be alone, she retorted—and\r\nwith what propriety—that the garden was for everybody.\r\n\r\nInto it accordingly she went, and was immediately aware that Lady\r\nCaroline was smoking. She said to herself, “These modern young women,”\r\nand proceeded to find her; her stick, now that lunch was over, being no\r\nlonger the hindrance to action that it was before her meal had been\r\nsecurely, as Browning once said—surely it was Browning? Yes, she\r\nremembered how much diverted she had been—roped in.\r\n\r\nNobody diverted her now, reflected Mrs. Fisher, making straight for the\r\nclump of daphne; the world had grown very dull, and had entirely lost\r\nits sense of humour. Probably they still had their jokes, these\r\npeople—in fact she knew they did, for _Punch_ still went on; but how\r\ndifferently it went on, and what jokes. Thackeray, in his inimitable\r\nway, would have made mincemeat of this generation. Of how much it\r\nneeded the tonic properties of that astringent pen it was of course\r\nunaware. It no longer even held him—at least, so she had been\r\ninformed—in any particular esteem. Well, she could not give it eyes to\r\nsee and ears to hear and a heart to understand, but she could and would\r\ngive it, represented and united in the form of Lady Caroline, a good\r\ndose of honest medicine.\r\n\r\n“I hear you are not well,” she said, standing in the narrow entrance of\r\nthe loop and looking down with the inflexible face of one who is\r\ndetermined to do good at the motionless and apparently sleeping Scrap.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher had a deep voice, very like a man’s, for she had been\r\novertaken by that strange masculinity that sometimes pursues a woman\r\nduring the last laps of her life.\r\n\r\nScrap tried to pretend that she was asleep, but if she had been her\r\ncigarette would not have been held in her fingers but would have been\r\nlying on the ground.\r\n\r\nShe forgot this. Mrs. Fisher did not, and coming inside the loop, sat\r\ndown on a narrow stone seat built out of the wall. For a little she\r\ncould sit on it; for a little, till the chill began to penetrate.\r\n\r\nShe contemplated the figure before her. Undoubtedly a pretty creature,\r\nand one that would have had a success at Farringford. Strange how\r\neasily even the greatest men were moved by exteriors. She had seen with\r\nher own eyes Tennyson turn away from everybody—turn, positively, his\r\nback on a crowd of eminent people assembled to do him honour, and\r\nwithdraw to the window with a young person nobody had ever heard of,\r\nwho had been brought there by accident and whose one and only merit—if\r\nit be a merit, that which is conferred by chance—was beauty. Beauty!\r\nAll over before you can turn round. An affair, one might almost say, of\r\nminutes. Well, while it lasted it did seem able to do what it liked\r\nwith men. Even husbands were not immune. There had been passages in the\r\nlife of Mr. Fisher . . .\r\n\r\n“I expect the journey has upset you,” she said in her deep voice. “What\r\nyou want is a good dose of some simple medicine. I shall ask Domenico\r\nif there is such a thing in the village as castor oil.”\r\n\r\nScrap opened her eyes and looked straight at Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Mrs. Fisher, “I knew you were not asleep. If you had been\r\nyou would have let your cigarette fall to the ground.”\r\n\r\nScrap threw the cigarette over the parapet.\r\n\r\n“Waste,” said Mrs. Fisher. “I don’t like smoking for women, but I still\r\nless like waste.”\r\n\r\n“What _does_ one do with people like this?” Scrap asked herself, her\r\neyes fixed on Mrs. Fisher in what felt to her an indignant stare but\r\nappeared to Mrs. Fisher as really charming docility.\r\n\r\n“Now you’ll take my advice,” said Mrs. Fisher, touched, “and not\r\nneglect what may very well turn into an illness. We are in Italy, you\r\nknow, and one has to be careful. You ought, to begin with, to go to\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\n“I never go to bed,” snapped Scrap; and it sounded as moving, as\r\nforlorn, as that line spoken years and years ago by an actress playing\r\nthe part of Poor Jo in dramatised version of Bleak House—“I’m always\r\nmoving on,” said Poor Jo in this play, urged to do so by a policeman;\r\nand Mrs. Fisher, then a girl, had laid her head on the red velvet\r\nparapet of the front row of the dress circle and wept aloud.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful, Scrap’s voice. It had given her, in the ten years\r\nsince she came out, all the triumphs that intelligence and wit can\r\nhave, because it made whatever she said seem memorable. She ought, with\r\na throat formation like that, to have been a singer, but in every kind\r\nof music Scrap was dumb except this one music of the speaking voice;\r\nand what a fascination, what a spell lay in that. Such was the\r\nloveliness of her face and the beauty of her colouring that there was\r\nnot a man into whose eyes at the sight of her there did not leap a\r\nflame of intensest interest; but, when he heard her voice, the flame in\r\nthat man’s eyes was caught and fixed. It was the same with every man,\r\neducated and uneducated, old, young, desirable themselves or\r\nundesirable, men of her own world and bus-conductors, generals and\r\nTommies—during the war she had had a perplexing time—bishops equally\r\nwith vergers—round about her confirmation startling occurrences had\r\ntaken place—wholesome and unwholesome, rich and penniless, brilliant or\r\nidiotic; and it made no difference at all what they were, or how long\r\nand securely married: into the eyes of every one of them, when they saw\r\nher, leapt this flame, and when they heard her it stayed there.\r\n\r\nScrap had had enough of this look. It only led to difficulties. At\r\nfirst it had delighted her. She had been excited, triumphant. To be\r\napparently incapable of doing or saying the wrong thing, to be\r\napplauded, listened to, petted, adored wherever she went, and when she\r\ncame home to find nothing there either but the most indulgent proud\r\nfondness—why, how extremely pleasant. And so easy, too. No preparation\r\nnecessary for this achievement, no hard work, nothing to learn. She\r\nneed take no trouble. She had only to appear, and presently say\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nBut gradually experiences gathered round her. After all, she had to\r\ntake trouble, she had to make efforts, because, she discovered with\r\nastonishment and rage, she had to defend herself. That look, that\r\nleaping look, meant that she was going to be grabbed at. Some of those\r\nwho had it were more humble than others, especially if they were young,\r\nbut they all, according to their several ability, grabbed; and she who\r\nhad entered the world so jauntily, with her head in the air and the\r\ncompletest confidence in anybody whose hair was grey, began to\r\ndistrust, and then to dislike, and soon to shrink away from, and\r\npresently to be indignant. Sometimes it was just as if she didn’t\r\nbelong to herself, wasn’t her own at all, but was regarded as a\r\nuniversal thing, a sort of beauty-of-all-work. Really men . . . And she\r\nfound herself involved in queer, vague quarrels, being curiously hated.\r\nReally women . . . And when the war came, and she flung herself into it\r\nalong with everybody else, it finished her. Really generals . . .\r\n\r\nThe war finished Scrap. It killed the one man she felt safe with, whom\r\nshe would have married, and it finally disgusted her with love. Since\r\nthen she had been embittered. She was struggling as angrily in the\r\nsweet stuff of life as a wasp got caught in honey. Just as desperately\r\ndid she try to unstick her wings. It gave her no pleasure to outdo\r\nother women; she didn’t want their tiresome men. What could one do with\r\nmen when one had got them? None of them would talk to her of anything\r\nbut the things of love, and how foolish and fatiguing that became after\r\na bit. It was as though a healthy person with a normal hunger was given\r\nnothing whatever to eat but sugar. Love, love . . . the very word made\r\nher want to slap somebody. “_Why_ should I love you? _Why_ should I?”\r\nshe would ask amazed sometimes when somebody was trying—somebody was\r\nalways trying—to propose to her. But she never got a real answer, only\r\nfurther incoherence.\r\n\r\nA deep cynicism took hold of the unhappy Scrap. Her inside grew\r\nhoary with disillusionment, while her gracious and charming outside\r\ncontinued to make the world more beautiful. What had the future in it\r\nfor her? She would not be able, after such a preparation, to take hold\r\nof it. She was fit for nothing; she had wasted all this time being\r\nbeautiful. Presently she wouldn’t be beautiful, and what then? Scrap\r\ndidn’t know what then, it appalled her to wonder even. Tired as she\r\nwas of being conspicuous she was at least used to that, she had never\r\nknown anything else; and to become inconspicuous, to fade, to grow\r\nshabby and dim, would probably be most painful. And once she began,\r\nwhat years and years of it there would be! Imagine, thought Scrap,\r\nhaving most of one’s life at the wrong end. Imagine being old for two\r\nor three times as long as being young. Stupid, stupid. Everything was\r\nstupid. There wasn’t a thing she wanted to do. There were thousands\r\nof things she didn’t want to do. Avoidance, silence, invisibility, if\r\npossible unconsciousness—these negations were all she asked for at the\r\nmoment; and here, even here, she was not allowed a minute’s peace, and\r\nthis absurd woman must come pretending, merely because she wanted to\r\nexercise power and make her go to bed and make her—hideous—drink castor\r\noil, that she thought she was ill.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure,” said Mrs. Fisher, who felt the cold of the stone beginning\r\nto come through and knew she could not sit much longer, “you’ll do what\r\nis reasonable. Your mother would wish—have you a mother?”\r\n\r\nA faint wonder came into Scrap’s eyes. Have you a mother? If ever\r\nanybody had a mother it was Scrap. It had not occurred to her that\r\nthere could be people who had never heard of her mother. She was one of\r\nthe major marchionesses—there being, as no one knew better than Scrap,\r\nmarchionesses and marchionesses—and had held high positions at Court.\r\nHer father, too, in his day had been most prominent. His day was a\r\nlittle over, poor dear, because in the war he had made some important\r\nmistakes, and besides he was now grown old; still, there he was, an\r\nexcessively well-known person. How restful, how extraordinarily restful\r\nto have found some one who had never heard of any of her lot, or at\r\nleast had not yet connected her with them.\r\n\r\nShe began to like Mrs. Fisher. Perhaps the originals didn’t know\r\nanything about her either. When she first wrote to them and signed her\r\nname, that great name of Dester which twisted in and out of English\r\nhistory like a bloody thread, for its bearers constantly killed, she\r\nhad taken it for granted that they would know who she was; and at the\r\ninterview in Shaftesbury Avenue she was sure they did know, because\r\nthey hadn’t asked, as they otherwise would have, for references.\r\n\r\nScrap began to cheer up. If nobody at San Salvatore had ever heard of\r\nher, if for a whole month she could shed herself, get right away from\r\neverything connected with herself, be allowed really to forget the\r\nclinging and the clogging and all the noise, why, perhaps she might\r\nmake something of herself after all. She might really think; really\r\nclear up her mind; really come to some conclusion.\r\n\r\n“What I want to do here,” she said, leaning forward in her chair and\r\nclasping her hands round her knees and looking up at Mrs. Fisher, whose\r\nseat was higher than hers, almost with animation, so much pleased was\r\nshe that Mrs. Fisher knew nothing about her, “is to come to a\r\nconclusion. That’s all. It isn’t much to want, is it? Just that.”\r\n\r\nShe gazed at Mrs. Fisher, and thought that almost any conclusion would\r\ndo; the great thing was to get hold of something, catch something\r\ntight, cease to drift.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher’s little eyes surveyed her. “I should say,” she said, “that\r\nwhat a young woman like you wants is a husband and children.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s one of the things I’m going to consider,” said Scrap\r\namiably. “But I don’t think it would be a conclusion.”\r\n\r\n“And meanwhile,” said Mrs. Fisher, getting up, for the cold of the\r\nstone was now through, “I shouldn’t trouble my head if I were you with\r\nconsiderings and conclusions. Women’s heads weren’t made for thinking,\r\nI assure you. I should go to bed and get well.”\r\n\r\n“I am well,” said Scrap.\r\n\r\n“Then why did you send a message that you were ill?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ve had all the trouble of coming out here for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“But wouldn’t you prefer coming out and finding me well than coming out\r\nand finding me ill?” asked Scrap, smiling.\r\n\r\nEven Mrs. Fisher was caught by the smile.\r\n\r\n“Well, you’re a pretty creature,” she said forgivingly. “It’s a pity\r\nyou weren’t born fifty years ago. My friends would have liked looking\r\nat you.”\r\n\r\n“I’m very glad I wasn’t,” said Scrap. “I dislike being looked at.”\r\n\r\n“Absurd,” said Mrs. Fisher, growing stern again. “That’s what you are\r\nmade for, young women like you. For what else, pray? And I assure you\r\nthat if my friends had looked at you, you would have been looked at by\r\nsome very great people.”\r\n\r\n“I dislike very great people,” said Scrap, frowning. There had been an\r\nincident quite recently—really potentates. . .\r\n\r\n“What _I_ dislike,” said Mrs. Fisher, now as cold as the stone she had\r\ngot up from, “is the pose of the modern young woman. It seems to me\r\npitiful, positively pitiful, in its silliness.”\r\n\r\nAnd, her stick crunching the pebbles, she walked away.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” Scrap said to herself, dropping back into her\r\ncomfortable position with her head in the cushion and her feet on the\r\nparapet; if only people would go away she didn’t in the least mind why\r\nthey went.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think darling Scrap is growing a little, just a little,\r\npeculiar?” her mother had asked her father a short time before that\r\nlatest peculiarity of the flight to San Salvatore, uncomfortably struck\r\nby the very odd things Scrap said and the way she had taken to slinking\r\nout of reach whenever she could and avoiding everybody except—such a\r\nsign of age—quite young men, almost boys.\r\n\r\n“Eh? What? Peculiar? Well, let her be peculiar if she likes. A woman\r\nwith her looks can be any damned thing she pleases,” was the infatuated\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n“I do let her,” said her mother meekly; and indeed if she did not, what\r\ndifference would it make?\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher was sorry she had bothered about Lady Caroline. She went\r\nalong the hall towards her private sitting-room, and her stick as she\r\nwent struck the stone floor with a vigour in harmony with her feelings.\r\nSheer silliness, these poses. She had no patience with them. Unable to\r\nbe or do anything of themselves, the young of the present generation\r\ntried to achieve a reputation for cleverness by decrying all that was\r\nobviously great and obviously good and by praising everything, however\r\nobviously bad, that was different. Apes, thought Mrs. Fisher, roused.\r\nApes. Apes. And in her sitting-room she found more apes, or what seemed\r\nto her in her present mood more, for there was Mrs. Arbuthnot placidly\r\ndrinking coffee, while at the writing-table, the writing-table she\r\nalready looked upon as sacred, using her pen, her own pen brought for\r\nher hand alone from Prince of Wales Terrace, sat Mrs. Wilkins writing;\r\nat the table; in her room; with her pen.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t this a delightful place?” said Mrs. Arbuthnot cordially. “We\r\nhave just discovered it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m writing to Mellersh,” said Mrs. Wilkins, turning her head and also\r\ncordially—as though, Mrs. Fisher thought, she cared a straw who she was\r\nwriting to and anyhow knew who the person she called Mellersh was.\r\n“He’ll want to know,” said Mrs. Wilkins, optimism induced by her\r\nsurroundings, “that I’ve got here safely.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sweet smells that were everywhere in San Salvatore were alone\r\nenough to produce concord. They came into the sitting-room from the\r\nflowers on the battlements, and met the ones from the flowers inside\r\nthe room, and almost, thought Mrs. Wilkins, could be seen greeting each\r\nother with a holy kiss. Who could be angry in the middle of such\r\ngentlenesses? Who could be acquisitive, selfish, in the old rasped\r\nLondon way, in the presence of this bounteous beauty?\r\n\r\nYet Mrs. Fisher seemed to be all three of these things.\r\n\r\nThere was so much beauty, so much more than enough for every one, that\r\nit did appear to be a vain activity to try and make a corner in it.\r\n\r\nYet Mrs. Fisher was trying to make a corner in it, and had railed off a\r\nportion for her exclusive use.\r\n\r\nWell, she would get over that presently; she would get over it\r\ninevitably, Mrs. Wilkins was sure, after a day or two in the\r\nextraordinary atmosphere of peace in that place.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile she obviously hadn’t even begun to get over it. She stood\r\nlooking at her and Rose with an expression that appeared to be one of\r\nanger. Anger. Fancy. Silly old nerve-racked London feelings, thought\r\nMrs. Wilkins, whose eyes saw the room full of kisses, and everybody in\r\nit being kissed, Mrs. Fisher as copiously as she herself and Rose.\r\n\r\n“You don’t like us being in here,” said Mrs. Wilkins, getting up and at\r\nonce, after her manner, fixing on the truth. “Why?”\r\n\r\n“I should have thought,” said Mrs. Fisher leaning on her stick, “you\r\ncould have seen that it is my room.”\r\n\r\n“You mean because of the photographs,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot, who was a little red and surprised, got up too.\r\n\r\n“And the notepaper,” said Mrs. Fisher. “Notepaper with my London\r\naddress on it. That pen—”\r\n\r\nShe pointed. It was still in Mrs. Wilkins’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Is yours. I’m very sorry,” said Mrs. Wilkins, laying it on the table.\r\nAnd she added smiling, that it had just been writing some very amiable\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“But why,” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, who found herself unable to acquiesce\r\nin Mrs. Fisher’s arrangements without at least a gentle struggle,\r\n“ought we not to be here? It’s a sitting-room.”\r\n\r\n“There is another one,” said Mrs. Fisher. “You and your friend cannot\r\nsit in two rooms at once, and if I have no wish to disturb you in yours\r\nI am unable to see why you should wish to disturb me in mine.”\r\n\r\n“But why—” began Mrs. Arbuthnot again.\r\n\r\n“It’s quite natural,” Mrs. Wilkins interrupted, for Rose was looking\r\nstubborn; and turning to Mrs. Fisher she said that although sharing\r\nthings with friends was pleasant she could understand that Mrs. Fisher,\r\nstill steeped in the Prince of Wales Terrace attitude to life, did not\r\nyet want to, but that she would get rid of that after a bit and feel\r\nquite different. “Soon you’ll want us to share,” said Mrs. Wilkins\r\nreassuringly. “Why, you may even get so far as _asking_ me to use your\r\npen if you knew I hadn’t got one.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher was moved almost beyond control by this speech. To have a\r\nramshackle young woman from Hampstead patting her on the back as it\r\nwere, in breezy certitude that quite soon she would improve, stirred\r\nher more deeply than anything had stirred her since her first discovery\r\nthat Mr. Fisher was not what he seemed. Mrs. Wilkins must certainly be\r\ncurbed. But how? There was a curious imperviousness about her. At that\r\nmoment, for instance, she was smiling as pleasantly and with as\r\nunclouded a face as if she were saying nothing in the least\r\nimpertinent. Would she know she was being curbed? If she didn’t know,\r\nif she were too tough to feel it, then what? Nothing, except avoidance;\r\nexcept, precisely, one’s own private sitting-room.\r\n\r\n“I’m an old woman,” said Mrs. Fisher, “and I need a room to myself. I\r\ncannot get about, because of my stick. As I cannot get about I have to\r\nsit. Why should I not sit quietly and undisturbed, as I told you in\r\nLondon I intended to? If people are to come in and out all day long,\r\nchattering and leaving doors open, you will have broken the agreement,\r\nwhich was that I was to be quiet.”\r\n\r\n“But we haven’t the least wish—” began Mrs. Arbuthnot, who was again\r\ncut short by Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“We’re only too glad,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “for you to have this room if\r\nit makes you happy. We didn’t know about it, that’s all. We wouldn’t\r\nhave come in if we had—not till you invited us, anyhow. I expect,” she\r\nfinished looking down cheerfully at Mrs. Fisher, “you soon will.” And\r\npicking up her letter she took Mrs. Arbuthnot’s hand and drew her\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot did not want to go. She, the mildest of women, was\r\nfilled with a curious and surely unchristian desire to stay and fight.\r\nNot, of course, really, nor even with any definitely aggressive words.\r\nNo; she only wanted to reason with Mrs. Fisher, and to reason\r\npatiently. But she did feel that something ought to be said, and that\r\nshe ought not to allow herself to be rated and turned out as if she\r\nwere a schoolgirl caught in ill behaviour by Authority.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins, however, drew her firmly to and through the door, and\r\nonce again Rose wondered at Lotty, at her balance, her sweet and\r\nequable temper—she who in England had been such a thing of gusts. From\r\nthe moment they got into Italy it was Lotty who seemed the elder. She\r\ncertainly was very happy; blissful, in fact. Did happiness so\r\ncompletely protect one? Did it make one so untouchable, so wise? Rose\r\nwas happy herself, but not anything like _so_ happy. Evidently not, for\r\nnot only did she want to fight Mrs. Fisher but she wanted something\r\nelse, something more than this lovely place, something to complete it;\r\nshe wanted Frederick. For the first time in her life she was surrounded\r\nby perfect beauty, and her one thought was to show it to him, to share\r\nit with him. She wanted Frederick. She yearned for Frederick. Ah, if\r\nonly, only Frederick . . .\r\n\r\n“Poor old thing,” said Mrs. Wilkins, shutting the door gently on Mrs.\r\nFisher and her triumph. “Fancy on a day like this.”\r\n\r\n“She’s a very rude old thing,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“She’ll get over that. I’m sorry we chose just her room to go and sit\r\nin.”\r\n\r\n“It’s much the nicest,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. “And it isn’t hers.”\r\n\r\n“Oh but there are lots of other places, and she’s such a poor old\r\nthing. Let her have the room. Whatever does it matter?”\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Wilkins said she was going down to the village to find out\r\nwhere the post-office was and post her letter to Mellersh, and would\r\nRose go too.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been thinking about Mellersh,” said Mrs. Wilkins as they walked,\r\none behind the other, down the narrow zigzag path up which they had\r\nclimbed in the rain the night before.\r\n\r\nShe went first. Mrs. Arbuthnot, quite naturally now, followed. In\r\nEngland it had been the other way about—Lotty, timid, hesitating,\r\nexcept when she burst out so awkwardly, getting behind the calm and\r\nreasonable Rose whenever she could.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been thinking about Mellersh,” repeated Mrs. Wilkins over her\r\nshoulder, as Rose seemed not to have heard.\r\n\r\n“Have you?” said Rose, a faint distaste in her voice, for her\r\nexperiences with Mellersh had not been of a kind to make her enjoy\r\nremembering him. She had deceived Mellersh; therefore she didn’t like\r\nhim. She was unconscious that this was the reason of her dislike, and\r\nthought it was that there didn’t seem to be much, if any, of the grace\r\nof God about him. And yet how wrong to feel that, she rebuked herself,\r\nand how presumptuous. No doubt Lotty’s husband was far, far nearer to\r\nGod than she herself was ever likely to be. Still, she didn’t like him.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been a mean dog,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“A what?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, incredulous of her hearing.\r\n\r\n“All this coming away and leaving him in that dreary place while I\r\nrollick in heaven. He had planned to take me to Italy for Easter\r\nhimself. Did I tell you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot; and indeed she had discouraged talk about\r\nhusbands. Whenever Lotty had begun to blurt out things she had swiftly\r\nchanged the conversation. One husband led to another, in conversation\r\nas well as in life, she felt, and she could not, she would not, talk of\r\nFrederick. Beyond the bare fact that he was there, he had not been\r\nmentioned. Mellersh had had to be mentioned, because of his\r\nobstructiveness, but she had carefully kept him from overflowing\r\noutside the limits of necessity.\r\n\r\n“Well, he did,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “He had never done such a thing in\r\nhis life before, and I was horrified. Fancy—just as I had planned to\r\ncome to it myself.”\r\n\r\nShe paused on the path and looked up at Rose.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Rose, trying to think of something else to talk about.\r\n\r\n“Now you see why I say I’ve been a mean dog. _He_ had planned a holiday\r\nin Italy with me, and _I_ had planned a holiday in Italy leaving him at\r\nhome. I think,” she went on, her eyes fixed on Rose’s face, “Mellersh\r\nhas every reason to be both angry and hurt.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot was astonished. The extraordinary quickness with which,\r\nhour by hour, under her very eyes, Lotty became more selfless,\r\ndisconcerted her. She was turning into something surprisingly like a\r\nsaint. Here she was now being affectionate about Mellersh—Mellersh, who\r\nonly that morning, while they hung their feet into the sea, had seemed\r\na mere iridescence, Lotty had told her, a thing of gauze. That was only\r\nthat morning; and by the time they had had lunch Lotty had developed so\r\nfar as to have got him solid enough again to write to, and to write to\r\nat length. And now, a few minutes later, she was announcing that he had\r\nevery reason to be angry with her and hurt, and that she herself had\r\nbeen—the language was unusual, but it did express real penitence—a mean\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nRose stared at her astonished. If she went on like this, soon a nimbus\r\nmight be expected round her head, was there already, if one didn’t know\r\nit was the sun through the tree-trunks catching her sandy hair.\r\n\r\nA great desire to love and be friends, to love everybody, to be friends\r\nwith everybody, seemed to be invading Lotty—a desire for sheer\r\ngoodness. Rose’s own experience was that goodness, the state of being\r\ngood, was only reached with difficulty and pain. It took a long time to\r\nget to it; in fact one never did get to it, or, if for a flashing\r\ninstant one did, it was only for a flashing instant. Desperate\r\nperseverance was needed to struggle along its path, and all the way was\r\ndotted with doubts. Lotty simply flew along. She had certainly, thought\r\nRose, not got rid of her impetuousness. It had merely taken another\r\ndirection. She was now impetuously becoming a saint. Could one really\r\nattain goodness so violently? Wouldn’t there be an equally violent\r\nreaction?\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t,” said Rose with caution, looking down into Lotty’s bright\r\neyes—the path was steep, so that Lotty was well below her—“I shouldn’t\r\nbe sure of that too quickly.”\r\n\r\n“But I am sure of it, and I’ve written and told him so.”\r\n\r\nRose stared. “Why, but only this morning—” she began.\r\n\r\n“It’s all in this,” interrupted Lotty, tapping the envelope and looking\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n“What—everything?”\r\n\r\n“You mean about the advertisement and my savings being spent? Oh no—not\r\nyet. But I’ll tell him all that when he comes.”\r\n\r\n“When he comes?” repeated Rose.\r\n\r\n“I’ve invited him to come and stay with us.”\r\n\r\nRose could only go on staring.\r\n\r\n“It’s the least I could do. Besides—look at this.” Lotty waved her\r\nhand. “Disgusting not to share it. I was a mean dog to go off and leave\r\nhim, but no dog I’ve ever heard of was ever as mean as I’d be if I\r\ndidn’t try and persuade Mellersh to come out and enjoy this too. It’s\r\nbarest decency that he should have some of the fun out of my nest-egg.\r\nAfter all, he has housed me and fed me for years. One shouldn’t be\r\nchurlish.”\r\n\r\n“But—do you think he’ll come?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I _hope_ so,” said Lotty with the utmost earnestness; and added,\r\n“Poor lamb.”\r\n\r\nAt that Rose felt she would like to sit down. Mellersh a poor lamb?\r\nThat same Mellersh who a few hours before was mere shimmer? There was a\r\nseat at the bend of the path, and Rose went to it and sat down. She\r\nwished to get her breath, gain time. If she had time she might perhaps\r\nbe able to catch up the leaping Lotty, and perhaps be able to stop her\r\nbefore she committed herself to what she probably presently would be\r\nsorry for. Mellersh at San Salvatore? Mellersh, from whom Lotty had\r\ntaken such pains so recently to escape?\r\n\r\n“I _see_ him here,” said Lotty, as if in answer to her thoughts.\r\n\r\nRose looked at her with real concern: for every time Lotty said in that\r\nconvinced voice, “I _see_,” what she saw came true. Then it was to be\r\nsupposed that Mr. Wilkins too would presently come true.\r\n\r\n“I wish,” said Rose anxiously, “I understood you.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t try,” said Lotty, smiling.\r\n\r\n“But I must, because I love you.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Rose,” said Lotty, swiftly bending down and kissing her.\r\n\r\n“You’re so quick,” said Rose. “I can’t follow your developments. I\r\ncan’t keep touch. It was what happened with Freder—”\r\n\r\nShe broke off and looked frightened.\r\n\r\n“The whole idea of our coming here,” she went on again, as Lotty didn’t\r\nseem to have noticed, “was to get away, wasn’t it? Well, we’ve got\r\naway. And now, after only a single day of it, you want to write to the\r\nvery people—”\r\n\r\nShe stopped.\r\n\r\n“The very people we were getting away from,” finished Lotty. “It’s\r\nquite true. It seems idiotically illogical. But I’m so happy, I’m so\r\nwell, I feel so fearfully wholesome. This place—why, it makes me feel\r\n_flooded_ with love.”\r\n\r\nAnd she stared down at Rose in a kind of radiant surprise.\r\n\r\nRose was silent a moment. Then she said, “And do you think it will have\r\nthe same effect on Mr. Wilkins?”\r\n\r\nLotty laughed. “I don’t know,” she said. “But even if it doesn’t,\r\nthere’s enough love about to flood fifty Mr. Wilkinses, as you call\r\nhim. The great thing is to have lots of love _about_. I don’t see,” she\r\nwent on, “at least I don’t see here, though I did at home, that it\r\nmatters who loves as long as somebody does. I was a stingy beast at\r\nhome, and used to measure and count. I had a queer obsession about\r\njustice. As though justice mattered. As though justice can really be\r\ndistinguished from vengeance. It’s only love that’s any good. At home I\r\nwouldn’t love Mellersh unless he loved me back, exactly as much,\r\nabsolute fairness. Did you ever. And as he didn’t, neither did I, and\r\nthe _aridity_ of that house! The _aridity_ . . .”\r\n\r\nRose said nothing. She was bewildered by Lotty. One odd effect of San\r\nSalvatore on her rapidly developing friend was her sudden free use of\r\nrobust words. She had not used them in Hampstead. Beast and dog were\r\nmore robust than Hampstead cared about. In words, too, Lotty had come\r\nunchained.\r\n\r\nBut how she wished, oh how Rose wished, that she too could write to her\r\nhusband and say “Come.” The Wilkins _ménage_, however pompous Mellersh\r\nmight be, and he had seemed to Rose pompous, was on a healthier, more\r\nnatural footing than hers. Lotty could write to Mellersh and would get\r\nan answer. She couldn’t write to Frederick, for only too well did she\r\nknow he wouldn’t answer. At least, he might answer—a hurried scribble,\r\nshowing how much bored he was at doing it, with perfunctory thanks for\r\nher letter. But that would be worse than no answer at all; for his\r\nhandwriting, her name on an envelope addressed by him, stabbed her\r\nheart. Too acutely did it bring back the letters of their beginnings\r\ntogether, the letters from him so desolate with separation, so aching\r\nwith love and longing. To see apparently one of these very same letters\r\narrive, and open it and find:\r\n\r\nDear Rose—Thanks for letter. Glad you’re having a good time. Don’t\r\nhurry back. Say if you want any money. Everything going splendidly\r\nhere.—Yours,\r\n                                                         Frederick.\r\n\r\n—no, it couldn’t be borne.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I’ll come down to the village with you to-day,” she\r\nsaid, looking up at Lotty with eyes suddenly gone dim. “I think I want\r\nto think.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Lotty, at once starting off briskly down the path.\r\n“But don’t think too long,” she called back over her shoulder. “Write\r\nand invite him at once.”\r\n\r\n“Invite whom?” asked Rose, startled.\r\n\r\n“Your husband.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the evening meal, which was the first time the whole four sat round\r\nthe dining-room table together, Scrap appeared.\r\n\r\nShe appeared quite punctually, and in one of those wrappers or\r\ntea-gowns which are sometimes described as ravishing. This one really\r\nwas ravishing. It certainly ravished Mrs. Wilkins, who could not take\r\nher eyes off the enchanting figure opposite. It was a shell-pink\r\ngarment, and clung to the adorable Scrap as though it, too, loved her.\r\n\r\n“What a beautiful dress!” exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins eagerly.\r\n\r\n“What—this old rag?” said Scrap, glancing down at it as if to see which\r\none she had got on. “I’ve had it a hundred years.” And she concentrated\r\non her soup.\r\n\r\n“You must be very cold in it,” said Mrs. Fisher, thin-lipped; for it\r\nshowed a great deal of Scrap—the whole of her arms, for instance, and\r\neven where it covered her up it was so thin that you still saw her.\r\n\r\n“Who—me?” said Scrap, looking up a moment. “Oh, no.”\r\n\r\nAnd she continued her soup.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t catch a chill, you know,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, feeling\r\nthat such loveliness must at all costs be preserved unharmed. “There’s\r\na great difference here when the sun goes down.”\r\n\r\n“I’m quite warm,” said Scrap, industriously eating her soup.\r\n\r\n“You look as if you had nothing at all on underneath,” said Mrs.\r\nFisher.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t. At least, hardly anything,” said Scrap, finishing her soup.\r\n\r\n“How very imprudent,” said Mrs. Fisher, “and how highly improper.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon Scrap stared at her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher had arrived at dinner feeling friendly towards Lady\r\nCaroline. She at least had not intruded into her room and sat at her\r\ntable and written with her pen. She did, Mrs. Fisher had supposed, know\r\nhow to behave. Now it appeared that she did not know, for was this\r\nbehaving, to come dressed—no, undressed—like that to a meal? Such\r\nbehaviour was not only exceedingly improper but also most\r\ninconsiderate, for the indelicate creature would certainly catch a\r\nchill, and then infect the entire party. Mrs. Fisher had a great\r\nobjection to other people’s chills. They were always the fruit of\r\nfolly; and then they were handed on to her, who had done nothing at all\r\nto deserve them.\r\n\r\n“Bird-brained,” thought Mrs. Fisher, sternly contemplating Lady\r\nCaroline. “Not an idea in her head except vanity.”\r\n\r\n“But there are no men here,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “so how can it be\r\nimproper? Have you noticed,” she inquired of Mrs. Fisher, who\r\nendeavoured to pretend she did not hear, “how difficult it is to be\r\nimproper without men?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher neither answered her nor looked at her; but Scrap looked at\r\nher, and did that with her mouth which in any other mouth would have\r\nbeen a faint grin. Seen from without, across the bowl of nasturtiums,\r\nit was the most beautiful of brief and dimpled smiles.\r\n\r\nShe had a very alive sort of face, that one, thought Scrap, observing\r\nMrs. Wilkins with a dawn of interest. It was rather like a field of\r\ncorn swept by lights and shadows. Both she and the dark one, Scrap\r\nnoticed, had changed their clothes, but only in order to put on silk\r\njumpers. The same amount of trouble would have been enough to dress\r\nthem properly, reflected Scrap. Naturally they looked like nothing on\r\nearth in the jumpers. It didn’t matter what Mrs. Fisher wore; indeed,\r\nthe only thing for her, short of plumes and ermine, was what she did\r\nwear. But these others were quite young still, and quite attractive.\r\nThey really definitely had faces. How different life would be for them\r\nif they made the most of themselves instead of the least. And yet—Scrap\r\nwas suddenly bored, and turned away her thoughts and absently ate\r\ntoast. What did it matter? If you did make the best of yourself, you\r\nonly collected people round you who ended by wanting to grab.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had the most wonderful day,” began Mrs. Wilkins, her eyes\r\nshining.\r\n\r\nScrap lowered hers. “Oh,” she thought, “she’s going to gush.”\r\n\r\n“As though anybody were interested in her day,” thought Mrs. Fisher,\r\nlowering hers also.\r\n\r\nIn fact, whenever Mrs. Wilkins spoke Mrs. Fisher deliberately cast down\r\nher eyes. Thus would she mark her disapproval. Besides, it seemed the\r\nonly safe thing to do with her eyes, for no one could tell what the\r\nuncurbed creature would say next. That which she had just said, for\r\ninstance, about men—addressed too, to her—what could she mean? Better\r\nnot conjecture, thought Mrs. Fisher; and her eyes, though cast down,\r\nyet saw Lady Caroline stretch out her hand to the Chianti flask and\r\nfill her glass again.\r\n\r\nAgain. She had done it once already, and the fish was only just going\r\nout of the room. Mrs. Fisher could see that the other respectable\r\nmember of the party, Mrs. Arbuthnot, was noticing it too. Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot was, she hoped and believed, respectable and well-meaning. It\r\nis true she also had invaded her sitting-room, but no doubt she had\r\nbeen dragged there by the other one, and Mrs. Fisher had little if\r\nanything against Mrs. Arbuthnot, and observed with approval that she\r\nonly drank water. That was as it should be. So, indeed, to give her her\r\ndues, did the freckled one; and very right at their age. She herself\r\ndrank wine, but with what moderation: one meal, one glass. And she was\r\nsixty-five, and might properly, and even beneficially, have had at\r\nleast two.\r\n\r\n“That,” she said to Lady Caroline, cutting right across what Mrs.\r\nWilkins was telling them about her wonderful day and indicating the\r\nwine-glass, “is very bad for you.”\r\n\r\nLady Caroline, however, could not have heard, for she continued to sip,\r\nher elbow on the table, and listen to what Mrs. Wilkins was saying.\r\n\r\nAnd what was it she was saying? She had invited somebody to come and\r\nstay? A man?\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher could not credit her ears. Yet it evidently was a man, for\r\nshe spoke of the person as he.\r\n\r\nSuddenly and for the first time—but then this was most important—Mrs.\r\nFisher addressed Mrs. Wilkins directly. She was sixty-five, and cared\r\nvery little what sorts of women she happened to be with for a month,\r\nbut if the women were to be mixed with men it was a different\r\nproposition altogether. She was not going to be made a cat’s-paw of.\r\nShe had not come out there to sanction by her presence what used in her\r\nday to be called fast behaviour. Nothing had been said at the interview\r\nin London about men; if there had been she would have declined, of\r\ncourse, to come.\r\n\r\n“What is his name?” asked Mrs. Fisher, abruptly interposing.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins turned to her with a slight surprise. “Wilkins,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Wilkins?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Your name?”\r\n\r\n“And his.”\r\n\r\n“A relation?”\r\n\r\n“Not blood.”\r\n\r\n“A connection?”\r\n\r\n“A husband.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher once more cast down her eyes. She could not talk to Mrs.\r\nWilkins. There was something about the things she said. . . “A\r\nhusband.” Suggesting one of many. Always that unseemly twist to\r\neverything. Why could she not say “My husband”? Besides, Mrs. Fisher\r\nhad, she herself knew not for what reason, taken both the Hampstead\r\nyoung women for widows. War ones. There had been an absence of mention\r\nof husbands at the interview which would not, she considered, be\r\nnatural if such persons did after all exist. And if a husband was not a\r\nrelation, who was? “Not blood.” What a way to talk. Why, a husband was\r\nthe first of all relations. How well she remembered Ruskin—no, it was\r\nnot Ruskin, it was the Bible that said a man should leave his father\r\nand mother and cleave only to his wife; showing that she became by\r\nmarriage an even more than blood relation. And if the husband’s father\r\nand mother were to be nothing to him compared to his wife, how much\r\nless than nothing ought the wife’s father and mother be to her compared\r\nto her husband. She herself had been unable to leave her father and\r\nmother in order to cleave to Mr. Fisher because they were no longer,\r\nwhen she married, alive, but she certainly would have left them if they\r\nhad been there to leave. Not blood, indeed. Silly talk.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was very good. Succulence succeeded succulence. Costanza had\r\ndetermined to do as she chose in the matter of cream and eggs the first\r\nweek, and see what happened at the end of it when the bills had to be\r\npaid. Her experience of the English was that they were quiet about\r\nbills. They were shy of words. They believed readily. Besides, who was\r\nthe mistress here? In the absence of a definite one, it occurred to\r\nCostanza that she might as well be the mistress herself. So she did as\r\nshe chose about the dinner, and it was very good.\r\n\r\nThe four, however, were so much preoccupied by their own conversation\r\nthat they ate it without noticing how good it was. Even Mrs. Fisher,\r\nshe who in such matters was manly, did not notice. The entire excellent\r\ncooking was to her as though it were not; which shows how much she must\r\nhave been stirred.\r\n\r\nShe was stirred. It was that Mrs. Wilkins. She was enough to stir\r\nanybody. And she was undoubtedly encouraged by Lady Caroline, who, in\r\nher turn, was no doubt influenced by the Chianti.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher was very glad there were no men present, for they certainly\r\nwould have been foolish about Lady Caroline. She was precisely the sort\r\nof young woman to unbalance them; especially, Mrs. Fisher recognised,\r\nat that moment. Perhaps it was the Chianti momentarily intensifying her\r\npersonality, but she was undeniably most attractive; and there were few\r\nthings Mrs. Fisher disliked more than having to look on while sensible,\r\nintelligent men, who the moment before were talking seriously and\r\ninterestingly about real matters, became merely foolish and\r\nsimpering—she had seen them actually simpering—just because in walked a\r\nbit of bird-brained beauty. Even Mr. Gladstone, that great wise\r\nstatesman, whose hand had once rested for an unforgettable moment\r\nsolemnly on her head, would have, she felt, on perceiving Lady Caroline\r\nleft off talking sense and horribly embarked on badinage.\r\n\r\n“You see,” Mrs. Wilkins said—a silly trick that, with which she mostly\r\nbegan her sentences; Mrs. Fisher each time wished to say, “Pardon me—I\r\ndo not see, I hear”—but why trouble?—“You see,” said Mrs. Wilkins,\r\nleaning across towards Lady Caroline, “we arranged, didn’t we, in\r\nLondon that if any of us wanted to we could each invite one guest. So\r\nnow I’m doing it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t remember that,” said Mrs. Fisher, her eyes on her plate.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, we did—didn’t we, Rose?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—I remember,” said Lady Caroline. “Only it seemed so incredible\r\nthat one could ever want to. One’s whole idea was to get away from\r\none’s friends.”\r\n\r\n“And one’s husbands.”\r\n\r\nAgain that unseemly plural. But how altogether unseemly, thought Mrs.\r\nFisher. Such implications. Mrs. Arbuthnot clearly thought so too, for\r\nshe had turned red.\r\n\r\n“And family affection,” said Lady Caroline—or was it the Chianti\r\nspeaking? Surely it was the Chianti.\r\n\r\n“And the want of family affection,” said Mrs. Wilkins—what a light she\r\nwas throwing on her home life and real character.\r\n\r\n“That wouldn’t be so bad,” said Lady Caroline. “I’d stay with that. It\r\nwould give one room.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no, no—it’s dreadful,” cried Mrs. Wilkins. “It’s as if one had no\r\nclothes on.”\r\n\r\n“But I like that,” said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\n“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“It’s a divine feeling, getting rid of things,” said Lady Caroline, who\r\nwas talking altogether to Mrs. Wilkins and paid no attention to the\r\nother two.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but in a bitter wind to have nothing on and know there never will\r\nbe anything on and you going to get colder and colder till at last you\r\ndie of it—that’s what it was like, living with somebody who didn’t love\r\none.”\r\n\r\nThese confidences, thought Mrs. Fisher . . . and no excuse whatever for\r\nMrs. Wilkins, who was making them entirely on plain water. Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, judging from her face, quite shared Mrs. Fisher’s\r\ndisapproval; she was fidgeting.\r\n\r\n“But didn’t he?” asked Lady Caroline—every bit as shamelessly\r\nunreticent as Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Mellersh? He showed no signs of it.”\r\n\r\n“Delicious,” murmured Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\n“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t think it was at all delicious. I was miserable. And now,\r\nsince I’ve been here, I simply stare at myself being miserable. As\r\nmiserable as that. And about Mellersh.”\r\n\r\n“You mean he wasn’t worth it.”\r\n\r\n“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t. I mean I’ve suddenly got well.”\r\n\r\nLady Caroline, slowly twisting the stem of her glass in her fingers,\r\nscrutinised the lit-up face opposite.\r\n\r\n“And now I’m well I find I can’t sit here and gloat all to myself. I\r\ncan’t be happy, shutting him out. I must share. I understand exactly\r\nwhat the Blessed Damozel felt like.”\r\n\r\n“What was the Blessed Damozel?” asked Scrap.\r\n\r\n“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher; and with such emphasis this time that Lady\r\nCaroline turned to her.\r\n\r\n“Ought I to know?” she asked. “I don’t know any natural history. It\r\nsounds like a bird.”\r\n\r\n“It is a poem,” said Mrs. Fisher with extraordinary frost.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Scrap.\r\n\r\n“I’ll lend it to you,” said Mrs. Wilkins, over whose face laughter\r\nrippled.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Scrap.\r\n\r\n“And its author,” said Mrs. Fisher icily, “though not perhaps quite\r\nwhat one would have wished him to be, was frequently at my father’s\r\ntable.”\r\n\r\n“What a bore for you,” said Scrap. “That’s what mother’s always\r\ndoing—inviting authors. I hate authors. I wouldn’t mind them so much if\r\nthey didn’t write books. Go on about Mellersh,” she said, turning to\r\nMrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“All those empty beds,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“What empty beds?” asked Scrap.\r\n\r\n“The ones in this house. Why, of course they each ought to have\r\nsomebody happy inside them. Eight beds, and only four people. It’s\r\ndreadful, dreadful to be so greedy and keep everything just for\r\noneself. I want Rose to ask her husband out too. You and Mrs. Fisher\r\nhaven’t got husbands, but why not give some friend a glorious time?”\r\n\r\nRose bit her lip. She turned red, she turned pale. If only Lotty would\r\nkeep quiet, she thought. It was all very well to have suddenly become a\r\nsaint and want to love everybody, but need she be so tactless? Rose\r\nfelt that all her poor sore places were being danced on. If only Lotty\r\nwould keep quiet . . .\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Fisher, with even greater frostiness than that with which she\r\nhad received Lady Caroline’s ignorance of the Blessed Damozel, said,\r\n“There is only one unoccupied bedroom in this house.”\r\n\r\n“Only one?” echoed Mrs. Wilkins, astonished. “Then who are in all the\r\nothers?”\r\n\r\n“We are,” said Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“But we’re not in all the bedrooms. There must be at least six. That\r\nleaves two over, and the owner told us there were eight beds—didn’t he\r\nRose?”\r\n\r\n“There are six bedrooms,” said Mrs. Fisher; for both she and Lady\r\nCaroline had thoroughly searched the house on arriving, in order to see\r\nwhich part of it they would be most comfortable in, and they both knew\r\nthat there were six bedrooms, two of which were very small, and in one\r\nof these small ones Francesca slept in the company of a chair and a\r\nchest of drawers, and the other, similarly furnished, was empty.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins and Mrs. Arbuthnot had hardly looked at the house, having\r\nspent most of their time out-of-doors gaping at the scenery, and had,\r\nin the agitated inattentiveness of their minds when first they began\r\nnegotiating for San Salvatore, got into their heads that the eight beds\r\nof which the owner spoke were the same as eight bedrooms; which they\r\nwere not. There were indeed eight beds, but four of them were in Mrs.\r\nWilkins’s and Mrs. Arbuthnot’s rooms.\r\n\r\n“There are six bedrooms,” repeated Mrs. Fisher. “We have four,\r\nFrancesca has the fifth, and the sixth is empty.”\r\n\r\n“So that,” said Scrap, “however kind we feel we would be if we could,\r\nwe can’t. Isn’t it fortunate?”\r\n\r\n“But then there’s only room for one?” said Mrs. Wilkins, looking round\r\nat the three faces.\r\n\r\n“Yes—and you’ve got him,” said Scrap.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins was taken aback. This question of the beds was unexpected.\r\nIn inviting Mellersh she had intended to put him in one of the four\r\nspare-rooms that she imagined were there. When there were plenty of\r\nrooms and enough servants there was no reason why they should, as they\r\ndid in their small, two-servanted house at home, share the same one.\r\nLove, even universal love, the kind of love with which she felt herself\r\nflooded, should not be tried. Much patience and self-effacement were\r\nneeded for successful married sleep. Placidity; a steady faith; these\r\ntoo were needed. She was sure she would be much fonder of Mellersh, and\r\nhe not mind her nearly so much, if they were not shut up together at\r\nnight, if in the morning they could meet with the cheery affection of\r\nfriends between whom lies no shadow of differences about the window or\r\nthe washing arrangements, or of absurd little choked-down resentments\r\nat something that had seemed to one of them unfair. Her happiness, she\r\nfelt, and her ability to be friends with everybody, was the result of\r\nher sudden new freedom and its peace. Would there be that sense of\r\nfreedom, that peace, after a night shut up with Mellersh? Would she be\r\nable in the morning to be full towards him, as she was at that moment\r\nfull, of nothing at all but loving-kindness? After all, she hadn’t been\r\nvery long in heaven. Suppose she hadn’t been in it long enough for her\r\nto have become fixed in blandness? And only that morning what an\r\nextraordinary joy it had been to find herself alone when she woke, and\r\nable to pull the bed-clothes any way she liked!\r\n\r\nFrancesca had to nudge her. She was so much absorbed that she did not\r\nnotice the pudding.\r\n\r\n“If,” thought Mrs. Wilkins, distractedly helping herself, “I share my\r\nroom with Mellersh I risk losing all I now feel about him. If on the\r\nother hand I put him in the one spare-room, I prevent Mrs. Fisher and\r\nLady Caroline from giving somebody a treat. True they don’t seem to\r\nwant to at present, but at any moment in this place one or the other of\r\nthem may be seized with a desire to make somebody happy, and then they\r\nwouldn’t be able to because of Mellersh.”\r\n\r\n“What a problem,” she said aloud, her eyebrows puckered.\r\n\r\n“What is?” asked Scrap.\r\n\r\n“Where to put Mellersh.”\r\n\r\nScrap stared. “Why, isn’t one room enough for him?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, quite. But then there won’t be any room left at all—any room\r\nfor somebody you may want to invite.”\r\n\r\n“I shan’t want to,” said Scrap.\r\n\r\n“Or _you_,” said Mrs. Wilkins to Mrs. Fisher. “Rose, of course, doesn’t\r\ncount. I’m sure she would like sharing her room with her husband. It’s\r\nwritten all over her.”\r\n\r\n“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“Really what?” asked Mrs. Wilkins, turning hopefully to her, for she\r\nthought the word this time was the preliminary to a helpful suggestion.\r\n\r\nIt was not. It stood by itself. It was, as before, mere frost.\r\n\r\nChallenged, however, Mrs. Fisher did fasten it on to a sentence.\r\n“Really am I to understand,” she asked, “that you propose to reserve\r\nthe one spare-room for the exclusive use of your own family?”\r\n\r\n“He isn’t my own family,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “He’s my husband. You\r\nsee—”\r\n\r\n“I see nothing,” Mrs. Fisher could not this time refrain from\r\ninterrupting—for what an intolerable trick. “At the most I hear, and\r\nthat reluctantly.”\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Wilkins, as impervious to rebuke as Mrs. Fisher had feared,\r\nimmediately repeated the tiresome formula and launched out into a long\r\nand excessively indelicate speech about the best place for the person\r\nshe called Mellersh to sleep in.\r\n\r\nMellersh—Mrs. Fisher, remembering the Thomases and Johns and Alfreds\r\nand Roberts of her day, plain names that yet had all become glorious,\r\nthought it sheer affectation to be christened Mellersh—was, it seemed,\r\nMrs. Wilkins’s husband, and therefore his place was clearly indicated.\r\nWhy this talk? She herself, as if foreseeing his arrival, had had a\r\nsecond bed put in Mrs. Wilkins’s room. There were certain things in\r\nlife which were never talked about but only done. Most things connected\r\nwith husbands were not talked about; and to have a whole dinner-table\r\ntaken up with a discussion as to where one of them should sleep was an\r\naffront to the decencies. How and where husbands slept should be known\r\nonly to their wives. Sometimes it was not known to them, and then the\r\nmarriage had less happy moments; but these moments were not talked\r\nabout either; the decencies continued to be preserved. At least, it was\r\nso in her day. To have to hear whether Mr. Wilkins should or should not\r\nsleep with Mrs. Wilkins, and the reasons why he should and the reasons\r\nwhy he shouldn’t, was both uninteresting and indelicate.\r\n\r\nShe might have succeeded in imposing propriety and changing the\r\nconversation if it had not been for Lady Caroline. Lady Caroline\r\nencouraged Mrs. Wilkins, and threw herself into the discussion with\r\nevery bit as much unreserve as Mrs. Wilkins herself. No doubt she was\r\nimpelled on this occasion by Chianti, but whatever the reason there it\r\nwas. And, characteristically, Lady Caroline was all for Mr. Wilkins\r\nbeing given the solitary spare-room. She took that for granted. Any\r\nother arrangement would be impossible, she said; her expression was,\r\n“Barbarous.” Had she never read her Bible, Mrs. Fisher was tempted to\r\ninquire—_And they two shall be one flesh?_ Clearly also, then, one\r\nroom. But Mrs. Fisher did not inquire. She did not care even to allude\r\nto such texts to some one unmarried.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was one way she could force Mr. Wilkins into his proper\r\nplace and save the situation: she could say she herself intended to\r\ninvite a friend. It was her right. They had all said so. Apart from\r\npropriety, it was monstrous that Mrs. Wilkins should want to monopolise\r\nthe one spare-room, when in her own room was everything necessary for\r\nher husband. Perhaps she really would invite somebody—not invite, but\r\nsuggest coming. There was Kate Lumley, for instance. Kate could\r\nperfectly afford to come and pay her share; and she was of her own\r\nperiod and knew, and had known, most of the people she herself knew and\r\nhad known. Kate, of course, had only been on the fringe; she used to be\r\nasked only to the big parties, not to the small ones, and she still was\r\nonly on the fringe. There were some people who never got off the\r\nfringe, and Kate was one. Often, however, such people were more\r\npermanently agreeable to be with than the others, in that they remained\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\nYes; she might really consider Kate. The poor soul had never married,\r\nbut then everybody could not expect to marry, and she was quite\r\ncomfortably off—not too comfortably, but just comfortably enough to pay\r\nher own expenses if she came and yet be grateful. Yes; Kate was the\r\nsolution. If she came, at one stroke, Mrs. Fisher saw, would the\r\nWilkinses be regularised and Mrs. Wilkins be prevented from having more\r\nthan her share of the rooms. Also, Mrs. Fisher would save herself from\r\nisolation; spiritual isolation. She desired physical isolation between\r\nmeals, but she disliked that isolation which is of the spirit. Such\r\nisolation would, she feared, certainly be hers with these three\r\nalien-minded young women. Even Mrs. Arbuthnot was, owing to her\r\nfriendship with Mrs. Wilkins, necessarily alien-minded. In Kate she\r\nwould have a support. Kate, without intruding on her sitting-room, for\r\nKate was tractable, would be there at meals to support her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher said nothing at the moment; but presently in the\r\ndrawing-room, when they were gathered round the wood fire—she had\r\ndiscovered there was no fireplace in her own sitting-room, and\r\ntherefore she would after all be forced, so long as the evenings\r\nremained cool, to spend them in the other room—presently, while\r\nFrancesca was handing coffee round and Lady Caroline was poisoning the\r\nair with smoke, Mrs. Wilkins, looking relieved and pleased, said:\r\n“Well, if nobody really wants that room, and wouldn’t use it anyhow, I\r\nshall be very glad if Mellersh may have it.”\r\n\r\n“Of course he must have it,” said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Fisher spoke.\r\n\r\n“I have a friend,” she said in her deep voice; and sudden silence fell\r\nupon the others.\r\n\r\n“Kate Lumley,” said Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\nNobody spoke.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” continued Mrs. Fisher, addressing Lady Caroline, “you know\r\nher?”\r\n\r\nNo, Lady Caroline did not know Kate Lumley; and Mrs. Fisher, without\r\nasking the others if they did, for she was sure they knew no one,\r\nproceeded. “I wish to invite her to join me,” said Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\nComplete silence.\r\n\r\nThen Scrap said, turning to Mrs. Wilkins, “That settles Mellersh,\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\n“It settles the question of Mr. Wilkins,” said Mrs. Fisher, “although I\r\nam unable to understand that there should ever have been a question, in\r\nthe only way that is right.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you’re in for it, then,” said Lady Caroline, again to Mrs.\r\nWilkins. “Unless,” she added, “he can’t come.”\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Wilkins, her brow perturbed—for suppose after all she were not\r\nyet quite stable in heaven?—could only say, a little uneasily, “I _see_\r\nhim here.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\n\r\nThe uneventful days—only outwardly uneventful—slipped by in floods of\r\nsunshine, and the servants, watching the four ladies, came to the\r\nconclusion there was very little life in them.\r\n\r\nTo the servants San Salvatore seemed asleep. No one came to tea, nor\r\ndid the ladies go anywhere to tea. Other tenants in other springs had\r\nbeen far more active. There had been stir and enterprise; the boat had\r\nbeen used; excursions had been made; Beppo’s fly was ordered; people\r\nfrom Mezzago came over and spent the day; the house rang with voices;\r\neven sometimes champagne had been drunk. Life was varied, life was\r\ninteresting. But this? What was this? The servants were not even\r\nscolded. They were left completely to themselves. They yawned.\r\n\r\nPerplexing, too, was the entire absence of gentlemen. How could\r\ngentlemen keep away from so much beauty? For, added up, and even after\r\nthe subtraction of the old one, the three younger ladies produced a\r\nformidable total of that which gentlemen usually sought.\r\n\r\nAlso the evident desire of each lady to spend long hours separated from\r\nthe other ladies puzzled the servants. The result was a deathly\r\nstillness in the house, except at meal-times. It might have been as\r\nempty as it had been all the winter, for any sounds of life there were.\r\nThe old lady sat in her room, alone; the dark-eyed lady wandered off\r\nalone, loitering, so Domenico told them, who sometimes came across her\r\nin the course of his duties, incomprehensibly among the rocks; the very\r\nbeautiful fair lady lay in her low chair in the top garden, alone; the\r\nless, but still beautiful fair lady went up the hills and stayed up\r\nthem for hours, alone; and every day the sun blazed slowly round the\r\nhouse, and disappeared at evening into the sea, and nothing at all had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nThe servants yawned.\r\n\r\nYet the four visitors, while their bodies sat—that was Mrs. Fisher’s—or\r\nlay—that was Lady Caroline’s—or loitered—that was Mrs. Arbuthnot’s—or\r\nwent in solitude up into the hills—that was Mrs. Wilkins’s—were\r\nanything but torpid really. Their minds were unusually busy. Even at\r\nnight their minds were busy, and the dreams they had were clear, thin,\r\nquick things, entirely different from the heavy dreams of home. There\r\nwas that in the atmosphere of San Salvatore which produced\r\nactive-mindedness in all except the natives. They, as before, whatever\r\nthe beauty around them, whatever the prodigal seasons did, remained\r\nimmune from thoughts other than those they were accustomed to. All\r\ntheir lives they had seen, year by year, the amazing recurrent\r\nspectacle of April in the gardens, and custom had made it invisible to\r\nthem. They were as blind to it, as unconscious of it, as Domenico’s dog\r\nasleep in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe visitors could not be blind to it—it was too arresting after London\r\nin a particularly wet and gloomy March. Suddenly to be transported to\r\nthat place where the air was so still that it held its breath, where\r\nthe light was so golden that the most ordinary things were\r\ntransfigured—to be transported into that delicate warmth, that\r\ncaressing fragrance, and to have the old grey castle as the setting,\r\nand, in the distance, the serene clear hills of Perugini’s backgrounds,\r\nwas an astonishing contrast. Even Lady Caroline, used all her life to\r\nbeauty, who had been everywhere and seen everything, felt the surprise\r\nof it. It was, that year, a particularly wonderful spring, and of all\r\nthe months at San Salvatore April, if the weather was fine, was best.\r\nMay scorched and withered; March was restless, and could be hard and\r\ncold in its brightness; but April came along softly like a blessing,\r\nand if it were a fine April it was so beautiful that it was impossible\r\nnot to feel different, not to feel stirred and touched.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins, we have seen, responded to it instantly. She, so to\r\nspeak, at once flung off all her garments and dived straight into\r\nglory, unhesitatingly, with a cry of rapture.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot was stirred and touched, but differently. She had odd\r\nsensations—presently to be described.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher, being old, was of a closer, more impermeable texture, and\r\noffered more resistance; but she too had odd sensations, also in their\r\nplace to be described.\r\n\r\nLady Caroline, already amply acquainted with beautiful houses and\r\nclimates, to whom they could not come quite with the same surprise, yet\r\nwas very nearly as quick to react as Mrs. Wilkins. The place had an\r\nalmost instantaneous influence on her as well, and of one part of this\r\ninfluence she was aware: it had made her, beginning on the very first\r\nevening, want to think, and acted on her curiously like a conscience.\r\nWhat this conscience seemed to press upon her notice with an insistence\r\nthat startled her—Lady Caroline hesitated to accept the word, but it\r\nwould keep on coming into her head—was that she was tawdry.\r\n\r\nTawdry. She. Fancy.\r\n\r\nShe must think that out.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the first dinner together, she woke up in a condition\r\nof regret that she should have been so talkative to Mrs. Wilkins the\r\nnight before. What had made her be, she wondered. Now, of course, Mrs.\r\nWilkins would want to grab, she would want to be inseparable; and the\r\nthought of a grabbing and an inseparableness that should last four\r\nweeks made Scrap’s spirit swoon within her. No doubt the encouraged\r\nMrs. Wilkins would be lurking in the top garden waiting to waylay her\r\nwhen she went out, and would hail her with morning cheerfulness. How\r\nmuch she hated being hailed with morning cheerfulness—or indeed, hailed\r\nat all. She oughtn’t to have encouraged Mrs. Wilkins the night before.\r\nFatal to encourage. It was bad enough not to encourage, for just\r\nsitting there and saying nothing seemed usually to involve her, but\r\nactively to encourage was suicidal. What on earth had made her? Now she\r\nwould have to waste all the precious time, the precious, lovely time\r\nfor thinking in, for getting square with herself, in shaking Mrs.\r\nWilkins off.\r\n\r\nWith great caution and on the tips of her toes, balancing herself\r\ncarefully lest the pebbles should scrunch, she stole out when she was\r\ndressed to her corner; but the garden was empty. No shaking off was\r\nnecessary. Neither Mrs. Wilkins nor anybody else was to be seen. She\r\nhad it entirely to herself. Except for Domenico, who presently came and\r\nhovered, watering his plants, again especially all the plants that were\r\nnearest her, no one came out at all; and when, after a long while of\r\nfollowing up thoughts which seemed to escape her just as she had got\r\nthem, and dropping off exhausted to sleep in the intervals of this\r\nchase, she felt hungry and looked at her watch and saw that it was past\r\nthree, she realised that nobody had even bothered to call her in to\r\nlunch. So that, Scrap could not but remark, if any one was shaken off\r\nit was she herself.\r\n\r\nWell, but how delightful, and how very new. Now she would really be\r\nable to think, uninterruptedly. Delicious to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nStill, she was hungry; and Mrs. Wilkins, after that excessive\r\nfriendliness the night before, might at least have told her lunch was\r\nready. And she had really been excessively friendly—so nice about\r\nMellersh’s sleeping arrangements, wanting him to have the spare-room\r\nand all. She wasn’t usually interested in arrangements, in fact she\r\nwasn’t ever interested in them; so that Scrap considered she might be\r\nsaid almost to have gone out of her way to be agreeable to Mrs.\r\nWilkins. And, in return, Mrs. Wilkins didn’t even bother whether or not\r\nshe had any lunch.\r\n\r\nFortunately, though she was hungry, she didn’t mind missing a meal.\r\nLife was full of meals. They took up an enormous proportion of one’s\r\ntime; and Mrs. Fisher was, she was afraid, one of those persons who at\r\nmeals linger. Twice now had she dined with Mrs. Fisher, and each time\r\nshe had been difficult at the end to dislodge, lingering on slowly\r\ncracking innumerable nuts and slowly drinking a glass of wine that\r\nseemed as if it would never be finished. Probably it would be a good\r\nthing to make a habit of missing lunch, and as it was quite easy to\r\nhave tea brought out to her, and as she breakfasted in her room, only\r\nonce a day would she have to sit at the dining-room table and endure\r\nthe nuts.\r\n\r\nScrap burrowed her head comfortably in the cushions, and with her feet\r\ncrossed on the low parapet gave herself up to more thought. She said to\r\nherself, as she had said at intervals throughout the morning: Now I’m\r\ngoing to think. But, never having thought out anything in her life, it\r\nwas difficult. Extraordinary how one’s attention wouldn’t stay fixed;\r\nextraordinary how one’s mind slipped sideways. Settling herself down to\r\na review of her past as a preliminary to the consideration of her\r\nfuture, and hunting in it to begin with for any justification of that\r\ndistressing word tawdry, the next thing she knew was that she wasn’t\r\nthinking about this at all, but had somehow switched on to Mr. Wilkins.\r\n\r\nWell, Mr. Wilkins was quite easy to think about, though not pleasant.\r\nShe viewed his approach with misgivings. For not only was it a profound\r\nand unexpected bore to have a man added to the party, and a man, too,\r\nof the kind she was sure Mr. Wilkins must be, but she was afraid—and\r\nher fear was the result of a drearily unvarying experience—that he\r\nmight wish to hang about her.\r\n\r\nThis possibility had evidently not yet occurred to Mrs. Wilkins, and it\r\nwas not one to which she could very well draw her attention; not, that\r\nis, without being too fatuous to live. She tried to hope that Mr.\r\nWilkins would be a wonderful exception to the dreadful rule. If only he\r\nwere, she would be so much obliged to him that she believed she might\r\nreally quite like him.\r\n\r\nBut—she had misgivings. Suppose he hung about her so that she was\r\ndriven from her lovely top garden; suppose the light in Mrs. Wilkins’s\r\nfunny, flickering face was blown out. Scrap felt she would particularly\r\ndislike this to happen to Mrs. Wilkins’s face, yet she had never in her\r\nlife met any wives, not any at all, who had been able to understand\r\nthat she didn’t in the least want their husbands. Often she had met\r\nwives who didn’t want their husbands either, but that made them none\r\nthe less indignant if they thought somebody else did, and none the less\r\nsure, when they saw them hanging round Scrap, that she was trying to\r\nget them. Trying to get them! The bare thought, the bare recollection\r\nof these situations, filled her with a boredom so extreme that it\r\ninstantly sent her to sleep again.\r\n\r\nWhen she woke up she went on with Mr. Wilkins.\r\n\r\nNow if, thought Scrap, Mr. Wilkins were not an exception and behaved in\r\nthe usual way, would Mrs. Wilkins understand, or would it just simply\r\nspoil her holiday? She seemed quick, but would she be quick about just\r\nthis? She seemed to understand and see inside one, but would she\r\nunderstand and see inside one when it came to Mr. Wilkins?\r\n\r\nThe experienced Scrap was full of doubts. She shifted her feet on the\r\nparapet; she jerked a cushion straight. Perhaps she had better try and\r\nexplain to Mrs. Wilkins, during the days still remaining before the\r\narrival—explain in a general way, rather vague and talking at large—her\r\nattitude towards such things. She might also expound to her her\r\npeculiar dislike of people’s husbands, and her profound craving to be,\r\nat least for this one month, let alone.\r\n\r\nBut Scrap had her doubts about this too. Such talk meant a certain\r\nfamiliarity, meant embarking on a friendship with Mrs. Wilkins; and if,\r\nafter having embarked on it and faced the peril it contained of too\r\nmuch Mrs. Wilkins, Mr. Wilkins should turn out to be artful—and people\r\ndid get very artful when they were set on anything—and manage after all\r\nto slip through into the top garden, Mrs. Wilkins might easily believe\r\nshe had been taken in, and that she, Scrap, was deceitful. Deceitful!\r\nAnd about Mr. Wilkins. Wives were really pathetic.\r\n\r\nAt half-past four she heard sounds of saucers on the other side of the\r\ndaphne bushes. Was tea being sent out to her?\r\n\r\nNo; the sounds came no closer, they stopped near the house. Tea was to\r\nbe in the garden, in her garden. Scrap considered she might at least\r\nhave been asked if she minded being disturbed. They all knew she sat\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some one would bring hers to her in her corner.\r\n\r\nNo; nobody brought anything.\r\n\r\nWell, she was too hungry not to go and have it with the others to-day,\r\nbut she would give Francesca strict orders for the future.\r\n\r\nShe got up, and walked with that slow grace which was another of her\r\noutrageous number of attractions towards the sounds of tea. She was\r\nconscious not only of being very hungry but of wanting to talk to Mrs.\r\nWilkins again. Mrs. Wilkins had not grabbed, she had left her quite\r\nfree all day in spite of the _rapprochement_ the night before. Of\r\ncourse she was an original, and put on a silk jumper for dinner, but\r\nshe hadn’t grabbed. This was a great thing. Scrap went towards the\r\ntea-table quite looking forward to Mrs. Wilkins; and when she came in\r\nsight of it she saw only Mrs. Fisher and Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher was pouring out the tea, and Mrs. Arbuthnot was offering\r\nMrs. Fisher macaroons. Every time Mrs. Fisher offered Mrs. Arbuthnot\r\nanything—her cup, or milk, or sugar—Mrs. Arbuthnot offered her\r\nmacaroons—pressed them on her with an odd assiduousness, almost with\r\nobstinacy. Was it a game? Scrap wondered, sitting down and seizing a\r\nmacaroon.\r\n\r\n“Where is Mrs. Wilkins?” asked Scrap.\r\n\r\nThey did not know. At least, Mrs. Arbuthnot, on Scrap’s inquiry, did\r\nnot know; Mrs. Fisher’s face, at the name, became elaborately\r\nuninterested.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Mrs. Wilkins had not been seen since breakfast. Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot thought she had probably gone for a picnic. Scrap missed her.\r\nShe ate the enormous macaroons, the best and biggest she had ever come\r\nacross, in silence. Tea without Mrs. Wilkins was dull; and Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot had that fatal flavour of motherliness about her, of wanting\r\nto pet one, to make one very comfortable, coaxing one to eat—coaxing\r\nher, who was already so frankly, so even excessively, eating—that\r\nseemed to have dogged Scrap’s steps through life. Couldn’t people leave\r\none alone? She was perfectly able to eat what she wanted unincited. She\r\ntried to quench Mrs. Arbuthnot’s zeal by being short with her. Useless.\r\nThe shortness was not apparent. It remained, as all Scrap’s evil\r\nfeelings remained, covered up by the impenetrable veil of her\r\nloveliness.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher sat monumentally, and took no notice of either of them. She\r\nhad had a curious day, and was a little worried. She had been quite\r\nalone, for none of the three had come to lunch, and none of them had\r\ntaken the trouble to let her know they were not coming; and Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, drifting casually into tea, had behaved oddly till Lady\r\nCaroline joined them and distracted her attention.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher was prepared not to dislike Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose parted\r\nhair and mild expression seemed very decent and womanly, but she\r\ncertainly had habits that were difficult to like. Her habit of\r\ninstantly echoing any offer made her of food or drink, of throwing the\r\noffer back on one, as it were, was not somehow what one expected of\r\nher. “Will you have some more tea?” was surely a question to which the\r\nanswer was simply yes or no; but Mrs. Arbuthnot persisted in the trick\r\nshe had exhibited the day before at breakfast, of adding to her yes\r\nor no the words, “Will _you?_” She had done it again that morning at\r\nbreakfast and here she was doing it at tea—the two meals at which Mrs.\r\nFisher presided and poured out. Why did she do it? Mrs. Fisher failed\r\nto understand.\r\n\r\nBut this was not what was worrying her; this was merely by the way.\r\nWhat was worrying her was that she had been quite unable that day to\r\nsettle to anything, and had done nothing but wander restlessly from her\r\nsitting-room to her battlements and back again. It had been a wasted\r\nday, and how much she disliked waste. She had tried to read, and she\r\nhad tried to write to Kate Lumley; but no—a few words read, a few lines\r\nwritten, and up she got again and went out on to the battlements and\r\nstared at the sea.\r\n\r\nIt did not matter that the letter to Kate Lumley should not be written.\r\nThere was time enough for that. Let the others suppose her coming was\r\ndefinitely fixed. All the better. So would Mr. Wilkins be kept out of\r\nthe spare-room and put where he belonged. Kate would keep. She could be\r\nheld in reserve. Kate in reserve was just as potent as Kate in\r\nactuality, and there were points about Kate in reserve which might be\r\nmissing from Kate in actuality. For instance, if Mrs. Fisher were going\r\nto be restless, she would rather Kate were not there to see. There was\r\na want of dignity about restlessness, about trotting backwards and\r\nforwards. But it did matter that she could not read a sentence of any\r\nof her great dead friends’ writings; no, not even of Browning’s, who\r\nhad been so much in Italy, nor of Ruskin’s, whose _Stones of Venice_\r\nshe had brought with her to re-read so nearly on the very spot; nor\r\neven a sentence of a really interesting book like the one she had found\r\nin her sitting-room about the home life of the German Emperor, poor\r\nman—written in the nineties, when he had not yet begun to be more\r\nsinned against than sinning, which was, she was firmly convinced, what\r\nwas the matter with him now, and full of exciting things about his\r\nbirth and his right arm and _accoucheurs_—without having to put it down\r\nand go and stare at the sea.\r\n\r\nReading was very important; the proper exercise and development of\r\none’s mind was a paramount duty. How could one read if one were\r\nconstantly trotting in and out? Curious, this restlessness. Was she\r\ngoing to be ill? No, she felt well; indeed, unusually well, and she\r\nwent in and out quite quickly—trotted, in fact—and without her stick.\r\nVery odd that she shouldn’t be able to sit still, she thought, frowning\r\nacross the tops of some purple hyacinths at the Gulf of Spezia\r\nglittering beyond a headland; very odd that she, who walked so slowly,\r\nwith such dependence on her stick, should suddenly trot.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to talk to some one about it, she felt. Not to\r\nKate—to a stranger. Kate would only look at her and suggest a cup of\r\ntea. Kate always suggested cups of tea. Besides, Kate had a flat face.\r\nThat Mrs. Wilkins, now—annoying as she was, loose-tongued as she was,\r\nimpertinent, objectionable, would probably understand, and perhaps know\r\nwhat was making her be like this. But she could say nothing to Mrs.\r\nWilkins. She was the last person to whom one would admit sensations.\r\nDignity alone forbade it. Confide in Mrs. Wilkins? Never.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Arbuthnot, while she wistfully mothered the obstructive Scrap\r\nat tea, felt too that she had had a curious day. Like Mrs. Fisher’s, it\r\nhad been active, but, unlike Mrs. Fisher’s, only active in mind. Her\r\nbody had been quite still; her mind had not been still at all, it had\r\nbeen excessively active. For years she had taken care to have no time\r\nto think. Her scheduled life in the parish had prevented memories and\r\ndesires from intruding on her. That day they had crowded. She went back\r\nto tea feeling dejected, and that she should feel dejected in such a\r\nplace with everything about her to make her rejoice, only dejected her\r\nthe more. But how could she rejoice alone? How could anybody rejoice\r\nand enjoy and appreciate, really appreciate, alone? Except Lotty. Lotty\r\nseemed able to. She had gone off down the hill directly after\r\nbreakfast, alone yet obviously rejoicing, for she had not suggested\r\nthat Rose should go too, and she was singing as she went.\r\n\r\nRose had spent the day by herself, sitting with her hands clasping her\r\nknees, staring straight in front of her. What she was staring at were\r\nthe grey swords of the agaves, and, on their tall stalks, the pale\r\nirises that grew in the remote place she had found, while beyond them,\r\nbetween the grey leaves and the blue flowers, she saw the sea. The\r\nplace she had found was a hidden corner where the sun-baked stones were\r\npadded with thyme, and nobody was likely to come. It was out of sight\r\nand sound of the house; it was off any path; it was near the end of the\r\npromontory. She sat so quiet that presently lizards darted over her\r\nfeet, and some tiny birds like finches, frightened away at first, came\r\nback again and flitted among the bushes round her just as if she hadn’t\r\nbeen there. How beautiful it was. And what was the good of it with no\r\none there, no one who loved being with one, who belonged to one, to\r\nwhom one could say, “Look.” And wouldn’t one say, “Look—_dearest?_”\r\nYes, one would say _dearest_ and the sweet word, just to say it to\r\nsomebody who loved one, would make one happy.\r\n\r\nShe sat quite still, staring straight in front of her. Strange that in\r\nthis place she did not want to pray. She who had prayed so constantly\r\nat home didn’t seem able to do it here at all. The first morning she\r\nhad merely thrown up a brief thank you to heaven on getting out of bed,\r\nand had gone straight to the window to see what everything looked\r\nlike—thrown up the thank you as carelessly as a ball, and thought no\r\nmore about it. That morning, remembering this and ashamed, she had\r\nknelt down with determination; but perhaps determination was bad for\r\nprayers, for she had been unable to think of a thing to say. And as for\r\nher bedtime prayers, on neither of the nights had she said a single\r\none. She had forgotten them. She had been so much absorbed in other\r\nthoughts that she had forgotten them; and, once in bed, she was asleep\r\nand whirling along among bright, thin swift dreams before she had so\r\nmuch time as to stretch herself out.\r\n\r\nWhat had come over her? Why had she let go the anchor of prayer? And\r\nshe had difficulty, too, in remembering her poor, in remembering even\r\nthat there were such things as poor. Holidays, of course, were good,\r\nand were recognised by everybody as good, but ought they so completely\r\nto blot out, to make such havoc of, the realities? Perhaps it was\r\nhealthy to forget her poor; with all the greater gusto would she go\r\nback to them. But it couldn’t be healthy to forget her prayers, and\r\nstill less could it be healthy not to mind.\r\n\r\nRose did not mind. She knew she did not mind. And, even worse, she knew\r\nshe did not mind not minding. In this place she was indifferent to both\r\nthe things that had filled her life and made it seem as if it were\r\nhappy for years. Well, if only she could rejoice in her wonderful new\r\nsurroundings, have that much at least to set against the indifference,\r\nthe letting go—but she could not. She had no work; she did not pray;\r\nshe was left empty.\r\n\r\nLotty had spoilt her day that day, as she had spoilt her day the day\r\nbefore—Lotty, with her invitation to her husband, with her suggestion\r\nthat she too should invite hers. Having flung Frederick into her mind\r\nagain the day before, Lotty had left her; for the whole afternoon she\r\nhad left her alone with her thoughts. Since then they had been all of\r\nFrederick. Where at Hampstead he came to her only in her dreams, here\r\nhe left her dreams free and was with her during the day instead. And\r\nagain that morning, as she was struggling not to think of him, Lotty\r\nhad asked her, just before disappearing singing down the path, if she\r\nhad written yet and invited him, and again he was flung into her mind\r\nand she wasn’t able to get him out.\r\n\r\nHow could she invite him? It had gone on so long, their estrangement,\r\nsuch years; she would hardly know what words to use; and besides, he\r\nwould not come. Why should he come? He didn’t care about being with\r\nher. What could they talk about? Between them was the barrier of his\r\nwork and her religion. She could not—how could she, believing as she\r\ndid in purity, in responsibility for the effect of one’s actions on\r\nothers—bear his work, bear living by it; and he, she knew, had at first\r\nresented and then been merely bored by her religion. He had let her\r\nslip away; he had given her up; he no longer minded; he accepted her\r\nreligion indifferently, as a settled fact. Both it and she—Rose’s mind,\r\nbecoming more luminous in the clear light of April at San Salvatore,\r\nsuddenly saw the truth—bored him.\r\n\r\nNaturally when she saw this, when that morning it flashed upon her for\r\nthe first time, she did not like it; she liked it so little that for a\r\nspace the whole beauty of Italy was blotted out. What was to be done\r\nabout it? She could not give up believing in good and not liking evil,\r\nand it must be evil to live entirely on the proceeds of adulteries,\r\nhowever dead and distinguished they were. Besides, if she did, if she\r\nsacrificed her whole past, her bringing up, her work for the last ten\r\nyears, would she bore him less? Rose felt right down at her very roots\r\nthat if you have once thoroughly bored somebody it is next to\r\nimpossible to unbore him. Once a bore always a bore—certainly, she\r\nthought, to the person originally bored.\r\n\r\nThen, thought she, looking out to sea through eyes grown misty, better\r\ncling to her religion. It was better—she hardly noticed the\r\nreprehensibleness of her thought—than nothing. But oh, she wanted to\r\ncling to something tangible, to love something living, something that\r\none could hold against one’s heart, that one could see and touch and do\r\nthings for. If her poor baby hadn’t died . . . babies didn’t get bored\r\nwith one, it took them a long while to grow up and find one out. And\r\nperhaps one’s baby never did find one out; perhaps one would always be\r\nto it, however old and bearded it grew, somebody special, somebody\r\ndifferent from every one else, and if for no other reason, precious in\r\nthat one could never be repeated.\r\n\r\nSitting with dim eyes looking out to sea she felt an extraordinary\r\nyearning to hold something of her very own tight to her bosom. Rose was\r\nslender, and as reserved in figure as in character, yet she felt a\r\nqueer sensation of—how could she describe it?—bosom. There was\r\nsomething about San Salvatore that made her feel all bosom. She wanted\r\nto gather to her bosom, to comfort and protect, soothing the dear head\r\nthat should lie on it with softest strokings and murmurs of love.\r\nFrederick, Frederick’s child—come to her, pillowed on her, because they\r\nwere unhappy, because they had been hurt. . . They would need her then,\r\nif they had been hurt; they would let themselves be loved then, if they\r\nwere unhappy.\r\n\r\nWell, the child was gone, would never come now; but perhaps\r\nFrederick—some day—when he was old and tired . . .\r\n\r\nSuch were Mrs. Arbuthnot’s reflections and emotions that first day at\r\nSan Salvatore by herself. She went back to tea dejected as she had not\r\nbeen for years. San Salvatore had taken her carefully built-up\r\nsemblance of happiness away from her, and given her nothing in\r\nexchange. Yes—it had given her yearnings in exchange, this ache and\r\nlonging, this queer feeling of bosom; but that was worse than nothing.\r\nAnd she who had learned balance, who never at home was irritated but\r\nalways able to be kind, could not, even in her dejection, that\r\nafternoon endure Mrs. Fisher’s assumption of the position as hostess at\r\ntea.\r\n\r\nOne would have supposed that such a little thing would not have touched\r\nher, but it did. Was her nature changing? Was she to be not only thrown\r\nback on long-stifled yearnings after Frederick, but also turned into\r\nsomebody who wanted to fight over little things? After tea, when both\r\nMrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline had disappeared again—it was quite\r\nevident that nobody wanted her—she was more dejected than ever,\r\noverwhelmed by the discrepancy between the splendour outside her, the\r\nwarm, teeming beauty and self-sufficiency of nature, and the blank\r\nemptiness of her heart.\r\n\r\nThen came Lotty, back to dinner, incredibly more freckled, exuding the\r\nsunshine she had been collecting all day, talking, laughing, being\r\ntactless, being unwise, being without reticence; and Lady Caroline, so\r\nquiet at tea, woke up to animation, and Mrs. Fisher was not so\r\nnoticeable, and Rose was beginning to revive a little, for Lotty’s\r\nspirits were contagious as she described the delights of her day, a day\r\nwhich might easily to any one else have had nothing in it but a very\r\nlong and very hot walk and sandwiches, when she suddenly said catching\r\nRose’s eye, “Letter gone?”\r\n\r\nRose flushed. This tactlessness . . .\r\n\r\n“What letter?” asked Scrap, interested. Both her elbows were on the\r\ntable and her chin was supported in her hands, for the nut-stage had\r\nbeen reached, and there was nothing for it but to wait in as\r\ncomfortable as position as possible till Mrs. Fisher had finished\r\ncracking.\r\n\r\n“Asking her husband here,” said Lotty.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher looked up. Another husband? Was there to be no end to them?\r\nNor was this one, then, a widow either; but her husband was no doubt a\r\ndecent, respectable man, following a decent, respectable calling. She\r\nhad little hope of Mr. Wilkins; so little, that she had refrained from\r\ninquiring what he did.\r\n\r\n“Has it?” persisted Lotty, as Rose said nothing.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Rose.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well—to-morrow then,” said Lotty.\r\n\r\nRose wanted to say No again to this. Lotty would have in her place, and\r\nwould, besides, have expounded all her reasons. But she could not turn\r\nherself inside out like that and invite any and everybody to come and\r\nlook. How was it that Lotty, who saw so many things, didn’t see stuck\r\non her heart, and seeing keep quiet about it, the sore place that was\r\nFrederick?\r\n\r\n“Who is your husband?” asked Mrs. Fisher, carefully adjusting another\r\nnut between the crackers.\r\n\r\n“Who should he be,” said Rose quickly, roused at once by Mrs. Fisher to\r\nirritation, “except _Mr._ Arbuthnot?”\r\n\r\n“I mean, of course, what is Mr. Arbuthnot?”\r\n\r\nAnd Rose, gone painfully red at this, said after a tiny pause, “My\r\nhusband.”\r\n\r\nNaturally, Mrs. Fisher was incensed. She couldn’t have believed it of\r\nthis one, with her decent hair and gentle voice, that she too should be\r\nimpertinent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\n\r\nThat first week the wistaria began to fade, and the flowers of the\r\nJudas-tree and peach-trees fell off and carpeted the ground with\r\nrose-colour. Then all the freesias disappeared, and the irises grew\r\nscarce. And then, while these were clearing themselves away, the double\r\nbanksia roses came out, and the big summer roses suddenly flaunted\r\ngorgeously on the walls and trellises. Fortune’s Yellow was one of\r\nthem; a very beautiful rose. Presently the tamarisk and the daphnes\r\nwere at their best, and the lilies at their tallest. By the end of the\r\nweek the fig-trees were giving shade, the plum-blossom was out among\r\nthe olives, the modest weigelias appeared in their fresh pink clothes,\r\nand on the rocks sprawled masses of thick-leaved, star-shaped flowers,\r\nsome vivid purple and some a clear, pale lemon.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the week, too, Mr. Wilkins arrived; even as his wife had\r\nforeseen he would, so he did. And there were signs almost of eagerness\r\nabout his acceptance of her suggestion, for he had not waited to write\r\na letter in answer to hers, but had telegraphed.\r\n\r\nThat, surely, was eager. It showed, Scrap thought, a definite wish for\r\nreunion; and watching his wife’s happy face, and aware of her desire\r\nthat Mellersh should enjoy his holiday, she told herself that he would\r\nbe a very unusual fool should he waste his time bothering about anybody\r\nelse. “If he isn’t nice to her,” Scrap thought, “he shall be taken to\r\nthe battlements and tipped over.” For, by the end of the week, she and\r\nMrs. Wilkins had become Caroline and Lotty to each other, and were\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins had always been friends, but Scrap had struggled not to\r\nbe. She had tried hard to be cautious, but how difficult was caution\r\nwith Mrs. Wilkins! Free herself from every vestige of it, she was so\r\nentirely unreserved, so completely expansive, that soon Scrap, almost\r\nbefore she knew what she was doing, was being unreserved too. And\r\nnobody could be more unreserved than Scrap, once she let herself go.\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty about Lotty was that she was nearly always\r\nsomewhere else. You couldn’t catch her; you couldn’t pin her down to\r\ncome and talk. Scrap’s fears that she would grab seemed grotesque in\r\nretrospect. Why, there was no grab in her. At dinner and after dinner\r\nwere the only times one really saw her. All day long she was invisible,\r\nand would come back in the late afternoon looking a perfect sight, her\r\nhair full of bits of moss, and her freckles worse than ever. Perhaps\r\nshe was making the most of her time before Mellersh arrived to do all\r\nthe things she wanted to do, and meant to devote herself afterwards to\r\ngoing about with him, tidy and in her best clothes.\r\n\r\nScrap watched her, interested in spite of herself, because it seemed so\r\nextraordinary to be as happy as all that on so little. San Salvatore\r\nwas beautiful, and the weather was divine; but scenery and weather had\r\nnever been enough for Scrap, and how could they be enough for somebody\r\nwho would have to leave them quite soon and go back to life in\r\nHampstead? Also, there was the imminence of Mellersh, of that Mellersh\r\nfrom whom Lotty had so lately run. It was all very well to feel one\r\nought to share, and to make a _beau geste_ and do it, but the _beaux\r\ngestes_ Scrap had known hadn’t made anybody happy. Nobody really liked\r\nbeing the object of one, and it always meant an effort on the part of\r\nthe maker. Still, she had to admit there was no effort about Lotty; it\r\nwas quite plain that everything she did and said was effortless, and\r\nthat she was just simply, completely happy.\r\n\r\nAnd so Mrs. Wilkins was; for her doubts as to whether she had had time\r\nto become steady enough in serenity to go on being serene in Mellersh’s\r\ncompany when she had it uninterruptedly right round the clock, had gone\r\nby the middle of the week, and she felt that nothing now could shake\r\nher. She was ready for anything. She was firmly grafted, rooted, built\r\ninto heaven. Whatever Mellersh said or did, she would not budge an inch\r\nout of heaven, would not rouse herself a single instant to come outside\r\nit and be cross. On the contrary, she was going to pull him up into it\r\nbeside her, and they would sit comfortably together, suffused in light,\r\nand laugh at how much afraid of him she used to be in Hampstead, and at\r\nhow deceitful her afraidness had made her. But he wouldn’t need much\r\npulling. He would come in quite naturally after a day or two,\r\nirresistibly wafted on the scented breezes of that divine air; and\r\nthere he would sit arrayed in stars, thought Mrs. Wilkins, in whose\r\nmind, among much other _débris_, floated occasional bright shreds of\r\npoetry. She laughed to herself a little at the picture of Mellersh,\r\nthat top-hatted, black-coated, respectable family solicitor, arrayed in\r\nstars, but she laughed affectionately, almost with a maternal pride in\r\nhow splendid he would look in such fine clothes. “Poor lamb,” she\r\nmurmured to herself affectionately. And added, “What he wants is a\r\nthorough airing.”\r\n\r\nThis was during the first half of the week. By the beginning of the\r\nlast half, at the end of which Mr. Wilkins arrived, she left off even\r\nassuring herself that she was unshakeable, that she was permeated\r\nbeyond altering by the atmosphere, she no longer thought of it or\r\nnoticed it; she took it for granted. If one may say so, and she\r\ncertainly said so, not only to herself but also to Lady Caroline, she\r\nhad found her celestial legs.\r\n\r\nContrary to Mrs. Fisher’s idea of the seemly—but of course contrary;\r\nwhat else would one expect of Mrs. Wilkins?—she did not go to meet her\r\nhusband at Mezzago, but merely walked down to the point where Beppo’s\r\nfly would leave him and his luggage in the street of Castagneto. Mrs.\r\nFisher disliked the arrival of Mr. Wilkins, and was sure that anybody\r\nwho could have married Mrs. Wilkins must be at least of an injudicious\r\ndisposition, but a husband, whatever his disposition, should be\r\nproperly met. Mr. Fisher had always been properly met. Never once in\r\nhis married life had he gone unmet at a station, nor had he ever not\r\nbeen seen off. These observances, these courtesies, strengthened the\r\nbonds of marriage, and made the husband feel he could rely on his\r\nwife’s being always there. Always being there was the essential secret\r\nfor a wife. What would have become of Mr. Fisher if she had neglected\r\nto act on this principle she preferred not to think. Enough things\r\nbecame of him as it was; for whatever one’s care in stopping up,\r\nmarried life yet seemed to contain chinks.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Wilkins took no pains. She just walked down the hill\r\nsinging—Mrs. Fisher could hear her—and picked up her husband in the\r\nstreet as casually as if he were a pin. The three others, still in bed,\r\nfor it was not nearly time to get up, heard her as she passed beneath\r\ntheir windows down the zigzag path to meet Mr. Wilkins, who was coming\r\nby the morning train, and Scrap smiled, and Rose sighed, and Mrs.\r\nFisher rang her bell and desired Francesca to bring her her breakfast\r\nin her room. All three had breakfast that day in their rooms, moved by\r\na common instinct to take cover.\r\n\r\nScrap always breakfasted in bed, but she had the same instinct for\r\ncover, and during breakfast she made plans for spending the whole day\r\nwhere she was. Perhaps, though, it wouldn’t be as necessary that day as\r\nthe next. That day, Scrap calculated, Mellersh would be provided for.\r\nHe would want to have a bath, and having a bath at San Salvatore was an\r\nelaborate business, a real adventure if one had a hot one in the\r\nbathroom, and it took a lot of time. It involved the attendance of the\r\nentire staff—Domenico and the boy Giuseppe coaxing the patent stove to\r\nburn, restraining it when it burnt too fiercely, using the bellows to\r\nit when it threatened to go out, relighting it when it did go out;\r\nFrancesca anxiously hovering over the tap regulating its trickle,\r\nbecause if it were turned on too full the water instantly ran cold, and\r\nif not full enough the stove blew up inside and mysteriously flooded\r\nthe house; and Costanza and Angela running up and down bringing pails\r\nof hot water from the kitchen to eke out what the tap did.\r\n\r\nThis bath had been put in lately, and was at once the pride and the\r\nterror of the servants. It was very patent. Nobody quite understood it.\r\nThere were long printed instructions as to its right treatment hanging\r\non the wall, in which the word _pericoloso_ recurred. When Mrs. Fisher,\r\nproceeding on her arrival to the bathroom, saw this word, she went back\r\nto her room again and ordered a sponge-bath instead; and when the\r\nothers found what using the bathroom meant, and how reluctant the\r\nservants were to leave them alone with the stove, and how Francesca\r\npositively refused to, and stayed with her back turned watching the\r\ntap, and how the remaining servants waited anxiously outside the door\r\ntill the bather came safely out again, they too had sponge-baths\r\nbrought into their rooms instead.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins, however, was a man, and would be sure to want a big bath.\r\nHaving it, Scrap calculated, would keep him busy for a long while. Then\r\nhe would unpack, and then, after his night in the train, he would\r\nprobably sleep till the evening. So would he be provided for the whole\r\nof that day, and not be let loose on them till dinner.\r\n\r\nTherefore Scrap came to the conclusion she would be quite safe in the\r\ngarden that day, and got up as usual after breakfast, and dawdled as\r\nusual through her dressing, listening with a slightly cocked ear to\r\nthe sounds of Mr. Wilkins’s arrival, of his luggage being carried into\r\nLotty’s room on the other side of the landing, of his educated voice\r\nas he inquired of Lotty, first, “Do I give this fellow anything?” and\r\nimmediately afterwards, “Can I have a hot bath?”—of Lotty’s voice\r\ncheerfully assuring him that he needn’t give the fellow anything\r\nbecause he was the gardener, and that yes, he could have a hot bath;\r\nand soon after this the landing was filled with the familiar noises of\r\nwood being brought, of water being brought, of feet running, of tongues\r\nvociferating—in fact, with the preparation of the bath.\r\n\r\nScrap finished dressing, and then loitered at her window, waiting till\r\nshe should hear Mr. Wilkins go into the bathroom. When he was safely\r\nthere she would slip out and settle herself in her garden and resume\r\nher inquiries into the probable meaning of her life. She was getting on\r\nwith her inquiries. She dozed much less frequently, and was beginning\r\nto be inclined to agree that tawdry was the word to apply to her past.\r\nAlso she was afraid that her future looked black.\r\n\r\nThere—she could hear Mr. Wilkins’s educated voice again. Lotty’s door\r\nhad opened, and he was coming out of it asking his way to the bathroom.\r\n\r\n“It’s where you see the crowd,” Lotty’s voice answered—still a cheerful\r\nvoice, Scrap was glad to notice.\r\n\r\nHis steps went along the landing, and Lotty’s steps seemed to go\r\ndownstairs, and then there seemed to be a brief altercation at the\r\nbathroom door—hardly so much an altercation as a chorus of\r\nvociferations on one side and a wordless determination, Scrap judged, to\r\nhave a bath by oneself on the other.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins knew no Italian, and the expression _pericoloso_ left\r\nhim precisely as it found him—or would have if he had seen it, but\r\nnaturally he took no notice of the printed matter on the wall. He\r\nfirmly closed the door on the servants, resisting Domenico, who tried\r\nto the last to press through, and locked himself in as a man should for\r\nhis bath, judicially considering, as he made his simple preparations\r\nfor getting in, the singular standard of behaviour of these foreigners\r\nwho, both male and female, apparently wished to stay with him while\r\nhe bathed. In Finland, he had heard, the female natives not only\r\nwere present on such occasions but actually washed the bath-taking\r\ntraveller. He had not heard, however, that this was true too of Italy,\r\nwhich somehow seemed much nearer civilisation—perhaps because one went\r\nthere, and did not go to Finland.\r\n\r\nImpartially examining this reflection, and carefully balancing the\r\nclaims to civilisation of Italy and Finland, Mr. Wilkins got into the\r\nbath and turned off the tap. Naturally he turned off the tap. It was\r\nwhat one did. But on the instructions, printed in red letters, was a\r\nparagraph saying that the tap should not be turned off as long as there\r\nwas still fire in the stove. It should be left on—not much on, but\r\non—until the fire was quite out; otherwise, and here again was the word\r\n_pericoloso_, the stove would blow up.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins got into the bath, turned off the tap, and the stove blew\r\nup, exactly as the printed instructions said it would. It blew up,\r\nfortunately, only in its inside, but it blew up with a terrific noise,\r\nand Mr. Wilkins leapt out of the bath and rushed to the door, and only\r\nthe instinct born of years of training made him snatch up a towel as he\r\nrushed.\r\n\r\nScrap, half-way across the landing on her way out of doors, heard the\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens,” she thought, remembering the instructions, “there goes\r\nMr. Wilkins!”\r\n\r\nAnd she ran toward the head of the stairs to call the servants, and as\r\nshe ran, out ran Mr. Wilkins clutching his towel, and they ran into\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n“That damned bath!” cried Mr. Wilkins, perhaps for the only time in his\r\nlife forgetting himself; but he was upset.\r\n\r\nHere was an introduction. Mr Wilkins, imperfectly concealed in his\r\ntowel, his shoulders exposed at one end and his legs at the other, and\r\nLady Caroline Dester, to meet whom he had swallowed all his anger with\r\nhis wife and come out to Italy.\r\n\r\nFor Lotty in her letter had told him who was at San Salvatore besides\r\nherself and Mrs. Arbuthnot, and Mr. Wilkins at once had perceived that\r\nthis was an opportunity which might never recur. Lotty had merely said,\r\n“There are two other women here, Mrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline Dester,”\r\nbut that was enough. He knew all about the Droitwiches, their wealth,\r\ntheir connections, their place in history, and the power they had,\r\nshould they choose to exert it, of making yet another solicitor happy\r\nby adding him to those they already employed. Some people employed one\r\nsolicitor for one branch of their affairs, and another for another. The\r\naffairs of the Droitwiches must have many branches. He had also\r\nheard—for it was, he considered, part of his business to hear, and\r\nhaving heard to remember—of the beauty of their only daughter. Even if\r\nthe Droitwiches themselves did not need his services, their daughter\r\nmight. Beauty led one into strange situations; advice could never come\r\namiss. And should none of them, neither parents nor daughter nor any of\r\ntheir brilliant sons, need him in his professional capacity, it yet was\r\nobviously a most valuable acquaintance to make. It opened up vistas. It\r\nswelled with possibilities. He might go on living in Hampstead for\r\nyears, and not again come across such another chance.\r\n\r\nDirectly his wife’s letter reached him he telegraphed and packed. This\r\nwas business. He was not a man to lose time when it came to business;\r\nnor was he a man to jeopardise a chance by neglecting to be amiable. He\r\nmet his wife perfectly amiably, aware that amiability under such\r\ncircumstances was wisdom. Besides, he actually felt amiable—very. For\r\nonce, Lotty was really helping him. He kissed her affectionately on\r\ngetting out of Beppo’s fly, and was afraid she must have got up\r\nextremely early; he made no complaints of the steepness of the walk up;\r\nhe told her pleasantly of his journey, and when called upon, obediently\r\nadmired the views. It was all neatly mapped out in his mind, what he\r\nwas going to do that first day—have a shave, have a bath, put on clean\r\nclothes, sleep a while, and then would come lunch and the introduction\r\nto Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nIn the train he had selected the words of his greeting, going over them\r\nwith care—some slight expression of his gratification in meeting one of\r\nwhom he, in common with the whole world, had heard—but of course put\r\ndelicately, very delicately; some slight reference to her distinguished\r\nparents and the part her family had played in the history of\r\nEngland—made, of course, with proper tact; a sentence or two about her\r\neldest brother Lord Winchcombe, who had won his V.C. in the late war\r\nunder circumstances which could only cause—he might or might not add\r\nthis—every Englishman’s heart to beat higher than ever with pride, and\r\nthe first steps towards what might well be the turning-point in his\r\ncareer would have been taken.\r\n\r\nAnd here he was . . . no, it was too terrible, what could be more\r\nterrible? Only a towel on, water running off his legs, and that\r\nexclamation. He knew at once the lady was Lady Caroline—the minute the\r\nexclamation was out he knew it. Rarely did Mr. Wilkins use that word,\r\nand never, never in the presence of a lady or a client. While as for\r\nthe towel—why had he come? Why had he not stayed in Hampstead? It would\r\nbe impossible to live this down.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Wilkins was reckoning without Scrap. She, indeed, screwed up\r\nher face at the first flash of him on her astonished sight in an\r\nenormous effort not to laugh, and having choked the laughter down and\r\ngot her face serious again, she said as composedly as if he had had all\r\nhis clothes on, “How do you do.”\r\n\r\nWhat perfect tact. Mr. Wilkins could have worshipped her. This\r\nexquisite ignoring. Blue blood, of course, coming out.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed with gratitude he took her offered hand and said “How do\r\nyou do,” in his turn, and merely to repeat the ordinary words seemed\r\nmagically to restore the situation to the normal. Indeed, he was so\r\nmuch relieved, and it was so natural to be shaking hands, to be\r\nconventionally greeting, that he forgot he had only a towel on and his\r\nprofessional manner came back to him. He forgot what he was looking\r\nlike, but he did not forget that this was Lady Caroline Dester, the\r\nlady he had come all the way to Italy to see, and he did not forget\r\nthat it was in her face, her lovely and important face, that he had\r\nflung his terrible exclamation. He must at once entreat her\r\nforgiveness. To say such a word to a lady—to any lady, but of all\r\nladies to just this one . . .\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I used unpardonable language,” began Mr. Wilkins very\r\nearnestly, as earnestly and ceremoniously as if he had had his clothes\r\non.\r\n\r\n“I thought it most appropriate,” said Scrap, who was used to damns.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins was incredibly relieved and soothed by this answer. No\r\noffence, then, taken. Blue blood again. Only blue blood could afford\r\nsuch a liberal, such an understanding attitude.\r\n\r\n“It is Lady Caroline Dester, is it not, to whom I am speaking?” he\r\nasked, his voice sounding even more carefully cultivated than usual,\r\nfor he had to restrain too much pleasure, too much relief, too much of\r\nthe joy of the pardoned and the shriven from getting into it.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Scrap; and for the life of her she couldn’t help smiling.\r\nShe couldn’t help it. She hadn’t meant to smile at Mr. Wilkins, not\r\never; but really he looked—and then his voice on the top of the rest\r\nof him, oblivious of the towel and his legs, and talking just like a\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n“Allow me to introduce myself,” said Mr. Wilkins, with the ceremony of\r\nthe drawing-room. “My name is Mellersh-Wilkins.”\r\n\r\nAnd he instinctively held out his hand a second time at the words.\r\n\r\n“I thought perhaps it was,” said Scrap, a second time having hers\r\nshaken and a second time unable not to smile.\r\n\r\nHe was about to proceed to the first of the graceful tributes he had\r\nprepared in the train, oblivious, as he could not see himself, that he\r\nwas without his clothes, when the servants came running up the stairs\r\nand, simultaneously, Mrs. Fisher appeared in the doorway of her\r\nsitting-room. For all this had happened very quickly, and the servants\r\naway in the kitchen, and Mrs. Fisher pacing her battlements, had not\r\nhad time on hearing the noise to appear before the second handshake.\r\n\r\nThe servants when they heard the dreaded noise knew at once what had\r\nhappened, and rushed straight into the bathroom to try and staunch the\r\nflood, taking no notice of the figure on the landing in the towel, but\r\nMrs. Fisher did not know what the noise could be, and coming out of her\r\nroom to inquire stood rooted on the door-sill.\r\n\r\nIt was enough to root anybody. Lady Caroline shaking hands with what\r\nevidently, if he had had clothes on, would have been Mrs. Wilkins’s\r\nhusband, and both of them conversing just as if—\r\n\r\nThen Scrap became aware of Mrs. Fisher. She turned to her at once. “Do\r\nlet me,” she said gracefully, “introduce Mr. Mellersh-Wilkins. He has\r\njust come. This,” she added, turning to Mr. Wilkins, “is Mrs. Fisher.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Wilkins, nothing if not courteous, reacted at once to the\r\nconventional formula. First he bowed to the elderly lady in the\r\ndoorway, then he crossed over to her, his wet feet leaving footprints\r\nas he went, and having got to her he politely held out his hand.\r\n\r\n“It is a pleasure,” said Mr. Wilkins in his carefully modulated voice,\r\n“to meet a friend of my wife’s.”\r\n\r\nScrap melted away down into the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strange effect of this incident was that when they met that evening\r\nat dinner both Mrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline had a singular feeling of\r\nsecret understanding with Mr. Wilkins. He could not be to them as other\r\nmen. He could not be to them as he would have been if they had met him\r\nin his clothes. There was a sense of broken ice; they felt at once\r\nintimate and indulgent; almost they felt to him as nurses do—as those\r\nfeel who have assisted either patients or young children at their\r\nbaths. They were acquainted with Mr. Wilkins’s legs.\r\n\r\nWhat Mrs. Fisher said to him that morning in her first shock will never\r\nbe known, but what Mr. Wilkins said to her in reply, when reminded by\r\nwhat she was saying of his condition, was so handsome in its apology,\r\nso proper in its confusion, that she had ended by being quite sorry for\r\nhim and completely placated. After all, it was an accident, and nobody\r\ncould help accidents. And when she saw him next at dinner, dressed,\r\npolished, spotless as to linen and sleek as to hair, she felt this\r\nsingular sensation of a secret understanding with him and, added to it,\r\nof a kind of almost personal pride in his appearance, now that he was\r\ndressed, which presently extended in some subtle way to an almost\r\npersonal pride in everything he said.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt whatever in Mrs. Fisher’s mind that a man was\r\ninfinitely preferable as a companion to a woman. Mr. Wilkins’s presence\r\nand conversation at once raised the standard of the dinner-table from\r\nthat of a bear garden—yes, a bear garden—to that of a civilised social\r\ngathering. He talked as men talk, about interesting subjects, and,\r\nthough most courteous to Lady Caroline, showed no traces of dissolving\r\ninto simpers and idiocy whenever he addressed her. He was, indeed,\r\nprecisely as courteous to Mrs. Fisher herself; and when for the first\r\ntime at that table politics were introduced, he listened to her with\r\nthe proper seriousness on her exhibiting a desire to speak, and treated\r\nher opinions with the attention they deserved. He appeared to think\r\nmuch as she did about Lloyd George, and in regard to literature he was\r\nequally sound. In fact there was real conversation, and he liked nuts.\r\nHow he could have married Mrs. Wilkins was a mystery.\r\n\r\nLotty, for her part, looked on with round eyes. She had expected\r\nMellersh to take at least two days before he got to this stage, but the\r\nSan Salvatore spell had worked instantly. It was not only that he was\r\npleasant at dinner, for she had always seen him pleasant at dinners\r\nwith other people, but he had been pleasant all day privately—so\r\npleasant that he had complimented her on her looks while she was\r\nbrushing out her hair, and kissed her. Kissed her! And it was neither\r\ngood-morning nor good-night.\r\n\r\nWell, this being so, she would put off telling him the truth about her\r\nnest-egg, and about Rose not being his hostess after all, till next\r\nday. Pity to spoil things. She had been going to blurt it out as soon\r\nas he had had a rest, but it did seem a pity to disturb such a very\r\nbeautiful frame of mind as that of Mellersh this first day. Let him too\r\nget more firmly fixed in heaven. Once fixed he wouldn’t mind anything.\r\n\r\nHer face sparkled with delight at the instantaneous effect of San\r\nSalvatore. Even the catastrophe of the bath, of which she had been told\r\nwhen she came in from the garden, had not shaken him. Of course all\r\nthat he had needed was a holiday. What a brute she had been to him when\r\nhe wanted to take her himself to Italy. But this arrangement, as it\r\nhappened, was ever so much better, though not through any merit of\r\nhers. She talked and laughed gaily, not a shred of fear of him left in\r\nher, and even when she said, struck by his spotlessness, that he looked\r\nso clean that one could eat one’s dinner off him, and Scrap laughed,\r\nMellersh laughed too. He would have minded that at home, supposing that\r\nat home she had had the spirit to say it.\r\n\r\nIt was a successful evening. Scrap, whenever she looked at Mr. Wilkins,\r\nsaw him in his towel, dripping water, and felt indulgent. Mrs. Fisher\r\nwas delighted with him. Rose was a dignified hostess in Mr. Wilkins’s\r\neyes, quiet and dignified, and he admired the way she waived her right\r\nto preside at the head of the table—as a graceful compliment, of\r\ncourse, to Mrs. Fisher’s age. Mrs. Arbuthnot was, opined Mr. Wilkins,\r\nnaturally retiring. She was the most retiring of the three ladies. He\r\nhad met her before dinner alone for a moment in the drawing-room, and\r\nhad expressed in appropriate language his sense of her kindness in\r\nwishing him to join her party, and she had been retiring. Was she shy?\r\nProbably. She had blushed, and murmured as if in deprecation, and then\r\nthe others had come in. At dinner she talked least. He would, of\r\ncourse, become better acquainted with her during the next few days, and\r\nit would be a pleasure, he was sure.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lady Caroline was all and more than all Mr. Wilkins had\r\nimagined, and had received his speeches, worked in skilfully between\r\nthe courses, graciously; Mrs. Fisher was the exact old lady he had been\r\nhoping to come across all his professional life; and Lotty had not only\r\nimmensely improved, but was obviously _au mieux_—Mr. Wilkins knew what\r\nwas necessary in French—with Lady Caroline. He had been much tormented\r\nduring the day by the thought of how he had stood conversing with Lady\r\nCaroline forgetful of his not being dressed, and had at last written\r\nher a note most deeply apologising, and beseeching her to overlook his\r\namazing, his incomprehensible obliviousness, to which she had replied\r\nin pencil on the back of the envelope, “Don’t worry.” And he had obeyed\r\nher commands, and had put it from him. The result was he was now in\r\ngreat contentment. Before going to sleep that night he pinched his\r\nwife’s ear. She was amazed. These endearments . . .\r\n\r\nWhat is more, the morning brought no relapse in Mr. Wilkins, and he\r\nkept up to this high level throughout the day, in spite of its being\r\nthe first day of the second week, and therefore pay day.\r\n\r\nIts being pay day precipitated Lotty’s confession, which she had, when\r\nit came to the point, been inclined to put off a little longer. She was\r\nnot afraid, she dared anything, but Mellersh was in such an admirable\r\nhumour—why risk clouding it just yet? When, however, soon after\r\nbreakfast Costanza appeared with a pile of very dirty little bits of\r\npaper covered with sums in pencil, and having knocked at Mrs. Fisher’s\r\ndoor and been sent away, and at Lady Caroline’s door and been sent\r\naway, and at Rose’s door and had no answer because Rose had gone out,\r\nshe waylaid Lotty, who was showing Mellersh over the house, and pointed\r\nto the bits of paper and talked very rapidly and loud, and shrugged her\r\nshoulders a great deal, and kept on pointing at the bits of paper,\r\nLotty remembered that a week had passed without anybody paying anything\r\nto anyone, and that the moment had come to settle up.\r\n\r\n“Does this good lady want something?” inquired Mr. Wilkins\r\nmellifluously.\r\n\r\n“Money,” said Lotty.\r\n\r\n“Money?”\r\n\r\n“It’s the housekeeping bills.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you have nothing to do with those,” said Mr. Wilkins serenely.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I have—”\r\n\r\nAnd the confession was precipitated.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful how Mellersh took it. One would have imagined that his\r\nsole idea about the nest-egg had always been that it should be lavished\r\non just this. He did not, as he would have done at home, cross-examine\r\nher; he accepted everything as it came pouring out, about her fibs and\r\nall, and when she had finished and said, “You have every right to be\r\nangry, I think, but I hope you won’t be and will forgive me instead,”\r\nhe merely asked, “What can be more beneficial than such a holiday?”\r\n\r\nWhereupon she put her arm through his and held it tight and said, “Oh,\r\nMellersh, you really are too sweet!”—her face red with pride in him.\r\n\r\nThat he should so quickly assimilate the atmosphere, that he should at\r\nonce become nothing but kindness, showed surely what a real affinity he\r\nhad with good and beautiful things. He belonged quite naturally in this\r\nplace of heavenly calm. He was—extraordinary how she had misjudged\r\nhim—by nature a child of light. Fancy not minding the dreadful fibs she\r\nhad gone in for before leaving home; fancy passing even those over\r\nwithout comment. Wonderful. Yet not wonderful, for wasn’t he in heaven?\r\nIn heaven nobody minded any of those done-with things, one didn’t even\r\ntrouble to forgive and forget, one was much too happy. She pressed his\r\narm tight in her gratitude and appreciation; and though he did not\r\nwithdraw his, neither did he respond to her pressure. Mr. Wilkins was\r\nof a cool habit, and rarely had any real wish to press.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Costanza, perceiving that she had lost the Wilkinses’ ear\r\nhad gone back to Mrs. Fisher, who at least understood Italian, besides\r\nbeing clearly in the servants’ eyes the one of the party marked down by\r\nage and appearance to pay the bills; and to her, while Mrs. Fisher put\r\nthe final touches to her toilette, for she was preparing, by means of\r\nputting on a hat and veil and feather boa and gloves, to go for her\r\nfirst stroll in the lower garden—positively her first since her\r\narrival—she explained that unless she was given money to pay the last\r\nweek’s bills the shops of Castagneto would refuse credit for the\r\ncurrent week’s food. Not even credit would they give, affirmed\r\nCostanza, who had been spending a great deal and was anxious to pay all\r\nher relations what was owed them and also to find out how her\r\nmistresses took it, for that day’s meals. Soon it would be the hour of\r\n_colazione_, and how could there be _colazione_ without meat, without\r\nfish, without eggs, without—\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher took the bills out of her hand and looked at the total; and\r\nshe was so much astonished by its size, so much horrified by the\r\nextravagance to which it testified, that she sat down at her\r\nwriting-table to go into the thing thoroughly.\r\n\r\nCostanza had a very bad half-hour. She had not supposed it was in the\r\nEnglish to be so mercenary. And then _la Vecchia_, as she was called in\r\nthe kitchen, knew so much Italian, and with a doggedness that filled\r\nCostanza with shame on her behalf, for such conduct was the last one\r\nexpected from the noble English, she went through item after item,\r\nrequiring and persisting till she got them, explanations.\r\n\r\nThere were no explanations, except that Costanza had had one glorious\r\nweek of doing exactly as she chose, of splendid unbridled licence, and\r\nthat this was the result.\r\n\r\nCostanza, having no explanations, wept. It was miserable to think she\r\nwould have to cook from now on under watchfulness, under suspicion; and\r\nwhat would her relations say when they found the orders they received\r\nwere whittled down? They would say she had no influence; they would\r\ndespise her.\r\n\r\nCostanza wept, but Mrs. Fisher was unmoved. In slow and splendid\r\nItalian, with the roll of the cantos of the _Inferno_, she informed her\r\nthat she would pay no bills till the following week, and that meanwhile\r\nthe food was to be precisely as good as ever, and at a quarter the\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nCostanza threw up her hands.\r\n\r\nNext week, proceeded Mrs. Fisher unmoved, if she found this had been so\r\nshe would pay the whole. Otherwise—she paused; for what she would do\r\notherwise she did not know herself. But she paused and looked\r\nimpenetrable, majestic and menacing, and Costanza was cowed.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Fisher, having dismissed her with a gesture, went in search\r\nof Lady Caroline to complain. She had been under the impression that\r\nLady Caroline ordered the meals and therefore was responsible for the\r\nprices, but now it appeared that the cook had been left to do exactly\r\nas she pleased ever since they got there, which of course was simply\r\ndisgraceful.\r\n\r\nScrap was not in her bedroom, but the room, on Mrs. Fisher’s opening\r\nthe door, for she suspected her of being in it and only pretending not\r\nto hear the knock, was still flowerlike from her presence.\r\n\r\n“Scent,” sniffed Mrs. Fisher, shutting it again; and she wished Carlyle\r\ncould have had five minutes’ straight talk with this young woman. And\r\nyet—perhaps even he—\r\n\r\nShe went downstairs to go into the garden in search of her, and in the\r\nhall encountered Mr. Wilkins. He had his hat on, and was lighting a\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\nIndulgent as Mrs. Fisher felt towards Mr. Wilkins, and peculiarly and\r\neven mystically related after the previous morning’s encounter, she yet\r\ncould not like a cigar in the house. Out of doors she endured it, but\r\nit was not necessary, when out of doors was such a big place, to\r\nindulge the habit indoors. Even Mr. Fisher, who had been, she should\r\nsay, a man originally tenacious of habits, had quite soon after\r\nmarriage got out of this one.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Wilkins, snatching off his hat on seeing her, instantly\r\nthrew the cigar away. He threw it into the water a great jar of arum\r\nlilies presumably contained, and Mrs. Fisher, aware of the value men\r\nattach to their newly-lit cigars, could not but be impressed by this\r\nimmediate and magnificent _amende honorable_.\r\n\r\nBut the cigar did not reach the water. It got caught in the lilies, and\r\nsmoked on by itself among them, a strange and depraved-looking object.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going to, my prett—” began Mr. Wilkins, advancing\r\ntowards Mrs. Fisher; but he broke off just in time.\r\n\r\nWas it morning spirits impelling him to address Mrs. Fisher in the\r\nterms of a nursery rhyme? He wasn’t even aware that he knew the thing.\r\nMost strange. What could have put it, at such a moment, into his\r\nself-possessed head? He felt great respect for Mrs. Fisher, and would\r\nnot for the world have insulted her by addressing her as a maid, pretty\r\nor otherwise. He wished to stand well with her. She was a woman of\r\nparts, and also, he suspected, of property. At breakfast they had been\r\nmost pleasant together, and he had been struck by her apparent intimacy\r\nwith well-known persons. Victorians, of course; but it was restful to\r\ntalk about them after the strain of his brother-in-law’s Georgian\r\nparties on Hampstead Heath. He and she were getting on famously, he\r\nfelt. She already showed all the symptoms of presently wishing to\r\nbecome a client. Not for the world would he offend her. He turned a\r\nlittle cold at the narrowness of his escape.\r\n\r\nShe had not, however, noticed.\r\n\r\n“You are going out,” he said very politely, all readiness should she\r\nconfirm his assumption to accompany her.\r\n\r\n“I want to find Lady Caroline,” said Mrs. Fisher, going towards the\r\nglass door leading into the top garden.\r\n\r\n“An agreeable quest,” remarked Mr. Wilkins. “May I assist in the\r\nsearch? Allow me—” he added, opening the door for her.\r\n\r\n“She usually sits over in that corner behind the bushes,” said Mrs.\r\nFisher. “And I don’t know about it being an agreeable quest. She has\r\nbeen letting the bills run up in the most terrible fashion, and needs a\r\ngood scolding.”\r\n\r\n“Lady Caroline?” said Mr. Wilkins, unable to follow such an attitude.\r\n“What has Lady Caroline, if I may inquire, to do with the bills here?”\r\n\r\n“The housekeeping was left to her, and as we all share alike it ought\r\nto have been a matter of honour with her—”\r\n\r\n“But—Lady Caroline housekeeping for the party here? A party which\r\nincludes my wife? My dear lady, you render me speechless. Do you not\r\nknow she is the daughter of the Droitwiches?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, is that who she is,” said Mrs. Fisher, scrunching heavily over the\r\npebbles towards the hidden corner. “Well, that accounts for it. The\r\nmuddle that man Droitwich made in his department in the war was a\r\nnational scandal. It amounted to misappropriation of the public funds.”\r\n\r\n“But it is impossible, I assure you, to expect the daughter of the\r\nDroitwiches—” began Mr. Wilkins earnestly.\r\n\r\n“The Droitwiches,” interrupted Mrs. Fisher, “are neither here nor\r\nthere. Duties undertaken should be performed. I don’t intend my money\r\nto be squandered for the sake of any Droitwiches.”\r\n\r\nA headstrong old lady. Perhaps not so easy to deal with as he had\r\nhoped. But how wealthy. Only the consciousness of great wealth would\r\nmake her snap her fingers in this manner at the Droitwiches. Lotty, on\r\nbeing questioned, had been vague about her circumstances, and had\r\ndescribed her house as a mausoleum with gold-fish swimming about in it;\r\nbut now he was sure she was more than very well off. Still, he wished\r\nhe had not joined her at this moment, for he had no sort of desire to\r\nbe present at such a spectacle as the scolding of Lady Caroline Dester.\r\n\r\nAgain, however, he was reckoning without Scrap. Whatever she felt when\r\nshe looked up and beheld Mr. Wilkins discovering her corner on the very\r\nfirst morning, nothing but angelicness appeared on her face. She took\r\nher feet off the parapet on Mrs. Fisher’s sitting down on it, and\r\nlistening gravely to her opening remarks as to her not having any money\r\nto fling about in reckless and uncontrolled household expenditure,\r\ninterrupted her flow by pulling one of the cushions from behind her\r\nhead and offering it to her.\r\n\r\n“Sit on this,” said Scrap, holding it out. “You’ll be more\r\ncomfortable.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins leapt to relieve her of it.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thanks,” said Mrs. Fisher, interrupted.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to get into the swing again. Mr. Wilkins inserted the\r\ncushion solicitously between the slightly raised Mrs. Fisher and the\r\nstone of the parapet, and again she had to say “Thanks.” It was\r\ninterrupted. Besides, Lady Caroline said nothing in her defence; she\r\nonly looked at her, and listened with the face of an attentive angel.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Mr. Wilkins that it must be difficult to scold a Dester\r\nwho looked like that and so exquisitely said nothing. Mrs. Fisher, he\r\nwas glad to see, gradually found it difficult herself, for her severity\r\nslackened, and she ended by saying lamely, “You ought to have told me\r\nyou were not doing it.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know you thought I was,” said the lovely voice.\r\n\r\n“I would now like to know,” said Mrs. Fisher, “what you propose to do\r\nfor the rest of the time here.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” said Scrap, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Nothing? Do you mean to say—”\r\n\r\n“If I may be allowed, ladies,” interposed Mr. Wilkins in his suavest\r\nprofessional manner, “to make a suggestion”—they both looked at him,\r\nand remembering him as they first saw him felt indulgent—“I would\r\nadvise you not to spoil a delightful holiday with worries over\r\nhousekeeping.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Mrs. Fisher. “It is what I intend to avoid.”\r\n\r\n“Most sensible,” said Mr. Wilkins. “Why not, then,” he continued,\r\n“allow the cook—an excellent cook, by the way—so much a head _per\r\ndiem_”—Mr. Wilkins knew what was necessary in Latin—“and tell her that\r\nfor this sum she must cater for you, and not only cater but cater as\r\nwell as ever? One could easily reckon it out. The charges of a moderate\r\nhotel, for instance, would do as a basis, halved, or perhaps even\r\nquartered.”\r\n\r\n“And this week that has just passed?” asked Mrs. Fisher. “The terrible\r\nbills of this first week? What about them?”\r\n\r\n“They shall be my present to San Salvatore,” said Scrap, who didn’t\r\nlike the idea of Lotty’s nest-egg being reduced so much beyond what she\r\nwas prepared for.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. The ground was cut from under Mrs. Fisher’s feet.\r\n\r\n“Of course if you choose to throw your money about—” she said at last,\r\ndisapproving but immensely relieved, while Mr. Wilkins was rapt in the\r\ncontemplation of the precious qualities of blue blood. This readiness,\r\nfor instance, not to trouble about money, this free-handedness—it was\r\nnot only what one admired in others, admired in others perhaps more\r\nthan anything else, but it was extraordinarily useful to the\r\nprofessional classes. When met with it should be encouraged by warmth\r\nof reception. Mrs. Fisher was not warm. She accepted—from which he\r\ndeduced that with her wealth went closeness—but she accepted\r\ngrudgingly. Presents were presents, and one did not look them in this\r\nmanner in the mouth, he felt; and if Lady Caroline found her pleasure\r\nin presenting his wife and Mrs. Fisher with their entire food for a\r\nweek, it was their part to accept gracefully. One should not discourage\r\ngifts.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of his wife, then, Mr. Wilkins expressed what she would wish\r\nto express, and remarking to Lady Caroline—with a touch of lightness,\r\nfor so should gifts be accepted in order to avoid embarrassing the\r\ndonor—that she had in that case been his wife’s hostess since her\r\narrival, he turned almost gaily to Mrs. Fisher and pointed out that she\r\nand his wife must now jointly write Lady Caroline the customary letter\r\nof thanks for hospitality. “A Collins,” said Mr. Wilkins, who knew what\r\nwas necessary in literature. “I prefer the name Collins for such a\r\nletter to either that of Board and Lodging or Bread and Butter. Let us\r\ncall it a Collins.”\r\n\r\nScrap smiled, and held out her cigarette case. Mrs. Fisher could not\r\nhelp being mollified. A way out of waste was going to be found, thanks\r\nto Mr. Wilkins, and she hated waste quite as much as having to pay for\r\nit; also a way was found out of housekeeping. For a moment she had\r\nthought that if everybody tried to force her into housekeeping on her\r\nbrief holiday by their own indifference (Lady Caroline), or inability\r\nto speak Italian (the other two), she would have to send for Kate\r\nLumley after all. Kate could do it. Kate and she had learnt Italian\r\ntogether. Kate would only be allowed to come on condition that she did\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nBut this was much better, this way of Mr. Wilkins’s. Really a most\r\nsuperior man. There was nothing like an intelligent, not too young man\r\nfor profitable and pleasurable companionship. And when she got up, the\r\nbusiness for which she had come being settled, and said she now\r\nintended to take a little stroll before lunch, Mr. Wilkins did not stay\r\nwith Lady Caroline, as most of the men she had known would, she was\r\nafraid, have wanted to—he asked to be permitted to go and stroll with\r\nher; so that he evidently definitely preferred conversation to faces. A\r\nsensible, companionable man. A clever, well-read man. A man of the\r\nworld. A man. She was very glad indeed she had not written to Kate the\r\nother day. What did she want with Kate? She had found a better\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Wilkins did not go with Mrs. Fisher because of her\r\nconversation, but because, when she got up and he got up because she\r\ngot up, intending merely to bow her out of the recess, Lady Caroline\r\nhad put her feet up on the parapet again, and arranging her head\r\nsideways in the cushions had shut her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of the Droitwiches desired to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was not for him, by remaining, to prevent her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so the second week began, and all was harmony. The arrival of Mr.\r\nWilkins, instead of, as three of the party had feared and the fourth\r\nhad only been protected from fearing by her burning faith in the effect\r\non him of San Salvatore, disturbing such harmony as there was,\r\nincreased it. He fitted in. He was determined to please, and he did\r\nplease. He was most amiable to his wife—not only in public, which she\r\nwas used to, but in private, when he certainly wouldn’t have been if he\r\nhadn’t wanted to. He did want to. He was so much obliged to her, so\r\nmuch pleased with her, for making him acquainted with Lady Caroline,\r\nthat he felt really fond of her. Also proud; for there must be, he\r\nreflected, a good deal more in her than he had supposed, for Lady\r\nCaroline to have become so intimate with her and so affectionate. And\r\nthe more he treated her as though she were really very nice, the more\r\nLotty expanded and became really very nice, and the more he, affected\r\nin his turn, became really very nice himself; so that they went round\r\nand round, not in a vicious but in a highly virtuous circle.\r\n\r\nPositively, for him, Mellersh petted her. There was at no time much pet\r\nin Mellersh, because he was by nature a cool man; yet such was the\r\ninfluence on him of, as Lotty supposed, San Salvatore, that in this\r\nsecond week he sometimes pinched both her ears, one after the other,\r\ninstead of only one; and Lotty, marvelling at such rapidly developing\r\naffectionateness, wondered what he would do, should he continue at this\r\nrate, in the third week, when her supply of ears would have come to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nHe was particularly nice about the washstand, and genuinely desirous of\r\nnot taking up too much of the space in the small bedroom. Quick to\r\nrespond, Lotty was even more desirous not to be in his way; and the\r\nroom became the scene of many an affectionate _combat de générosité_,\r\neach of which left them more pleased with each other than ever. He did\r\nnot again have a bath in the bathroom, though it was mended and ready\r\nfor him, but got up and went down every morning to the sea, and in\r\nspite of the cool nights making the water cold early had his dip as a\r\nman should, and came up to breakfast rubbing his hands and feeling, as\r\nhe told Mrs. Fisher, prepared for anything.\r\n\r\nLotty’s belief in the irresistible influence of the heavenly atmosphere\r\nof San Salvatore being thus obviously justified, and Mr. Wilkins, whom\r\nRose knew as alarming and Scrap had pictured as icily unkind, being so\r\nevidently a changed man, both Rose and Scrap began to think there might\r\nafter all be something in what Lotty insisted on, and that San\r\nSalvatore did work purgingly on the character.\r\n\r\nThey were the more inclined to think so in that they too felt a working\r\ngoing on inside themselves: they felt more cleared, both of them, that\r\nsecond week—Scrap in her thoughts, many of which were now quite nice\r\nthoughts, real amiable ones about her parents and relations, with a\r\nglimmer in them of recognition of the extraordinary benefits she had\r\nreceived at the hands of—what? Fate? Providence?—anyhow of something,\r\nand of how, having received them, she had misused them by failing to be\r\nhappy; and Rose in her bosom, which though it still yearned, yearned to\r\nsome purpose, for she was reaching the conclusion that merely\r\ninactively to yearn was no use at all, and that she must either by some\r\nmeans stop her yearning or give it at least a chance—remote, but still\r\na chance—of being quieted by writing to Frederick and asking him to\r\ncome out.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Wilkins could be changed, thought Rose, why not Frederick? How\r\nwonderful it would be, how too wonderful, if the place worked on him\r\ntoo and were able to make them even a little understand each other,\r\neven a little be friends. Rose, so far had loosening and disintegration\r\ngone on in her character, now was beginning to think her obstinate\r\nstrait-lacedness about his books and her austere absorption in good\r\nworks had been foolish and perhaps even wrong. He was her husband, and\r\nshe had frightened him away. She had frightened love away, precious\r\nlove, and that couldn’t be good. Was not Lotty right when she said the\r\nother day that nothing at all except love mattered? Nothing certainly\r\nseemed much use unless it was built up on love. But once frightened\r\naway, could it ever come back? Yes, it might in that beauty, it might\r\nin the atmosphere of happiness Lotty and San Salvatore seemed between\r\nthem to spread round like some divine infection.\r\n\r\nShe had, however, to get him there first, and he certainly couldn’t be\r\ngot there if she didn’t write and tell him where she was.\r\n\r\nShe would write. She must write; for if she did there was at least a\r\nchance of his coming, and if she didn’t there was manifestly none. And\r\nthen, once here in this loveliness, with everything so soft and kind\r\nand sweet all round, it would be easier to tell him, to try and\r\nexplain, to ask for something different, for at least an attempt at\r\nsomething different in their lives in the future, instead of the\r\nblankness of separation, the cold—oh, the cold—of nothing at all but\r\nthe great windiness of faith, the great bleakness of works. Why, one\r\nperson in the world, one single person belonging to one, of one’s very\r\nown, to talk to, to take care of, to love, to be interested in, was\r\nworth more than all the speeches on platforms and the compliments of\r\nchairmen in the world. It was also worth more—Rose couldn’t help it,\r\nthe thought would come—than all the prayers.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were not head thoughts, like Scrap’s, who was altogether\r\nfree from yearnings, but bosom thoughts. They lodged in the bosom; it\r\nwas in the bosom that Rose ached, and felt so dreadfully lonely. And\r\nwhen her courage failed her, as it did on most days, and it seemed\r\nimpossible to write to Frederick, she would look at Mr. Wilkins and\r\nrevive.\r\n\r\nThere he was, a changed man. There he was, going into that small,\r\nuncomfortable room every night, that room whose proximities had been\r\nLotty’s only misgiving, and coming out of it in the morning, and Lotty\r\ncoming out of it too, both of them as unclouded and as nice to each\r\nother as when they went in. And hadn’t he, so critical at home, Lotty\r\nhad told her, of the least thing going wrong, emerged from the bath\r\ncatastrophe as untouched in spirit as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego\r\nwere untouched in body when they emerged from the fire? Miracles were\r\nhappening in this place. If they could happen to Mr. Wilkins, why not\r\nto Frederick?\r\n\r\nShe got up quickly. Yes, she would write. She would go and write to him\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nBut suppose—\r\n\r\nShe paused. Suppose he didn’t answer. Suppose he didn’t even answer.\r\n\r\nAnd she sat down again to think a little longer.\r\n\r\nIn these hesitations did Rose spend most of the second week.\r\n\r\nThen there was Mrs. Fisher. Her restlessness increased that second\r\nweek. It increased to such an extent that she might just as well not\r\nhave had her private sitting-room at all, for she could no longer sit.\r\nNot for ten minutes together could Mrs. Fisher sit. And added to the\r\nrestlessness, as the days of the second week proceeded on their way,\r\nshe had a curious sensation, which worried her, of rising sap. She knew\r\nthe feeling, because she had sometimes had it in childhood in specially\r\nswift springs, when the lilacs and the syringas seemed to rush out into\r\nblossom in a single night, but it was strange to have it again after\r\nover fifty years. She would have liked to remark on the sensation to\r\nsome one, but she was ashamed. It was such an absurd sensation at her\r\nage. Yet oftener and oftener, and every day more and more, did Mrs.\r\nFisher have a ridiculous feeling as if she were presently going to\r\nburgeon.\r\n\r\nSternly she tried to frown the unseemly sensation down. Burgeon,\r\nindeed. She had heard of dried staffs, pieces of mere dead wood,\r\nsuddenly putting forth fresh leaves, but only in legend. She was not in\r\nlegend. She knew perfectly what was due to herself. Dignity demanded\r\nthat she should have nothing to do with fresh leaves at her age; and\r\nyet there it was—the feeling that presently, that at any moment now,\r\nshe might crop out all green.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher was upset. There were many things she disliked more than\r\nanything else, and one was when the elderly imagined they felt young\r\nand behaved accordingly. Of course they only imagined it, they were\r\nonly deceiving themselves; but how deplorable were the results. She\r\nherself had grown old as people should grow old—steadily and firmly. No\r\ninterruptions, no belated after-glows and spasmodic returns. If, after\r\nall these years, she were now going to be deluded into some sort of\r\nunsuitable breaking-out, how humiliating.\r\n\r\nIndeed she was thankful, that second week, that Kate Lumley was not\r\nthere. It would be most unpleasant, should anything different occur in\r\nher behaviour, to have Kate looking on. Kate had known her all her\r\nlife. She felt she could let herself go—here Mrs. Fisher frowned at the\r\nbook she was vainly trying to concentrate on, for where did that\r\nexpression come from?—much less painfully before strangers than before\r\nan old friend. Old friends, reflected Mrs. Fisher, who hoped she was\r\nreading, compare one constantly with what one used to be. They are\r\nalways doing it if one develops. They are surprised at development.\r\nThey hark back; they expect motionlessness after, say, fifty, to the\r\nend of one’s days.\r\n\r\nThat, thought Mrs. Fisher, her eyes going steadily line by line down\r\nthe page and not a word of it getting through into her consciousness,\r\nis foolish of friends. It is condemning one to a premature death. One\r\nshould continue (of course with dignity) to develop, however old one\r\nmay be. She had nothing against developing, against further ripeness,\r\nbecause as long as one was alive one was not dead—obviously, decided\r\nMrs. Fisher, and development, change, ripening, were life. What she\r\nwould dislike would be unripening, going back to something green. She\r\nwould dislike it intensely; and this is what she felt she was on the\r\nbrink of doing.\r\n\r\nNaturally it made her very uneasy, and only in constant movement could\r\nshe find distraction. Increasingly restless and no longer able to\r\nconfine herself to her battlements, she wandered more and more\r\nfrequently, and also aimlessly, in and out of the top garden, to the\r\ngrowing surprise of Scrap, especially when she found that all Mrs.\r\nFisher did was to stare for a few minutes at the view, pick a few dead\r\nleaves off the rose-bushes, and go away again.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Wilkins’s conversation she found temporary relief, but though he\r\njoined her whenever he could he was not always there, for he spread his\r\nattentions judiciously among the three ladies, and when he was\r\nsomewhere else she had to face and manage her thoughts as best she\r\ncould by herself. Perhaps it was the excess of light and colour at San\r\nSalvatore which made every other place seem dark and black; and Prince\r\nof Wales Terrace did seem a very dark black spot to have to go back\r\nto—a dark, narrow street, and her house dark and narrow as the street,\r\nwith nothing really living or young in it. The goldfish could hardly be\r\ncalled living, or at most not more than half living, and were certainly\r\nnot young, and except for them there were only the maids, and they were\r\ndusty old things.\r\n\r\nDusty old things. Mrs. Fisher paused in her thoughts, arrested by the\r\nstrange expression. Where had it come from? How was it possible for it\r\nto come at all? It might have been one of Mrs. Wilkins’s, in its\r\nlevity, its almost slang. Perhaps it was one of hers, and she had heard\r\nher say it and unconsciously caught it from her.\r\n\r\nIf so, this was both serious and disgusting. That the foolish creature\r\nshould penetrate into Mrs. Fisher’s very mind and establish her\r\npersonality there, the personality which was still, in spite of the\r\nharmony apparently existing between her and her intelligent husband, so\r\nalien to Mrs. Fisher’s own, so far removed from what she understood and\r\nliked, and infect her with her undesirable phrases, was most\r\ndisturbing. Never in her life before had such a sentence come into Mrs.\r\nFisher’s head. Never in her life before had she thought of her maids,\r\nor of anybody else, as dusty old things. Her maids were not dusty old\r\nthings; they were most respectable, neat women, who were allowed the\r\nuse of the bathroom every Saturday night. Elderly, certainly, but then\r\nso was she, so was her house, so was her furniture, so were her\r\ngoldfish. They were all elderly, as they should be, together. But there\r\nwas a great difference between being elderly and being a dusty old\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nHow true it was what Ruskin said, that evil communications corrupt good\r\nmanners. But did Ruskin say it? On second thoughts she was not sure,\r\nbut it was just the sort of thing he would have said if he had said it,\r\nand in any case it was true. Merely hearing Mrs. Wilkins’s evil\r\ncommunications at meals—she did not listen, she avoided listening, yet\r\nit was evident she had heard—those communications which, in that they\r\nso often were at once vulgar, indelicate and profane, and always, she\r\nwas sorry to say, laughed at by Lady Caroline, must be classed as evil,\r\nwas spoiling her own mental manners. Soon she might not only think but\r\nsay. How terrible that would be. If that were the form her breaking-out\r\nwas going to take, the form of unseemly speech, Mrs. Fisher was afraid\r\nshe would hardly with any degree of composure be able to bear it.\r\n\r\nAt this stage Mrs. Fisher wished more than ever that she were able to\r\ntalk over her strange feelings with some one who would understand.\r\nThere was, however, no one who would understand except Mrs. Wilkins\r\nherself. She would. She would know at once, Mrs. Fisher was sure, what\r\nshe felt like. But this was impossible. It would be as abject as\r\nbegging the very microbe that was infecting one for protection against\r\nits disease.\r\n\r\nShe continued, accordingly, to bear her sensations in silence, and was\r\ndriven by them into that frequent aimless appearing in the top garden\r\nwhich presently roused even Scrap’s attention.\r\n\r\nScrap had noticed it, and vaguely wondered at it, for some time before\r\nMr. Wilkins inquired of her one morning as he arranged her cushions for\r\nher—he had established the daily assisting of Lady Caroline into her\r\nchair as his special privilege—whether there was anything the matter\r\nwith Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mrs. Fisher was standing by the eastern parapet, shading\r\nher eyes and carefully scrutinising the distant white houses of\r\nMezzago. They could see her through the branches of the daphnes.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Scrap.\r\n\r\n“She is a lady, I take it,” said Mr. Wilkins, “who would be unlikely to\r\nhave anything on her mind?”\r\n\r\n“I should imagine so,” said Scrap, smiling.\r\n\r\n“If she has, and her restlessness appears to suggest it, I should be\r\nmore than glad to assist her with advice.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure you would be most kind.”\r\n\r\n“Of course she has her own legal adviser, but he is not on the spot. I\r\nam. And a lawyer on the spot,” said Mr. Wilkins, who endeavoured to\r\nmake his conversation when he talked to Lady Caroline light, aware that\r\none must be light with young ladies, “is worth two in—we won’t be\r\nordinary and complete the proverb, but say London.”\r\n\r\n“You should ask her.”\r\n\r\n“Ask her if she needs assistance? Would you advise it? Would it not be\r\na little—a little delicate to touch on such a question, the question\r\nwhether or no a lady has something on her mind?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she will tell you if you go and talk to her. I think it must\r\nbe lonely to be Mrs. Fisher.”\r\n\r\n“You are all thoughtfulness and consideration,” declared Mr. Wilkins,\r\nwishing, for the first time in his life, that he were a foreigner so\r\nthat he might respectfully kiss her hand on withdrawing to go\r\nobediently and relieve Mrs. Fisher’s loneliness.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful what a variety of exits from her corner Scrap\r\ncontrived for Mr. Wilkins. Each morning she found a different one,\r\nwhich sent him off pleased after he had arranged her cushions for her.\r\nShe allowed him to arrange the cushions because she instantly had\r\ndiscovered, the very first five minutes of the very first evening, that\r\nher fears lest he should cling to her and stare in dreadful admiration\r\nwere baseless. Mr. Wilkins did not admire like that. It was not only,\r\nshe instinctively felt, not in him, but if it had been he would not\r\nhave dared to in her case. He was all respectfulness. She could direct\r\nhis movements in regard to herself with the raising of an eyelash. His\r\none concern was to obey. She had been prepared to like him if he would\r\nonly be so obliging as not to admire her, and she did like him. She did\r\nnot forget his moving defencelessness the first morning in his towel,\r\nand he amused her, and he was kind to Lotty. It is true she liked him\r\nmost when he wasn’t there, but then she usually liked everybody most\r\nwhen they weren’t there. Certainly he did seem to be one of those men,\r\nrare in her experience, who never looked at a woman from the predatory\r\nangle. The comfort of this, the simplification it brought into the\r\nrelations of the party, was immense. From this point of view Mr.\r\nWilkins was simply ideal; he was unique and precious. Whenever she\r\nthought of him, and was perhaps inclined to dwell on the aspects of him\r\nthat were a little boring, she remembered this and murmured, “But what\r\na treasure.”\r\n\r\nIndeed it was Mr. Wilkins’s one aim during his stay at San Salvatore to\r\nbe a treasure. At all costs the three ladies who were not his wife must\r\nlike him and trust him. Then presently when trouble arose in their\r\nlives—and in what lives did not trouble sooner or later arise?—they\r\nwould recollect how reliable he was and how sympathetic, and turn to\r\nhim for advice. Ladies with something on their minds were exactly what\r\nhe wanted. Lady Caroline, he judged, had nothing on hers at the moment,\r\nbut so much beauty—for he could not but see what was evident—must have\r\nhad its difficulties in the past and would have more of them before it\r\nhad done. In the past he had not been at hand; in the future he hoped\r\nto be. And meanwhile the behaviour of Mrs. Fisher, the next in\r\nimportance of the ladies from the professional point of view, showed\r\ndefinite promise. It was almost certain that Mrs. Fisher had something\r\non her mind. He had been observing her attentively, and it was almost\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nWith the third, with Mrs. Arbuthnot, he had up to this made least\r\nheadway, for she was so very retiring and quiet. But might not this\r\nvery retiringness, this tendency to avoid the others and spend her time\r\nalone, indicate that she too was troubled? If so, he was her man. He\r\nwould cultivate her. He would follow her and sit with her, and\r\nencourage her to tell him about herself. Arbuthnot, he understood from\r\nLotty, was a British Museum official—nothing specially important at\r\npresent, but Mr. Wilkins regarded it as his business to know all sorts\r\nand kinds. Besides, there was promotion. Arbuthnot, promoted, might\r\nbecome very much worth while.\r\n\r\nAs for Lotty, she was charming. She really had all the qualities he had\r\ncredited her with during his courtship, and they had been, it appeared,\r\nmerely in abeyance since. His early impressions of her were now being\r\nendorsed by the affection and even admiration Lady Caroline showed for\r\nher. Lady Caroline Dester was the last person, he was sure, to be\r\nmistaken on such a subject. Her knowledge of the world, her constant\r\nassociation with only the best, must make her quite unerring. Lotty was\r\nevidently, then, that which before marriage he had believed her to\r\nbe—she was valuable. She certainly had been most valuable in\r\nintroducing him to Lady Caroline and Mrs. Fisher. A man in his\r\nprofession could be immensely helped by a clever and attractive wife.\r\nWhy had she not been attractive sooner? Why this sudden flowering?\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins began too to believe there was something peculiar, as Lotty\r\nhad almost at once informed him, in the atmosphere of San Salvatore. It\r\npromoted expansion. It brought out dormant qualities. And feeling more\r\nand more pleased, and even charmed, by his wife, and very content with\r\nthe progress he was making with the two others, and hopeful of progress\r\nto be made with the retiring third, Mr. Wilkins could not remember ever\r\nhaving had such an agreeable holiday. The only thing that might perhaps\r\nbe bettered was the way they would call him Mr. Wilkins. Nobody said\r\nMr. Mellersh-Wilkins. Yet he had introduced himself to Lady Caroline—he\r\nflinched a little on remembering the circumstances—as Mellersh-Wilkins.\r\n\r\nStill, this was a small matter, not enough to worry about. He would be\r\nfoolish if in such a place and such society he worried about anything.\r\nHe was not even worrying about what the holiday was costing, and had\r\nmade up his mind to pay not only his own expenses but his wife’s as\r\nwell, and surprise her at the end by presenting her with her nest-egg\r\nas intact as when she started; and just the knowledge that he was\r\npreparing a happy surprise for her made him feel warmer than ever\r\ntowards her.\r\n\r\nIn fact Mr. Wilkins, who had begun by being consciously and according\r\nto plan on his best behaviour, remained on it unconsciously, and with\r\nno effort at all.\r\n\r\nAnd meanwhile the beautiful golden days were dropping gently from the\r\nsecond week one by one, equal in beauty with those of the first, and\r\nthe scent of beanfields in flower on the hillside behind the village\r\ncame across to San Salvatore whenever the air moved. In the garden that\r\nsecond week the poet’s eyed narcissus disappeared out the long grass at\r\nthe edge of the zigzag path, and wild gladiolus, slender and\r\nrose-coloured, came in their stead, white pinks bloomed in the borders,\r\nfilling the whole place with their smoky-sweet smell, and a bush nobody\r\nhad noticed burst into glory and fragrance, and it was a purple lilac\r\nbush. Such a jumble of spring and summer was not to be believed in,\r\nexcept by those who dwelt in those gardens. Everything seemed to be out\r\ntogether—all the things crowded into one month which in England are\r\nspread penuriously over six. Even primroses were found one day by Mrs.\r\nWilkins in a cold corner up in the hills; and when she brought them\r\ndown to the geraniums and heliotrope of San Salvatore they looked quite\r\nshy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the third week Rose wrote to Frederick.\r\n\r\nIn case she should again hesitate and not post the letter, she gave it\r\nto Domenico to post; for if she did not write now there would be no\r\ntime left at all. Half the month at San Salvatore was over. Even if\r\nFrederick started directly he got the letter, which of course he\r\nwouldn’t be able to do, what with packing and passport, besides not\r\nbeing in a hurry to come, he couldn’t arrive for five days.\r\n\r\nHaving done it, Rose wished she hadn’t. He wouldn’t come. He wouldn’t\r\nbother to answer. And if he did answer, it would just be giving some\r\nreason which was not true, and about being too busy to get away; and\r\nall that had been got by writing to him would be that she would be more\r\nunhappy than before.\r\n\r\nWhat things one did when one was idle. This resurrection of Frederick,\r\nor rather this attempt to resurrect him, what was it but the result of\r\nhaving nothing whatever to do? She wished she had never come away on a\r\nholiday. What did she want with holidays? Work was her salvation; work\r\nwas the only thing that protected one, that kept one steady and one’s\r\nvalues true. At home in Hampstead, absorbed and busy, she had managed\r\nto get over Frederick, thinking of him latterly only with the gentle\r\nmelancholy with which one thinks of some one once loved but long since\r\ndead; and now this place, idleness in this soft place, had thrown her\r\nback to the wretched state she had climbed so carefully out of years\r\nago. Why, if Frederick did come she would only bore him. Hadn’t she\r\nseen in a flash quite soon after getting to San Salvatore that that was\r\nreally what kept him away from her? And why should she suppose that\r\nnow, after such a long estrangement, she would be able not to bore him,\r\nbe able to do anything but stand before him like a tongue-tied idiot,\r\nwith all the fingers of her spirit turned into thumbs? Besides, what a\r\nhopeless position, to have as it were to beseech: Please wait a\r\nlittle—please don’t be impatient—I think perhaps I shan’t be a bore\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nA thousand times a day Rose wished she had let Frederick alone. Lotty,\r\nwho asked her every evening whether she had sent her letter yet,\r\nexclaimed with delight when the answer at last was yes, and threw her\r\narms round her. “Now we shall be _completely_ happy!” cried the\r\nenthusiastic Lotty.\r\n\r\nBut nothing seemed less certain to Rose, and her expression became more\r\nand more the expression of one who has something on her mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins, wanting to find out what it was, strolled in the sun in\r\nhis Panama hat, and began to meet her accidentally.\r\n\r\n“I did not know,” said Mr. Wilkins the first time, courteously raising\r\nhis hat, “that you too liked this particular spot.” And he sat down\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon she chose another spot; and she had not been in it\r\nhalf an hour before Mr. Wilkins, lightly swinging his cane, came round\r\nthe corner.\r\n\r\n“We are destined to meet in our rambles,” said Mr. Wilkins pleasantly.\r\nAnd he sat down beside her.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins was very kind, and she had, she saw, misjudged him in\r\nHampstead, and this was the real man, ripened like fruit by the\r\nbeneficent sun of San Salvatore, but Rose did want to be alone. Still,\r\nshe was grateful to him for proving to her that though she might bore\r\nFrederick she did not bore everybody; if she had, he would not have sat\r\ntalking to her on each occasion till it was time to go in. True he\r\nbored her, but that wasn’t anything like so dreadful as if she bored\r\nhim. Then indeed her vanity would have been sadly ruffled. For now that\r\nRose was not able to say her prayers she was being assailed by every\r\nsort of weakness: vanity, sensitiveness, irritability,\r\npugnacity—strange, unfamiliar devils to have coming crowding on one and\r\ntaking possession of one’s swept and empty heart. She had never been\r\nvain or irritable or pugnacious in her life before. Could it be that\r\nSan Salvatore was capable of opposite effects, and the same sun that\r\nripened Mr. Wilkins made her go acid?\r\n\r\nThe next morning, so as to be sure of being alone, she went down, while\r\nMr. Wilkins was still lingering pleasantly with Mrs. Fisher over\r\nbreakfast, to the rocks by the water’s edge where she and Lotty had sat\r\nthe first day. Frederick by now had got her letter. To-day, if he were\r\nlike Mr. Wilkins, she might get a telegram from him.\r\n\r\nShe tried to silence the absurd hope by jeering at it. Yet—if Mr.\r\nWilkins had telegraphed, why not Frederick? The spell of San Salvatore\r\nlurked even, it seemed, in notepaper. Lotty had not dreamed of getting\r\na telegram, and when she came in at lunch-time there it was. It would\r\nbe too wonderful if when she went back at lunch-time she found one\r\nthere for her too. . .\r\n\r\nRose clasped her hands tight round her knees. How passionately she\r\nlonged to be important to somebody again—not important on platforms,\r\nnot important as an asset in an organisation, but privately important,\r\njust to one other person, quite privately, nobody else to know or\r\nnotice. It didn’t seem much to ask in a world so crowded with people,\r\njust to have one of them, only one out of all the millions, to oneself.\r\nSomebody who needed one, who thought of one, who was eager to come to\r\none—oh, _oh_ how dreadfully one wanted to be precious!\r\n\r\nAll the morning she sat beneath the pine-tree by the sea. Nobody came\r\nnear her. The great hours passed slowly; they seemed enormous. But she\r\nwouldn’t go up before lunch, she would give the telegram time to\r\narrive. . .\r\n\r\nThat day Scrap, egged on by Lotty’s persuasions and also thinking that\r\nperhaps she had sat long enough, had arisen from her chair and cushions\r\nand gone off with Lotty and sandwiches up into the hills till evening.\r\nMr. Wilkins, who wished to go with them, stayed on Lady Caroline’s\r\nadvice with Mrs. Fisher in order to cheer her solitude, and though he\r\nleft off cheering her about eleven to go and look for Mrs. Arbuthnot,\r\nso as for a space to cheer her too, thus dividing himself impartially\r\nbetween these solitary ladies, he came back again presently mopping his\r\nforehead and continued with Mrs. Fisher where he had left off, for this\r\ntime Mrs. Arbuthnot had hidden successfully. There was a telegram, too,\r\nfor her he noticed when he came in. Pity he did not know where she was.\r\n\r\n“Ought we to open it?” he said to Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n“It may require an answer.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t approve of tampering with other people’s correspondence.”\r\n\r\n“Tampering! My dear lady—”\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins was shocked. Such a word. Tampering. He had the greatest\r\npossible esteem for Mrs. Fisher, but he did at times find her a little\r\ndifficult. She liked him, he was sure, and she was in a fair way, he\r\nfelt, to become a client, but he feared she would be a headstrong and\r\nsecretive client. She was certainly secretive, for though he had been\r\nskilful and sympathetic for a whole week, she had as yet given him no\r\ninkling of what was so evidently worrying her.\r\n\r\n“Poor old thing,” said Lotty, on his asking her if she perhaps could\r\nthrow light on Mrs. Fisher’s troubles. “She hasn’t got love.”\r\n\r\n“Love?” Mr. Wilkins could only echo, genuinely scandalised. “But\r\nsurely, my dear—at her age—”\r\n\r\n“_Any_ love,” said Lotty.\r\n\r\nThat very morning he had asked his wife, for he now sought and\r\nrespected her opinion, if she could tell him what was the matter with\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot, for she too, though he had done his best to thaw her\r\ninto confidences, had remained persistently retiring.\r\n\r\n“She wants her husband,” said Lotty.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Mr. Wilkins, a new light shed on Mrs. Arbuthnot’s shy and\r\nmodest melancholy. And he added, “Very proper.”\r\n\r\nAnd Lotty said, smiling at him, “One does.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Wilkins said, smiling at her, “Does one?”\r\n\r\nAnd Lotty said, smiling at him, “Of course.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Wilkins, much pleased with her, though it was still quite early\r\nin the day, a time when caresses are sluggish, pinched her ear.\r\n\r\nJust before half-past twelve Rose came slowly up through the pergola\r\nand between the camellias ranged on either side of the old stone steps.\r\nThe rivulets of periwinkles that flowed down them when first she\r\narrived were gone, and now there were these bushes, incredibly\r\nrosetted. Pink, white, red, striped—she fingered and smelt them one\r\nafter the other, so as not to get to her disappointment too quickly. As\r\nlong as she hadn’t seen for herself, seen the table in the hall quite\r\nempty except for its bowl of flowers, she still could hope, she still\r\ncould have the joy of imagining the telegram lying on it waiting for\r\nher. But there is no smell in a camellia, as Mr. Wilkins, who was\r\nstanding in the doorway on the look-out for her and knew what was\r\nnecessary in horticulture, reminded her.\r\n\r\nShe started at his voice and looked up.\r\n\r\n“A telegram has come for you,” said Mr. Wilkins.\r\n\r\nShe stared at him, her mouth open.\r\n\r\n“I searched for you everywhere, but failed—”\r\n\r\nOf course. She knew it. She had been sure of it all the time. Bright\r\nand burning, Youth in that instant flashed down again on Rose. She flew\r\nup the steps, red as the camellia she had just been fingering, and was\r\nin the hall and tearing open the telegram before Mr. Wilkins had\r\nfinished his sentence. Why, but if things could happen like this—why,\r\nbut there was no end to—why, she and Frederick—they were going to\r\nbe—again—at last—\r\n\r\n“No bad news, I trust?” said Mr. Wilkins who had followed her, for when\r\nshe had read the telegram she stood staring at it and her face went\r\nslowly white. Curious to watch how her face went slowly white.\r\n\r\nShe turned and looked at Mr. Wilkins as if trying to remember him.\r\n\r\n“Oh no. On the contrary—”\r\n\r\nShe managed to smile. “I’m going to have a visitor,” she said, holding\r\nout the telegram; and when he had taken it she walked away towards the\r\ndining-room, murmuring something about lunch being ready.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins read the telegram. It had been sent that morning from\r\nMezzago, and was:\r\n\r\nAm passing through on way to Rome. May I pay my respects this\r\nafternoon?\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Briggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should such a telegram make the interesting lady turn pale? For her\r\npallor on reading it had been so striking as to convince Mr. Wilkins\r\nshe was receiving a blow.\r\n\r\n“Who is Thomas Briggs?” he asked, following her into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him vaguely. “Who is—?” she repeated, getting her\r\nthoughts together again.\r\n\r\n“Thomas Briggs.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Yes. He is the owner. This is his house. He is very nice. He is\r\ncoming this afternoon.”\r\n\r\nThomas Briggs was at that very moment coming. He was jogging along the\r\nroad between Mezzago and Castagneto in a fly, sincerely hoping that the\r\ndark-eyed lady would grasp that all he wanted was to see her, and not\r\nat all to see if his house were still there. He felt that an owner of\r\ndelicacy did not intrude on a tenant. But—he had been thinking so much\r\nof her since that day. Rose Arbuthnot. Such a pretty name. And such a\r\npretty creature—mild, milky, mothery in the best sense; the best sense\r\nbeing that she wasn’t his mother and couldn’t have been if she had\r\ntried, for parents were the only things impossible to have younger than\r\noneself. Also, he was passing so near. It seemed absurd not just to\r\nlook in and see if she were comfortable. He longed to see her in his\r\nhouse. He longed to see it as her background, to see her sitting in his\r\nchairs, drinking out of his cups, using all his things. Did she put the\r\nbig crimson brocade cushion in the drawing-room behind her little dark\r\nhead? Her hair and the whiteness of her skin would look lovely against\r\nit. Had she seen the portrait of herself on the stairs? He wondered if\r\nshe liked it. He would explain it to her. If she didn’t paint, and she\r\nhad said nothing to suggest it, she wouldn’t perhaps notice how exactly\r\nthe moulding of the eyebrows and the slight hollow of the cheek—\r\n\r\nHe told the fly to wait in Castagneto, and crossed the piazza, hailed\r\nby children and dogs, who all knew him and sprang up suddenly from\r\nnowhere, and walking quickly up the zigzag path, for he was an active\r\nyoung man not much more than thirty, he pulled the ancient chain that\r\nrang the bell, and waited decorously on the proper side of the open\r\ndoor to be allowed to come in.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of him Francesca flung up every bit of her that would\r\nfling up—eyebrows, eyelids, and hands, and volubly assured him that all\r\nwas in perfect order and that she was doing her duty.\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course,” said Briggs, cutting her short. “No one doubts\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nAnd he asked her to take in his card to her mistress.\r\n\r\n“Which mistress?” asked Francesca.\r\n\r\n“Which mistress?”\r\n\r\n“There are four,” said Francesca, scenting an irregularity on the part\r\nof the tenants, for her master looked surprised; and she felt pleased,\r\nfor life was dull and irregularities helped it along at least a little.\r\n\r\n“Four?” he repeated surprised. “Well, take it to the lot then,” he\r\nsaid, recovering himself, for he noticed her expression.\r\n\r\nCoffee was being drunk in the top garden in the shade of the umbrella\r\npine. Only Mrs. Fisher and Mr. Wilkins were drinking it, for Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, after eating nothing and being completely silent during\r\nlunch, had disappeared immediately afterwards.\r\n\r\nWhile Francesca went away into the garden with his card, her master\r\nstood examining the picture on the staircase of that Madonna by an\r\nearly Italian painter, name unknown, picked up by him at Orvieto, who\r\nwas so much like his tenant. It really was remarkable, the likeness. Of\r\ncourse his tenant that day in London had had her hat on, but he was\r\npretty sure her hair grew just like that off her forehead. The\r\nexpression of the eyes, grave and sweet, was exactly the same. He\r\nrejoiced to think that he would always have her portrait.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at the sound of footsteps, and there she was, coming down\r\nthe stairs just as he had imagined her in that place, dressed in white.\r\n\r\nShe was astonished to see him so soon. She had supposed he would come\r\nabout tea-time, and till then she had meant to sit somewhere out of\r\ndoors where she could be by herself.\r\n\r\nHe watched her coming down the stairs with the utmost eager interest.\r\nIn a moment she would be level with her portrait.\r\n\r\n“It really is extraordinary,” said Briggs.\r\n\r\n“How do you do,” said Rose, intent only on a decent show of welcome.\r\n\r\nShe did not welcome him. He was here, she felt, the telegram bitter in\r\nher heart, instead of Frederick, doing what she had longed Frederick\r\nwould do, taking his place.\r\n\r\n“Just stand still a moment—”\r\n\r\nShe obeyed automatically.\r\n\r\n“Yes—quite astonishing. Do you mind taking off your hat?”\r\n\r\nRose, surprised, took it off obediently.\r\n\r\n“Yes—I thought so—I just wanted to make sure. And look—have you\r\nnoticed—”\r\n\r\nHe began to make odd swift passes with his hand over the face in the\r\npicture, measuring it, looking from it to her.\r\n\r\nRose’s surprise became amusement, and she could not help smiling. “Have\r\nyou come to compare me with my original?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“You do see how extraordinarily alike—”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know I looked so solemn.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t. Not now. You did a minute ago, quite as solemn. Oh yes—how\r\ndo you do,” he finished suddenly, noticing her outstretched hand. And\r\nhe laughed and shook it, flushing—a trick of his—to the roots of his\r\nfair hair.\r\n\r\nFrancesca came back. “The Signora Fisher,” she said, “will be pleased\r\nto see him.”\r\n\r\n“Who is the Signora Fisher?” he asked Rose.\r\n\r\n“One of the four who are sharing your house.”\r\n\r\n“Then there are four of you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. My friend and I found we couldn’t afford it by ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say—” began Briggs in confusion, for he would best have liked\r\nRose Arbuthnot—pretty name—not to have to afford anything, but to stay\r\nat San Salvatore as long as she liked as his guest.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Fisher is having coffee in the top garden,” said Rose. “I’ll take\r\nyou to her and introduce you.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to go. You’ve got your hat on, so you were going for a\r\nwalk. Mayn’t I come too? I’d immensely like being shown round by you.”\r\n\r\n“But Mrs. Fisher is waiting for you.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t she keep?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Rose, with the smile that had so much attracted him the\r\nfirst day. “I think she will keep quite well till tea.”\r\n\r\n“Do you speak Italian?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Rose. “Why?”\r\n\r\nOn that he turned to Francesca, and told her at a great rate, for in\r\nItalian he was glib, to go back to the Signora in the top garden and\r\ntell her he had encountered his old friend the Signora Arbuthnot, and\r\nwas going for a walk with her and would present himself to her later.\r\n\r\n“Do you invite me to tea?” he asked Rose, when Francesca had gone.\r\n\r\n“Of course. It’s your house.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t. It’s yours.”\r\n\r\n“Till Monday week,” she smiled.\r\n\r\n“Come and show me all the views,” he said eagerly; and it was plain,\r\neven to the self-depreciatory Rose, that she did not bore Mr. Briggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 18\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had a very pleasant walk, with a great deal of sitting down in\r\nwarm, thyme-fragrant corners, and if anything could have helped Rose to\r\nrecover from the bitter disappointment of the morning it would have\r\nbeen the company and conversation of Mr. Briggs. He did help her to\r\nrecover, and the same process took place as that which Lotty had\r\nundergone with her husband, and the more Mr. Briggs thought Rose\r\ncharming the more charming she became.\r\n\r\nBriggs was a man incapable of concealments, who never lost time if he\r\ncould help it. They had not got to the end of the headland where the\r\nlighthouse is—Briggs asked her to show him the lighthouse, because the\r\npath to it, he knew, was wide enough for two to walk abreast and fairly\r\nlevel—before he had told her of the impression she had made on him in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nSince even the most religious, sober women like to know they have made\r\nan impression, particularly the kind that has nothing to do with\r\ncharacter or merits, Rose was pleased. Being pleased, she smiled.\r\nSmiling, she was more attractive than ever. Colour came into her\r\ncheeks, and brightness into her eyes. She heard herself saying things\r\nthat really sounded quite interesting and even amusing. If Frederick\r\nwere listening now, she thought, perhaps he would see that she couldn’t\r\nafter all be such a hopeless bore; for here was a man, nice-looking,\r\nyoung, and surely clever—he seemed clever, and she hoped he was, for\r\nthen the compliment would be still greater—who was evidently quite\r\nhappy to spend the afternoon just talking to her.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed Mr. Briggs seemed very much interested. He wanted to hear\r\nall about everything she had been doing from the moment she got there.\r\nHe asked her if she had seen this, that, and the other in the house,\r\nwhat she liked best, which room she had, if she were comfortable, if\r\nFrancesca was behaving, if Domenico took care of her, and whether she\r\ndidn’t enjoy using the yellow sitting-room—the one that got all the sun\r\nand looked out towards Genoa.\r\n\r\nRose was ashamed how little she had noticed in the house, and how few\r\nof the things he spoke of as curious or beautiful in it she had even\r\nseen. Swamped in thoughts of Frederick, she appeared to have lived in\r\nSan Salvatore blindly, and more than half the time had gone, and what\r\nhad been the good of it? She might just as well have been sitting\r\nhankering on Hampstead Heath. No, she mightn’t; through all her\r\nhankerings she had been conscious that she was at least in the very\r\nheart of beauty; and indeed it was this beauty, this longing to share\r\nit, that had first started her off hankering.\r\n\r\nMr. Briggs, however, was too much alive for her to be able to spare any\r\nattention at this moment for Frederick, and she praised the servants in\r\nanswer to his questions, and praised the yellow sitting-room without\r\ntelling him she had only been in it once and then was ignominiously\r\nejected, and she told him she knew hardly anything about art and\r\ncuriosities, but thought perhaps if somebody would tell her about them\r\nshe would know more, and she said she had spent every day since her\r\narrival out-of-doors, because out-of-doors there was so very wonderful\r\nand different from anything she had ever seen.\r\n\r\nBriggs walked by her side along his paths that were yet so happily for\r\nthe moment her paths, and felt all the innocent glows of family life.\r\nHe was an orphan and an only child, and had a warm, domestic\r\ndisposition. He would have adored a sister and spoilt a mother, and was\r\nbeginning at this time to think of marrying; for though he had been\r\nvery happy with his various loves, each of whom, contrary to the usual\r\nexperience, turned ultimately into his devoted friend, he was fond of\r\nchildren and thought he had perhaps now got to the age of settling if\r\nhe did not wish to be too old by the time his eldest son was twenty.\r\nSan Salvatore had latterly seemed a little forlorn. He fancied it\r\nechoed when he walked about it. He had felt lonely there; so lonely\r\nthat he had preferred this year to miss out a spring and let it. It\r\nwanted a wife in it. It wanted that final touch of warmth and beauty,\r\nfor he never thought of his wife except in terms of warmth and\r\nbeauty—she would of course be beautiful and kind. It amused him how\r\nmuch in love with this vague wife he was already.\r\n\r\nAt such a rate was he making friends with the lady with the sweet name\r\nas he walked along the path towards the lighthouse, that he was sure\r\npresently he would be telling her everything about himself and his past\r\ndoings and his future hopes; and the thought of such a swiftly\r\ndeveloping confidence made him laugh.\r\n\r\n“Why are you laughing?” she asked, looking at him and smiling.\r\n\r\n“It’s so like coming home,” he said.\r\n\r\n“But it is coming home for you to come here.”\r\n\r\n“I mean _really_ like coming home. To one’s—one’s family. I never had a\r\nfamily. I’m an orphan.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, are you?” said Rose with the proper sympathy. “I hope you’ve not\r\nbeen one very long. No—I mean I hope you have been one very long. No—I\r\ndon’t know what I mean, except that I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed again. “Oh I’m used to it. I haven’t anybody. No sisters or\r\nbrothers.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’re an only child,” she observed intelligently.\r\n\r\n“Yes. And there’s something about you that’s exactly my idea of a—of a\r\nfamily.”\r\n\r\nShe was amused.\r\n\r\n“So—cosy,” he said, looking at her and searching for a word.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t think so if you saw my house in Hampstead,” she said, a\r\nvision of that austere and hard-seated dwelling presenting itself to\r\nher mind, with nothing soft in it except the shunned and neglected Du\r\nBarri sofa. No wonder, she thought, for a moment clear-brained, that\r\nFrederick avoided it. There was nothing cosy about _his_ family.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe any place you lived in could be anything but exactly\r\nlike you,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You’re not going to pretend San Salvatore is like me?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I do pretend it. Surely you admit that it is beautiful?”\r\n\r\nHe said several things like that. She enjoyed her walk. She could not\r\nrecollect any walk so pleasant since her courting days.\r\n\r\nShe came back to tea, bringing Mr. Briggs, and looking quite different,\r\nMr. Wilkins noticed, from what she had looked till then. Trouble here,\r\ntrouble here, thought Mr. Wilkins, mentally rubbing his professional\r\nhands. He could see himself being called in presently to advise. On the\r\none hand there was Arbuthnot, on the other hand here was Briggs.\r\nTrouble brewing, trouble sooner or later. But why had Briggs’s telegram\r\nacted on the lady like a blow? If she had turned pale from excess of\r\njoy, then trouble was nearer than he had supposed. She was not pale\r\nnow; she was more like her name than he had yet seen her. Well, he was\r\nthe man for trouble. He regretted, of course, that people should get\r\ninto it, but being in he was their man.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Wilkins, invigorated by these thoughts, his career being very\r\nprecious to him, proceeded to assist in doing the honours to Mr.\r\nBriggs, both in his quality of sharer in the temporary ownership of San\r\nSalvatore and of probable helper out of difficulties, with great\r\nhospitality, and pointed out the various features of the place to him,\r\nand led him to the parapet and showed him Mezzago across the bay.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher too was gracious. This was this young man’s house. He was a\r\nman of property. She liked property, and she liked men of property.\r\nAlso there seemed a peculiar merit in being a man of property so young.\r\nInheritance, of course; and inheritance was more respectable than\r\nacquisition. It did indicate fathers; and in an age where most people\r\nappeared neither to have them nor to want them she liked this too.\r\n\r\nAccordingly it was a pleasant meal, with everybody amiable and pleased.\r\nBriggs thought Mrs. Fisher a dear old lady, and showed he thought so;\r\nand again the magic worked, and she became a dear old lady. She\r\ndeveloped benignity with him, and a kind of benignity which was almost\r\nplayful—actually before tea was over including in some observation she\r\nmade him the words “My dear boy.”\r\n\r\nStrange words in Mrs. Fisher’s mouth. It is doubtful whether in her\r\nlife she had used them before. Rose was astonished. How nice people\r\nreally were. When would she leave off making mistakes about them? She\r\nhadn’t suspected this side of Mrs. Fisher, and she began to wonder\r\nwhether those other sides of her with which alone she was acquainted\r\nhad not perhaps after all been the effect of her own militant and\r\nirritating behaviour. Probably they were. How horrid, then, she must\r\nhave been. She felt very penitent when she saw Mrs. Fisher beneath her\r\neyes blossoming out into real amiability the moment some one came along\r\nwho was charming to her, and she could have sunk into the ground with\r\nshame when Mrs. Fisher presently laughed, and she realised by the shock\r\nit gave her that the sound was entirely new. Not once before had she or\r\nany one else there heard Mrs. Fisher laugh. What an indictment of the\r\nlot of them! For they had all laughed, the others, some more and some\r\nless, at one time or another since their arrival, and only Mrs. Fisher\r\nhad not. Clearly, since she could enjoy herself as she was now enjoying\r\nherself, she had not enjoyed herself before. Nobody had cared whether\r\nshe did or not, except perhaps Lotty. Yes; Lotty had cared, and had\r\nwanted her to be happy; but Lotty seemed to produce a bad effect on\r\nMrs. Fisher, while as for Rose herself she had never been with her for\r\nfive minutes without wanting, really wanting, to provoke and oppose\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHow very horrid she had been. She had behaved unpardonably. Her\r\npenitence showed itself in a shy and deferential solicitude towards\r\nMrs. Fisher which made the observant Briggs think her still more\r\nangelic, and wish for a moment that he were an old lady himself in\r\norder to be behaved to by Rose Arbuthnot just like that. There was\r\nevidently no end, he thought, to the things she could do sweetly. He\r\nwould even not mind taking medicine, really nasty medicine, if it were\r\nRose Arbuthnot bending over him with the dose.\r\n\r\nShe felt his bright blue eyes, the brighter because he was so sunburnt,\r\nfixed on her with a twinkle in them, and smiling asked him what he was\r\nthinking about.\r\n\r\nBut he couldn’t very well tell her that, he said; and added, “Some\r\nday.”\r\n\r\n“Trouble, trouble,” thought Mr. Wilkins at this, again mentally rubbing\r\nhis hands. “Well, I’m their man.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure,” said Mrs. Fisher benignly, “you have no thoughts we may not\r\nhear.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure,” said Briggs, “I would be telling you every one of my\r\nsecrets in a week.”\r\n\r\n“You would be telling somebody very safe, then,” said Mrs. Fisher\r\nbenevolently—just such a son would she have liked to have had. “And in\r\nreturn,” she went on, “I daresay I would tell you mine.”\r\n\r\n“Ah no,” said Mr. Wilkins, adapting himself to this tone of easy\r\n_badinage_, “I must protest. I really must. I have a prior claim, I am\r\nthe older friend. I have known Mrs. Fisher ten days, and you, Briggs,\r\nhave not yet known her one. I assert my right to be told her secrets\r\nfirst. That is,” he added, bowing gallantly, “if she has any—which I\r\nbeg leave to doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, haven’t I!” exclaimed Mrs. Fisher, thinking of those green leaves.\r\nThat she should exclaim at all was surprising, but that she should do\r\nit with gaiety was miraculous. Rose could only watch her in wonder.\r\n\r\n“Then I shall worm them out,” said Briggs with equal gaiety.\r\n\r\n“They won’t need much worming out,” said Mrs. Fisher. “My difficulty is\r\nto keep them from bursting out.”\r\n\r\nIt might have been Lotty talking. Mr. Wilkins adjusted the single\r\neyeglass he carried with him for occasions like this, and examined Mrs.\r\nFisher carefully. Rose looked on, unable not to smile too since Mrs.\r\nFisher seemed so much amused, though Rose did not quite know why, and\r\nher smile was a little uncertain, for Mrs. Fisher amused was a new\r\nsight, not without its awe-inspiring aspects, and had to be got\r\naccustomed to.\r\n\r\nWhat Mrs. Fisher was thinking was how much surprised they would be if\r\nshe told them of her very odd and exciting sensation of going to come\r\nout all over buds. They would think she was an extremely silly old\r\nwoman, and so would she have thought as lately as two days ago; but the\r\nbud idea was becoming familiar to her, she was more _apprivoisée_ now,\r\nas dear Matthew Arnold used to say, and though it would undoubtedly be\r\nbest if one’s appearance and sensations matched, yet supposing they did\r\nnot—and one couldn’t have everything—was it not better to feel young\r\nsomewhere rather than old everywhere? Time enough to be old everywhere\r\nagain, inside as well as out, when she got back to her sarcophagus in\r\nPrince of Wales Terrace.\r\n\r\nYet it is probable that without the arrival of Briggs Mrs. Fisher would\r\nhave gone on secretly fermenting in her shell. The others only knew her\r\nas severe. It would have been more than her dignity could bear suddenly\r\nto relax—especially towards the three young women. But now came the\r\nstranger Briggs, a stranger who at once took to her as no young man had\r\ntaken to her in her life, and it was the coming of Briggs and his real\r\nand manifest appreciation—for just such a grandmother, thought Briggs,\r\nhungry for home life and its concomitants, would he have liked to\r\nhave—that released Mrs. Fisher from her shell; and here she was at\r\nlast, as Lotty had predicted, pleased, good-humoured and benevolent.\r\n\r\nLotty, coming back half an hour later from her picnic, and following\r\nthe sound of voices into the top garden in the hope of still finding\r\ntea, saw at once what had happened, for Mrs. Fisher at that very moment\r\nwas laughing.\r\n\r\n“She’s burst her cocoon,” thought Lotty; and swift as she was in all\r\nher movements, and impulsive, and also without any sense of propriety\r\nto worry and delay her, she bent over the back of Mrs. Fisher’s chair\r\nand kissed her.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Fisher, starting violently, for such a\r\nthing had not happened to her since Mr. Fisher’s earlier days, and then\r\nonly gingerly. This kiss was a real kiss, and rested on Mrs. Fisher’s\r\ncheek a moment with a strange, soft sweetness.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw whose it was, a deep flush spread over her face. Mrs.\r\nWilkins kissing her and the kiss feeling so affectionate. . . Even if\r\nshe had wanted to she could not in the presence of the appreciative Mr.\r\nBriggs resume her cast-off severity and begin rebuking again; but she\r\ndid not want to. Was it possible Mrs. Wilkins liked her—had liked her\r\nall this time, while she had been so much disliking her herself? A\r\nqueer little trickle of warmth filtered through the frozen defences of\r\nMrs. Fisher’s heart. Somebody young kissing her—somebody young\r\n_wanting_ to kiss her. . . Very much flushed, she watched the strange\r\ncreature, apparently quite unconscious she had done anything\r\nextraordinary, shaking hands with Mr. Briggs, on her husband’s\r\nintroducing him, and immediately embarking on the friendliest\r\nconversation with him, exactly as if she had known him all her life.\r\nWhat a strange creature; what a very strange creature. It was natural,\r\nshe being so strange, that one should have, perhaps, misjudged her. . .\r\n\r\n“I’m sure you want some tea,” said Briggs with eager hospitality to\r\nLotty. He thought her delightful,—freckles, picnic-untidiness and all.\r\nJust such a sister would he—\r\n\r\n“This is cold,” he said, feeling the teapot. “I’ll tell Francesca to\r\nmake you some fresh—”\r\n\r\nHe broke off and blushed. “Aren’t I forgetting myself,” he said,\r\nlaughing and looking round at them.\r\n\r\n“Very natural, very natural,” Mr. Wilkins reassured him.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go and tell Francesca,” said Rose, getting up.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Briggs. “Don’t go away.” And he put his hands to his\r\nmouth and shouted.\r\n\r\n“Francesca!” shouted Briggs.\r\n\r\nShe came running. No summons in their experience had been answered by\r\nher with such celerity.\r\n\r\n“‘Her Master’s voice,’” remarked Mr. Wilkins; aptly, he considered.\r\n\r\n“Make fresh tea,” ordered Briggs in Italian. “Quick—quick—” And then\r\nremembering himself he blushed again, and begged everybody’s pardon.\r\n\r\n“Very natural, very natural,” Mr. Wilkins reassured him.\r\n\r\nBriggs then explained to Lotty what he had explained twice already,\r\nonce to Rose and once to the other two, that he was on his way to Rome\r\nand thought he would get out at Mezzago and just look in to see if they\r\nwere comfortable and continue his journey the next day, staying the\r\nnight in an hotel at Mezzago.\r\n\r\n“But how ridiculous,” said Lotty. “Of course you must stay here. It’s\r\nyour house. There’s Kate Lumley’s room,” she added, turning to Mrs.\r\nFisher. “You wouldn’t mind Mr. Briggs having it for one night? Kate\r\nLumley isn’t in it, you know,” she said turning to Briggs again and\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Fisher to her immense surprise laughed too. She knew that\r\nat any other time this remark would have struck her as excessively\r\nunseemly, and yet now she only thought it funny.\r\n\r\nNo indeed, she assured Briggs, Kate Lumley was not in that room. Very\r\nfortunately, for she was an excessively wide person and the room was\r\nexcessively narrow. Kate Lumley might get into it, but that was about\r\nall. Once in, she would fit it so tightly that probably she would never\r\nbe able to get out again. It was entirely at Mr. Briggs’s disposal, and\r\nshe hoped he would do nothing so absurd as go to an hotel—he, the owner\r\nof the whole place.\r\n\r\nRose listened to this speech wide-eyed with amazement. Mrs. Fisher\r\nlaughed very much as she made it. Lotty laughed very much too, and at\r\nthe end of it bent down and kissed her again—kissed her several times.\r\n\r\n“So you see, my dear boy,” said Mrs. Fisher, “you must stay here and\r\ngive us all a great deal of pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“A great deal indeed,” corroborated Mr. Wilkins heartily.\r\n\r\n“A very great deal,” repeated Mrs. Fisher, looking exactly like a\r\npleased mother.\r\n\r\n“Do,” said Rose, on Briggs’s turning inquiringly to her.\r\n\r\n“How kind of you all,” he said, his face broad with smiles. “I’d love\r\nto be a guest here. What a new sensation. And with three such—”\r\n\r\nHe broke off and looked round. “I say,” he asked, “oughtn’t I to have a\r\nfourth hostess? Francesca said she had four mistresses.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. There’s Lady Caroline,” said Lotty.\r\n\r\n“Then hadn’t we better find out first if she invites me too?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but she’s sure—” began Lotty.\r\n\r\n“The daughter of the Droitwiches, Briggs,” said Mr. Wilkins, “is not\r\nlikely to be wanting in the proper hospitable impulses.”\r\n\r\n“The daughter of the—” repeated Briggs; but he stopped dead, for there\r\nin the doorway was the daughter of the Droitwiches herself; or rather,\r\ncoming towards him out of the dark doorway into the brightness of the\r\nsunset, was that which he had not in his life yet seen but only dreamed\r\nof, his ideal of absolute loveliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 19\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then when she spoke . . . what chance was there for poor Briggs? He\r\nwas undone. All Scrap said was, “How do you do,” on Mr. Wilkins\r\npresenting him, but it was enough; it undid Briggs.\r\n\r\nFrom a cheerful, chatty, happy young man, overflowing with life and\r\nfriendliness, he became silent, solemn, and with little beads on his\r\ntemples. Also he became clumsy, dropping the teaspoon as he handed her\r\nher cup, mismanaging the macaroons, so that one rolled on the ground.\r\nHis eyes could not keep off the enchanting face for a moment; and when\r\nMr. Wilkins, elucidating him, for he failed to elucidate himself,\r\ninformed Lady Caroline that in Mr. Briggs she beheld the owner of San\r\nSalvatore, who was on his way to Rome, but had got out at Mezzago, etc.\r\netc., and that the other three ladies had invited him to spend the\r\nnight in what was to all intents and purposes his own house rather than\r\nan hotel, and Mr. Briggs was only waiting for the seal of her approval\r\nto this invitation, she being the fourth hostess—when Mr. Wilkins,\r\nbalancing his sentences and being admirably clear and enjoying the\r\nsound of his own cultured voice, explained the position in this manner\r\nto Lady Caroline, Briggs sat and said never a word.\r\n\r\nA deep melancholy invaded Scrap. The symptoms of the incipient grabber\r\nwere all there and only too familiar, and she knew that if Briggs\r\nstayed her rest-cure might be regarded as over.\r\n\r\nThen Kate Lumley occurred to her. She caught at Kate as at a straw.\r\n\r\n“It would have been delightful,” she said, faintly smiling at\r\nBriggs—she could not in decency not smile, at least a little, but even\r\na little betrayed the dimple, and Briggs’s eyes became more fixed than\r\never—“I’m only wondering if there is room.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is,” said Lotty. “There’s Kate Lumley’s room.”\r\n\r\n“I thought,” said Scrap to Mrs. Fisher, and it seemed to Briggs that he\r\nhad never heard music till now, “your friend was expected immediately.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said Mrs. Fisher—with an odd placidness, Scrap thought.\r\n\r\n“Miss Lumley,” said Mr. Wilkins, “—or should I,” he inquired of Mrs.\r\nFisher, “say Mrs.?”\r\n\r\n“Nobody has ever married Kate,” said Mrs. Fisher complacently.\r\n\r\n“Quite so. Miss Lumley does not arrive to-day in any case, Lady\r\nCaroline, and Mr. Briggs has—unfortunately, if I may say so—to continue\r\nhis journey to-morrow, so that his staying would in no way interfere\r\nwith Miss Lumley’s possible movements.”\r\n\r\n“Then of course I join in the invitation,” said Scrap, with what was to\r\nBriggs the most divine cordiality.\r\n\r\nHe stammered something, flushing scarlet, and Scrap thought, “Oh,” and\r\nturned her head away; but that merely made Briggs acquainted with her\r\nprofile, and if there existed anything more lovely than Scrap’s full\r\nface it was her profile.\r\n\r\nWell, it was only for this one afternoon and evening. He would leave,\r\nno doubt, the first thing in the morning. It took hours to get to Rome.\r\nAwful if he hung on till the night train. She had a feeling that the\r\nprincipal express to Rome passed through at night. Why hadn’t that\r\nwoman Kate Lumley arrived yet? She had forgotten all about her, but now\r\nshe remembered she was to have been invited a fortnight ago. What had\r\nbecome of her? This man, once let in, would come and see her in London,\r\nwould haunt the places she was likely to go to. He had the makings, her\r\nexperienced eye could see, of a passionately persistent grabber.\r\n\r\n“If,” thought Mr. Wilkins, observing Briggs’s face and sudden silence,\r\n“any understanding existed between this young fellow and Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, there is now going to be trouble. Trouble of a different\r\nnature from the kind I feared, in which Arbuthnot would have played a\r\nleading part, in fact the part of petitioner, but trouble that may need\r\nhelp and advice none the less for its not being publicly scandalous.\r\nBriggs, impelled by his passions and her beauty, will aspire to the\r\ndaughter of the Droitwiches. She, naturally and properly, will repel\r\nhim. Mrs. Arbuthnot, left in the cold, will be upset and show it.\r\nArbuthnot on his arrival will find his wife in enigmatic tears.\r\nInquiring into their cause, he will be met with an icy reserve. More\r\ntrouble may then be expected, and in me they will seek and find their\r\nadviser. When Lotty said Mrs. Arbuthnot wanted her husband, she was\r\nwrong. What Mrs. Arbuthnot wants is Briggs, and it looks uncommonly as\r\nif she were not going to get him. Well, I’m their man.”\r\n\r\n“Where are your things, Mr. Briggs?” asked Mrs. Fisher, her voice round\r\nwith motherliness. “Oughtn’t they to be fetched?” For the sun was\r\nnearly in the sea now, and the sweet-smelling April dampness that\r\nfollowed immediately on its disappearance was beginning to steal into\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nBriggs started. “My things?” he repeated. “Oh yes—I must fetch them.\r\nThey’re in Mezzago. I’ll send Domenico. My fly is waiting in the\r\nvillage. He can go back in it. I’ll go and tell him.”\r\n\r\nHe got up. To whom was he talking? To Mrs. Fisher, ostensibly, yet his\r\neyes were fixed on Scrap, who said nothing and looked at no one.\r\n\r\nThen, recollecting himself, he stammered, “I’m awfully sorry—I keep on\r\nforgetting—I’ll go down and fetch them myself.”\r\n\r\n“We can easily send Domenico,” said Rose; and at her gentle voice he\r\nturned his head.\r\n\r\nWhy, there was his friend, the sweet-named lady—but how had she not in\r\nthis short interval changed! Was it the failing light making her so\r\ncolourless, so vague-featured, so dim, so much like a ghost? A nice\r\ngood ghost, of course, and still with a pretty name, but only a ghost.\r\n\r\nHe turned from her to Scrap again, and forgot Rose Arbuthnot’s\r\nexistence. How was it possible for him to bother about anybody or\r\nanything else in this first moment of being face to face with his dream\r\ncome true?\r\n\r\nBriggs had not supposed or hoped that any one as beautiful as his dream\r\nof beauty existed. He had never till now met even an approximation.\r\nPretty women, charming women by the score he had met and properly\r\nappreciated, but never the real, the godlike thing itself. He used to\r\nthink, “If ever I saw a perfectly beautiful woman I should die”; and\r\nthough, having now met what to his ideas was a perfectly beautiful\r\nwoman, he did not die, he became very nearly as incapable of managing\r\nhis own affairs as if he had.\r\n\r\nThe others were obliged to arrange everything for him. By questions\r\nthey extracted from him that his luggage was in the station cloakroom\r\nat Mezzago, and they sent for Domenico, and, urged and prompted by\r\neverybody except Scrap, who sat in silence and looked at no one, Briggs\r\nwas induced to give him the necessary instructions for going back in\r\nthe fly and bringing out his things.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad sight to see the collapse of Briggs. Everybody noticed it,\r\neven Rose.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” thought Mrs. Fisher, “the way one pretty face can turn\r\na delightful man into an idiot is past all patience.”\r\n\r\nAnd feeling the air getting chilly, and the sight of the enthralled\r\nBriggs painful, she went in to order his room to be got ready,\r\nregretting now that she had pressed the poor boy to stay. She had\r\nforgotten Lady Caroline’s kill-joy face for the moment, and the more\r\ncompletely owing to the absence of any ill effects produced by it on\r\nMr. Wilkins. Poor boy. Such a charming boy too, left to himself. It was\r\ntrue she could not accuse Lady Caroline of not leaving him to himself,\r\nfor she was taking no notice of him at all, but that did not help.\r\nExactly like foolish moths did men, in other respects intelligent,\r\nflutter round the impassive lighted candle of a pretty face. She had\r\nseen them doing it. She had looked on only too often. Almost she laid a\r\nmotherly hand on Briggs’s fair head as she passed him. Poor boy.\r\n\r\nThen Scrap, having finished her cigarette, got up and went indoors too.\r\nShe saw no reason why she should sit there in order to gratify Mr.\r\nBriggs’s desire to stare. She would have liked to stay out longer, to\r\ngo to her corner behind the daphne bushes and look at the sunset sky\r\nand watch the lights coming out one by one in the village below and\r\nsmell the sweet moistness of the evening, but if she did Mr. Briggs\r\nwould certainly follow her.\r\n\r\nThe old familiar tyranny had begun again. Her holiday of peace and\r\nliberation was interrupted—perhaps over, for who knew if he would go\r\naway, after all, to-morrow? He might leave the house, driven out of it\r\nby Kate Lumley, but there was nothing to prevent his taking rooms in\r\nthe village and coming up every day. This tyranny of one person over\r\nanother! And she was so miserably constructed that she wouldn’t even be\r\nable to frown him down without being misunderstood.\r\n\r\nScrap, who loved this time of the evening in her corner, felt indignant\r\nwith Mr. Briggs who was doing her out of it, and she turned her back on\r\nthe garden and him and went towards the house without a look or a word.\r\nBut Briggs, when he realised her intention, leapt to his feet, snatched\r\nchairs which were not in her way out of it, kicked a footstool which\r\nwas not in her path on one side, hurried to the door, which stood wide\r\nopen, in order to hold it open, and followed her through it, walking by\r\nher side along the hall.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done with Mr. Briggs? Well, it was his hall; she\r\ncouldn’t prevent his walking along it.\r\n\r\n“I hope,” he said, not able while walking to take his eyes off her, so\r\nthat he knocked against several things he would otherwise have\r\navoided—the corner of a bookcase, an ancient carved cupboard, the table\r\nwith the flowers on it, shaking the water over—“that you are quite\r\ncomfortable here? If you’re not I’ll—I’ll flay them alive.”\r\n\r\nHis voice vibrated. What was to be done with Mr. Briggs? She could of\r\ncourse stay in her room the whole time, say she was ill, not appear at\r\ndinner; but again, the tyranny of this . . .\r\n\r\n“I’m very comfortable indeed,” said Scrap.\r\n\r\n“If I had dreamed you were coming—” he began.\r\n\r\n“It’s a wonderful old place,” said Scrap, doing her utmost to sound\r\ndetached and forbidding, but with little hope of success.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was on this floor, and passing its door, which was open a\r\ncrack, they were observed by the servants, whose thoughts, communicated\r\nto each other by looks, may be roughly reproduced by such rude symbols\r\nas Aha and Oho—symbols which represented and included their\r\nappreciation of the inevitable, their foreknowledge of the inevitable,\r\nand their complete understanding and approval.\r\n\r\n“Are you going upstairs?” asked Briggs, as she paused at the foot of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Which room do you sit in? The drawing-room, or the small yellow room?”\r\n\r\n“In my own room.”\r\n\r\nSo then he couldn’t go up with her; so then all he could do was to wait\r\ntill she came out again.\r\n\r\nHe longed to ask her which was her own room—it thrilled him to hear her\r\ncall any room in his house her own room—that he might picture her in\r\nit. He longed to know if by any happy chance it was his room, for ever\r\nafter to be filled with her wonder; but he didn’t dare. He would find\r\nthat out later from some one else—Francesca, anybody.\r\n\r\n“Then I shan’t see you again till dinner?”\r\n\r\n“Dinner is at eight,” was Scrap’s evasive answer as she went upstairs.\r\n\r\nHe watched her go.\r\n\r\nShe passed the Madonna, the portrait of Rose Arbuthnot, and the\r\ndark-eyed figure he had thought so sweet seemed to turn pale, to\r\nshrivel into insignificance as she passed.\r\n\r\nShe turned the bend of the stairs, and the setting sun, shining through\r\nthe west window a moment on her face, turned her to glory.\r\n\r\nShe disappeared, and the sun went out too, and the stairs were dark and\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nHe listened till her footsteps were silent, trying to tell from the\r\nsound of the shutting door which room she had gone into, then wandered\r\naimlessly away through the hall again, and found himself back in the\r\ntop garden.\r\n\r\nScrap from her window saw him there. She saw Lotty and Rose sitting on\r\nthe end parapet, where she would have liked to have been, and she saw\r\nMr. Wilkins buttonholing Briggs and evidently telling him the story of\r\nthe oleander tree in the middle of the garden.\r\n\r\nBriggs was listening with a patience she thought rather nice, seeing\r\nthat it was his oleander and his own father’s story. She knew Mr.\r\nWilkins was telling him the story by his gestures. Domenico had told it\r\nher soon after her arrival, and he had also told Mrs. Fisher, who had\r\ntold Mr. Wilkins. Mrs. Fisher thought highly of this story, and often\r\nspoke of it. It was about a cherrywood walking-stick. Briggs’s father\r\nhad thrust this stick into the ground at that spot, and said to\r\nDomenico’s father, who was then the gardener, “Here we will have an\r\noleander.” And Briggs’s father left the stick in the ground as a\r\nreminder to Domenico’s father, and presently—how long afterwards nobody\r\nremembered—the stick began to sprout, and it was an oleander.\r\n\r\nThere stood poor Mr. Briggs being told all about it, and listening to\r\nthe story he must have known from infancy with patience.\r\n\r\nProbably he was thinking of something else. She was afraid he was. How\r\nunfortunate, how extremely unfortunate, the determination that seized\r\npeople to get hold of and engulf other people. If only they could be\r\ninduced to stand more on their own feet. Why couldn’t Mr. Briggs be\r\nmore like Lotty, who never wanted anything of anybody, but was complete\r\nin herself and respected other people’s completeness? One loved being\r\nwith Lotty. With her one was free, and yet befriended. Mr. Briggs\r\nlooked so really nice, too. She thought she might like him if only he\r\nwouldn’t so excessively like her.\r\n\r\nScrap felt melancholy. Here she was shut up in her bedroom, which was\r\nstuffy from the afternoon sun that had been pouring into it, instead of\r\nout in the cool garden, and all because of Mr. Briggs.\r\n\r\nIntolerable tyranny, she thought, flaring up. She wouldn’t endure it;\r\nshe would go out all the same; she would run downstairs while Mr.\r\nWilkins—really that man was a treasure—held Mr. Briggs down telling him\r\nabout the oleander, and get out of the house by the front door, and\r\ntake cover in the shadows of the zigzag path. Nobody could see her\r\nthere; nobody would think of looking for her there.\r\n\r\nShe snatched up a wrap, for she did not mean to come back for a long\r\nwhile, perhaps not even to dinner—it would be all Mr. Briggs’s fault if\r\nshe went dinnerless and hungry—and with another glance out of the\r\nwindow to see if she were still safe, she stole out and got away to the\r\nsheltering trees of the zigzag path, and there sat down on one of the\r\nseats placed at each bend to assist the upward journey of those who\r\nwere breathless.\r\n\r\nAh, this was lovely, thought Scrap with a sigh of relief. How cool. How\r\ngood it smelt. She could see the quiet water of the little harbour\r\nthrough the pine trunks, and the lights coming out in the houses on the\r\nother side, and all round her the green dusk was splashed by the\r\nrose-pink of the gladioluses in the grass and the white of the crowding\r\ndaisies.\r\n\r\nAh, this was lovely. So still. Nothing moving—not a leaf, not a stalk.\r\nThe only sound was a dog barking, far away somewhere up on the hills,\r\nor when the door of the little restaurant in the piazza below was\r\nopened and there was a burst of voices, silenced again immediately by\r\nthe swinging to of the door.\r\n\r\nShe drew in a deep breath of pleasure. Ah, this was—\r\n\r\nHer deep breath was arrested in the middle. What was that?\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward listening, her body tense.\r\n\r\nFootsteps. On the zigzag path. Briggs. Finding her out.\r\n\r\nShould she run?\r\n\r\nNo—the footsteps were coming up, not down. Some one from the village.\r\nPerhaps Angelo, with provisions.\r\n\r\nShe relaxed again. But the steps were not the steps of Angelo, that\r\nswift and springy youth; they were slow and considered, and they kept\r\non pausing.\r\n\r\n“Some one who isn’t used to hills,” thought Scrap.\r\n\r\nThe idea of going back to the house did not occur to her. She was\r\nafraid of nothing in life except love. Brigands or murderers as such\r\nheld no terrors for the daughter of the Droitwiches; she only would\r\nhave been afraid of them if they left off being brigands and murderers\r\nand began instead to try and make love.\r\n\r\nThe next moment the footsteps turned the corner of her bit of path, and\r\nstood still.\r\n\r\n“Getting his wind,” thought Scrap, not looking round.\r\n\r\nThen as he—from the sounds of the steps she took them to belong to a\r\nman—did not move, she turned her head, and beheld with astonishment a\r\nperson she had seen a good deal of lately in London, the well-known\r\nwriter of amusing memoirs, Mr. Ferdinand Arundel.\r\n\r\nShe stared. Nothing in the way of being followed surprised her any\r\nmore, but that he should have discovered where she was surprised her.\r\nHer mother had promised faithfully to tell no one.\r\n\r\n“You?” she said, feeling betrayed. “Here?”\r\n\r\nHe came up to her and took off his hat. His forehead beneath the hat\r\nwas wet with the beads of unaccustomed climbing. He looked ashamed and\r\nentreating, like a guilty but devoted dog.\r\n\r\n“You must forgive me,” he said. “Lady Droitwich told me where you were,\r\nand as I happened to be passing through on my way to Rome I thought I\r\nwould get out at Mezzago and just look in and see how you were.”\r\n\r\n“But—didn’t my mother tell you I was doing a rest-cure?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. She did. And that’s why I haven’t intruded on you earlier in the\r\nday. I thought you would probably sleep all day, and wake up about now\r\nso as to be fed.”\r\n\r\n“But—”\r\n\r\n“I know. I’ve got nothing to say in excuse. I couldn’t help myself.”\r\n\r\n“This,” thought Scrap, “comes of mother insisting on having authors to\r\nlunch, and me being so much more amiable in appearance than I really\r\nam.”\r\n\r\nShe had been amiable to Ferdinand Arundel; she liked him—or rather she\r\ndid not dislike him. He seemed a jovial, simple man, and had the eyes\r\nof a nice dog. Also, though it was evident that he admired her, he had\r\nnot in London grabbed. There he had merely been a good-natured,\r\nharmless person of entertaining conversation, who helped to make\r\nluncheons agreeable. Now it appeared that he too was a grabber. Fancy\r\nfollowing her out there—daring to. Nobody else had. Perhaps her mother\r\nhad given him the address because she considered him so absolutely\r\nharmless, and thought he might be useful and see her home.\r\n\r\nWell, whatever he was he couldn’t possibly give her the trouble an\r\nactive young man like Mr. Briggs might give her. Mr. Briggs,\r\ninfatuated, would be reckless, she felt, would stick at nothing, would\r\nlose his head publicly. She could imagine Mr. Briggs doing things with\r\nrope-ladders, and singing all night under her window—being really\r\ndifficult and uncomfortable. Mr. Arundel hadn’t the figure for any kind\r\nof recklessness. He had lived too long and too well. She was sure he\r\ncouldn’t sing, and wouldn’t want to. He must be at least forty. How\r\nmany good dinners could not a man have eaten by the time he was forty?\r\nAnd if during that time instead of taking exercise he had sat writing\r\nbooks, he would quite naturally acquire the figure Mr. Arundel had in\r\nfact acquired—the figure rather for conversation than adventure.\r\n\r\nScrap, who had become melancholy at the sight of Briggs, became\r\nphilosophical at the sight of Arundel. Here he was. She couldn’t send\r\nhim away till after dinner. He must be nourished.\r\n\r\nThis being so, she had better make the best of it, and do that with a\r\ngood grace which anyhow wasn’t to be avoided. Besides, he would be a\r\ntemporary shelter from Mr. Briggs. She was at least acquainted with\r\nFerdinand Arundel, and could hear news from him of her mother and her\r\nfriends, and such talk would put up a defensive barrier at dinner\r\nbetween herself and the approaches of the other one. And it was only\r\nfor one dinner, and he couldn’t eat _her_.\r\n\r\nShe therefore prepared herself for friendliness. “I’m to be fed,” she\r\nsaid, ignoring his last remark, “at eight, and you must come up and be\r\nfed too. Sit down and get cool and tell me how everybody is.”\r\n\r\n“May I really dine with you? In these travelling things?” he said,\r\nwiping his forehead before sitting down beside her.\r\n\r\nShe was too lovely to be true, he thought. Just to look at her for an\r\nhour, just to hear her voice, was enough reward for his journey and his\r\nfears.\r\n\r\n“Of course. I suppose you’ve left your fly in the village, and will be\r\ngoing on from Mezzago by the night train.”\r\n\r\n“Or stay in Mezzago in an hotel and go on to-morrow. But tell me,” he\r\nsaid, gazing at the adorable profile, “about yourself. London has been\r\nextraordinarily dull and empty. Lady Droitwich said you were with\r\npeople here she didn’t know. I hope they’ve been kind to you? You\r\nlook—well, as if your cure had done everything a cure should.”\r\n\r\n“They’ve been very kind,” said Scrap. “I got them out of an\r\nadvertisement.”\r\n\r\n“An advertisement?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a good way, I find, to get friends. I’m fonder of one of these\r\nthan I’ve been of anybody in years.”\r\n\r\n“Really? Who is it?”\r\n\r\n“You shall guess which of them it is when you see them. Tell me about\r\nmother. When did you see her last? We arranged not to write to each\r\nother unless there was something special. I wanted to have a month that\r\nwas perfectly blank.”\r\n\r\n“And now I’ve come and interrupted. I can’t tell you how ashamed I\r\nam—both of having done it and of not having been able to help it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but,” said Scrap quickly, for he could not have come on a better\r\nday, when up there waiting and watching for her was, she knew, the\r\nenamoured Briggs, “I’m really very glad indeed to see you. Tell me\r\nabout mother.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 20\r\n\r\n\r\nScrap wanted to know so much about her mother that Arundel had\r\npresently to invent. He would talk about anything she wished if only he\r\nmight be with her for a while and see her and hear her, but he knew\r\nvery little of the Droitwiches and their friends really—beyond meeting\r\nthem at those bigger functions where literature is also represented,\r\nand amusing them at luncheons and dinners, he knew very little of them\r\nreally. To them he had always remained Mr. Arundel; no one called him\r\nFerdinand; and he only knew the gossip also available to the evening\r\npapers and the frequenters of clubs. But he was, however, good at\r\ninventing; and as soon as he had come to an end of first-hand\r\nknowledge, in order to answer her inquiries and keep her there to\r\nhimself he proceeded to invent. It was quite easy to fasten some of the\r\nentertaining things he was constantly thinking on to other people and\r\npretend they were theirs. Scrap, who had that affection for her parents\r\nwhich warms in absence, was athirst for news, and became more and more\r\ninterested by the news he gradually imparted.\r\n\r\nAt first it was ordinary news. He had met her mother here, and seen her\r\nthere. She looked very well; she said so and so. But presently the\r\nthings Lady Droitwich had said took on an unusual quality: they became\r\namusing.\r\n\r\n“Mother said _that?_” Scrap interrupted, surprised.\r\n\r\nAnd presently Lady Droitwich began to do amusing things as well as say\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“_Mother_ did that?” Scrap inquired, wide-eyed.\r\n\r\nArundel warmed to his work. He fathered some of the most entertaining\r\nideas he had lately had on to Lady Droitwich, and also any charming\r\nfunny things that had been done—or might have been done, for he could\r\nimagine almost anything.\r\n\r\nScrap’s eyes grew round with wonder and affectionate pride in her\r\nmother. Why, but how funny—fancy mother. What an old darling. Did she\r\nreally do that? How perfectly adorable of her. And did she really\r\nsay—but how wonderful of her to think of it. What sort of a face did\r\nLloyd George make?\r\n\r\nShe laughed and laughed, and had a great longing to hug her mother, and\r\nthe time flew, and it grew quite dusk, and it grew nearly dark, and Mr.\r\nArundel still went on amusing her, and it was a quarter to eight before\r\nshe suddenly remembered dinner.\r\n\r\n“Oh, good heavens!” she exclaimed, jumping up.\r\n\r\n“Yes. It’s late,” said Arundel.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go on quickly and send the maid to you. I must run, or I’ll never\r\nbe ready in time—”\r\n\r\nAnd she was gone up the path with the swiftness of a young, slender\r\ndeer.\r\n\r\nArundel followed. He did not wish to arrive too hot, so had to go\r\nslowly. Fortunately he was near the top, and Francesca came down the\r\npergola to pilot him indoors, and having shown him where he could wash\r\nshe put him in the empty drawing-room to cool himself by the crackling\r\nwood fire.\r\n\r\nHe got as far away from the fire as he could, and stood in one of the\r\ndeep window-recesses looking out at the distant lights of Mezzago. The\r\ndrawing-room door was open, and the house was quiet with the hush that\r\nprecedes dinner, when the inhabitants are all shut up in their rooms\r\ndressing. Briggs in his room was throwing away spoilt tie after spoilt\r\ntie; Scrap in hers was hurrying into a black frock with a vague notion\r\nthat Mr. Briggs wouldn’t be able to see her so clearly in black; Mrs.\r\nFisher was fastening the lace shawl, which nightly transformed her day\r\ndress into her evening dress, with the brooch Ruskin had given her on\r\nher marriage, formed of two pearl lilies tied together by a blue enamel\r\nribbon on which was written in gold letters _Esto perpetua;_ Mr.\r\nWilkins was sitting on the edge of his bed brushing his wife’s\r\nhair—thus far in this third week had he progressed in\r\ndemonstrativeness—while she, for her part, sitting on a chair in front\r\nof him, put his studs in a clean shirt; and Rose, ready dressed, sat at\r\nher window considering her day.\r\n\r\nRose was quite aware of what had happened to Mr. Briggs. If she had had\r\nany difficulty about it, Lotty would have removed it by the frank\r\ncomments she made while she and Rose sat together after tea on the\r\nwall. Lotty was delighted at more love being introduced into San\r\nSalvatore, even if it were only one-sided, and said that when once\r\nRose’s husband was there she didn’t suppose, now that Mrs. Fisher too\r\nhad at last come unglued—Rose protested at the expression, and Lotty\r\nretorted that it was in Keats—there would be another place in the world\r\nmore swarming with happiness than San Salvatore.\r\n\r\n“Your husband,” said Lotty, swinging her feet, “might be here quite\r\nsoon, perhaps to-morrow evening if he starts at once, and there’ll be a\r\nglorious final few days before we all go home refreshed for life. I\r\ndon’t believe any of us will ever be the same again—and I wouldn’t be a\r\nbit surprised if Caroline doesn’t end by getting fond of the young man\r\nBriggs. It’s in the air. You _have_ to get fond of people here.”\r\n\r\nRose sat at her window thinking of these things. Lotty’s optimism . . .\r\nyet it had been justified by Mr. Wilkins; and look, too, at Mrs.\r\nFisher. If only it would come true as well about Frederick! For Rose,\r\nwho between lunch and tea had left off thinking about Frederick, was\r\nnow, between tea and dinner, thinking of him harder than ever.\r\n\r\nIt had been funny and delightful, that little interlude of admiration,\r\nbut of course it couldn’t go on once Caroline appeared. Rose knew her\r\nplace. She could see as well as any one the unusual, the unique\r\nloveliness of Lady Caroline. How warm, though, things like admiration\r\nand appreciation made one feel, how capable of really deserving them,\r\nhow different, how glowing. They seemed to quicken unsuspected\r\nfaculties into life. She was sure she had been a thoroughly amusing\r\nwoman between lunch and tea, and a pretty one too. She was quite\r\ncertain she had been pretty; she saw it in Mr. Briggs’s eyes as clearly\r\nas in a looking-glass. For a brief space, she thought, she had been\r\nlike a torpid fly brought back to gay buzzing by the lighting of a fire\r\nin a wintry room. She still buzzed, she still tingled, just at the\r\nremembrance. What fun it had been, having an admirer even for that\r\nlittle while. No wonder people liked admirers. They seemed, in some\r\nstrange way, to make one come alive.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was all over she still glowed with it and felt more\r\nexhilarated, more optimistic, more as Lotty probably constantly felt,\r\nthan she had done since she was a girl. She dressed with care, though\r\nshe knew Mr. Briggs would no longer see her, but it gave her pleasure\r\nto see how pretty, while she was about it, she could make herself look;\r\nand very nearly she stuck a crimson camellia in her hair down by her\r\near. She did hold it there for a minute, and it looked almost sinfully\r\nattractive and was exactly the colour of her mouth, but she took it out\r\nagain with a smile and a sigh and put it in the proper place for\r\nflowers, which is water. She mustn’t be silly, she thought. Think of\r\nthe poor. Soon she would be back with them again, and what would a\r\ncamellia behind her ear seem like then? Simply fantastic.\r\n\r\nBut on one thing she was determined: the first thing she would do when\r\nshe got home would be to have it out with Frederick. If he didn’t come\r\nto San Salvatore that is what she would do—the very first thing. Long\r\nago she ought to have done this, but always she had been handicapped,\r\nwhen she tried to, by being so dreadfully fond of him and so much\r\nafraid that fresh wounds were going to be given her wretched, soft\r\nheart. But now let him wound her as much as he chose, as much as he\r\npossibly could, she would still have it out with him. Not that he ever\r\nintentionally wounded her; she knew he never meant to, she knew he\r\noften had no idea of having done it. For a person who wrote books,\r\nthought Rose, Frederick didn’t seem to have much imagination. Anyhow,\r\nshe said to herself, getting up from the dressing-table, things\r\ncouldn’t go on like this. She would have it out with him. This separate\r\nlife, this freezing loneliness, she had had enough of it. Why shouldn’t\r\nshe too be happy? Why on earth—the energetic expression matched her\r\nmood of rebelliousness—shouldn’t she too be loved and allowed to love?\r\n\r\nShe looked at her little clock. Still ten minutes before dinner. Tired\r\nof staying in her bedroom she thought she would go on to Mrs. Fisher’s\r\nbattlements, which would be empty at this hour, and watch the moon rise\r\nout of the sea.\r\n\r\nShe went into the deserted upper hall with this intention, but was\r\nattracted on her way along it by the firelight shining through the open\r\ndoor of the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nHow gay it looked. The fire transformed the room. A dark, ugly room in\r\nthe daytime, it was transformed just as she had been transformed by the\r\nwarmth of—no, she wouldn’t be silly; she would think of the poor; the\r\nthought of them always brought her down to sobriety at once.\r\n\r\nShe peeped in. Firelight and flowers; and outside the deep slits of\r\nwindows hung the blue curtain of the night. How pretty. What a sweet\r\nplace San Salvatore was. And that gorgeous lilac on the table—she must\r\ngo and put her face in it . . .\r\n\r\nBut she never got to the lilac. She went one step towards it, and then\r\nstood still, for she had seen the figure looking out of the window in\r\nthe farthest corner, and it was Frederick.\r\n\r\nAll the blood in Rose’s body rushed to her heart and seemed to stop its\r\nbeating.\r\n\r\nFrederick. Come.\r\n\r\nShe stood quite still. He had not heard her. He did not turn round. She\r\nstood looking at him. The miracle had happened, and he had come.\r\n\r\nShe stood holding her breath. So he needed her, for he had come\r\ninstantly. So he too must have been thinking, longing . . .\r\n\r\nHer heart, which had seemed to stop beating, was suffocating her now,\r\nthe way it raced along. Frederick did love her then—he must love her,\r\nor why had he come? Something, perhaps her absence, had made him turn\r\nto her, want her . . . and now the understanding she had made up her\r\nmind to have with him would be quite—would be quite—easy—\r\n\r\nHer thoughts wouldn’t go on. Her mind stammered. She couldn’t think.\r\nShe could only see and feel. She didn’t know how it had happened. It\r\nwas a miracle. God could do miracles. God had done this one. God\r\ncould—God could—could—\r\n\r\nHer mind stammered again, and broke off.\r\n\r\n“Frederick—” she tried to say; but no sound came, or if it did the\r\ncrackling of the fire covered it up.\r\n\r\nShe must go nearer. She began to creep towards him—softly, softly.\r\n\r\nHe did not move. He had not heard.\r\n\r\nShe stole nearer and nearer, and the fire crackled and he heard\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nShe stopped a moment, unable to breathe. She was afraid. Suppose\r\nhe—suppose he—oh, but he had come, he had come.\r\n\r\nShe went on again, close up to him, and her heart beat so loud that she\r\nthought he must hear it. And couldn’t he feel—didn’t he know—\r\n\r\n“Frederick,” she whispered, hardly able even to whisper, choked by the\r\nbeating of her heart.\r\n\r\nHe spun round on his heels.\r\n\r\n“Rose!” he exclaimed, staring blankly.\r\n\r\nBut she did not see his stare, for her arms were round his neck, and\r\nher cheek was against his, and she was murmuring, her lips on his ear,\r\n“I knew you would come—in my very heart I always, always knew you would\r\ncome—”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 21\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Frederick was not the man to hurt anything if he could help it;\r\nbesides, he was completely bewildered. Not only was his wife here—here,\r\nof all places in the world—but she was clinging to him as she had not\r\nclung for years, and murmuring love, and welcoming him. If she welcomed\r\nhim she must have been expecting him. Strange as this was, it was the\r\nonly thing in the situation which was evident—that, and the softness of\r\nher cheek against his, and the long-forgotten sweet smell of her.\r\n\r\nFrederick was bewildered. But not being the man to hurt anything if he\r\ncould help it he too put his arms round her, and having put them round\r\nher he also kissed her; and presently he was kissing her almost as\r\ntenderly as she was kissing him; and presently he was kissing her quite\r\nas tenderly; and again presently he was kissing her more tenderly, and\r\njust as if he had never left off.\r\n\r\nHe was bewildered, but he still could kiss. It seemed curiously natural\r\nto be doing it. It made him feel as if he were thirty again instead of\r\nforty, and Rose were his Rose of twenty, the Rose he had so much adored\r\nbefore she began to weigh what he did with her idea of right, and the\r\nbalance went against him, and she had turned strange, and stony, and\r\nmore and more shocked, and oh, so lamentable. He couldn’t get at her in\r\nthose days at all; she wouldn’t, she couldn’t understand. She kept on\r\nreferring everything to what she called God’s eyes—in God’s eyes it\r\ncouldn’t be right, it wasn’t right. Her miserable face—whatever her\r\nprinciples did for her they didn’t make her happy—her little miserable\r\nface, twisted with effort to be patient, had been at last more than he\r\ncould bear to see, and he had kept away as much as he could. She never\r\nought to have been the daughter of a low-church rector—narrow devil;\r\nshe was quite unfitted to stand up against such an upbringing.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened, why she was here, why she was his Rose again, passed\r\nhis comprehension; and meanwhile, and until such time as he understood,\r\nhe still could kiss. In fact he could not stop kissing; and it was he\r\nnow who began to murmur, to say love things in her ear under the hair\r\nthat smelt so sweet and tickled him just as he remembered it used to\r\ntickle him.\r\n\r\nAnd as he held her close to his heart and her arms were soft round his\r\nneck, he felt stealing over him a delicious sense of—at first he didn’t\r\nknow what it was, this delicate, pervading warmth, and then he\r\nrecognised it as security. Yes; security. No need now to be ashamed of\r\nhis figure, and to make jokes about it so as to forestall other\r\npeople’s and show he didn’t mind it; no need now to be ashamed of\r\ngetting hot going up hills, or to torment himself with pictures of how\r\nhe probably appeared to beautiful young women—how middle-aged, how\r\nabsurd in his inability to keep away from them. Rose cared nothing for\r\nsuch things. With her he was safe. To her he was her lover, as he used\r\nto be; and she would never notice or mind any of the ignoble changes\r\nthat getting older had made in him and would go on making more and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nFrederick continued, therefore, with greater and greater warmth and\r\ngrowing delight to kiss his wife, and the mere holding of her in\r\nhis arms caused him to forget everything else. How could he, for\r\ninstance, remember or think of Lady Caroline, to mention only one of\r\nthe complications with which his situation bristled, when here was his\r\nsweet wife, miraculously restored to him, whispering with her cheek\r\nagainst his in the dearest, most romantic words how much she loved him,\r\nhow terribly she had missed him? He did for one brief instant, for even\r\nin moments of love there are brief instants of lucid thought, recognise\r\nthe immense power of the woman present and being actually held compared\r\nto that of the woman, however beautiful, who is somewhere else, but\r\nthat is as far as he got towards remembering Scrap; no farther. She was\r\nlike a dream, fleeing before the morning light.\r\n\r\n“When did you start?” murmured Rose, her mouth on his ear. She couldn’t\r\nlet him go; not even to talk she couldn’t let him go.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday morning,” murmured Frederick, holding her close. He couldn’t\r\nlet her go either.\r\n\r\n“Oh—the very instant then,” murmured Rose.\r\n\r\nThis was cryptic, but Frederick said, “Yes, the very instant,” and\r\nkissed her neck.\r\n\r\n“How quickly my letter got to you,” murmured Rose, whose eyes were shut\r\nin the excess of her happiness.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t it,” said Frederick, who felt like shutting his eyes himself.\r\n\r\nSo there had been a letter. Soon, no doubt, light would be vouchsafed\r\nhim, and meanwhile this was so strangely, touchingly sweet, this\r\nholding his Rose to his heart again after all the years, that he\r\ncouldn’t bother to try to guess anything. Oh, he had been happy during\r\nthese years, because it was not in him to be unhappy; besides, how many\r\ninterests life had had to offer him, how many friends, how much\r\nsuccess, how many women only too willing to help him to blot out the\r\nthought of the altered, petrified, pitiful little wife at home who\r\nwouldn’t spend his money, who was appalled by his books, who drifted\r\naway and away from him, and always if he tried to have it out with her\r\nasked him with patient obstinacy what he thought the things he wrote\r\nand lived by looked in the eyes of God. “No one,” she said once,\r\n“should ever write a book God wouldn’t like to read. That is the test,\r\nFrederick.” And he had laughed hysterically, burst into a great shriek\r\nof laughter, and rushed out of the house, away from her solemn little\r\nface—away from her pathetic, solemn little face. . .\r\n\r\nBut this Rose was his youth again, the best part of his life, the part\r\nof it that had had all the visions in it and all the hopes. How they\r\nhad dreamed together, he and she, before he struck that vein of\r\nmemoirs; how they had planned, and laughed, and loved. They had lived\r\nfor a while in the very heart of poetry. After the happy days came the\r\nhappy nights, the happy, happy nights, with her asleep close against\r\nhis heart, with her when he woke in the morning still close against his\r\nheart, for they hardly moved in their deep, happy sleep. It was\r\nwonderful to have it all come back to him at the touch of her, at the\r\nfeel of her face against his—wonderful that she should be able to give\r\nhim back his youth.\r\n\r\n“Sweetheart—sweetheart,” he murmured, overcome by remembrance, clinging\r\nto her now in his turn.\r\n\r\n“Beloved husband,” she breathed—the bliss of it—the sheer bliss . . .\r\n\r\nBriggs, coming in a few minutes before the gong went on the chance that\r\nLady Caroline might be there, was much astonished. He had supposed Rose\r\nArbuthnot was a widow, and he still supposed it; so that he was much\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n“Well I’m damned,” thought Briggs, quite clearly and distinctly, for\r\nthe shock of what he saw in the window startled him so much that for a\r\nmoment he was shaken free of his own confused absorption.\r\n\r\nAloud he said, very red, “Oh I say—I beg your pardon”—and then stood\r\nhesitating, and wondering whether he oughtn’t to go back to his bedroom\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIf he had said nothing they would not have noticed he was there, but\r\nwhen he begged their pardon Rose turned and looked at him as one looks\r\nwho is trying to remember, and Frederick looked at him too without at\r\nfirst quite seeing him.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t seem, thought Briggs, to mind or to be at all embarrassed.\r\nHe couldn’t be her brother; no brother ever brought that look into a\r\nwoman’s face. It was very awkward. If they didn’t mind, he did. It\r\nupset him to come across his Madonna forgetting herself.\r\n\r\n“Is this one of your friends?” Frederick was able after an instant to\r\nask Rose, who made no attempt to introduce the young man standing\r\nawkwardly in front of them but continued to gaze at him with a kind of\r\nabstracted, radiant goodwill.\r\n\r\n“It’s Mr. Briggs,” said Rose, recognizing him. “This is my husband,”\r\nshe added.\r\n\r\nAnd Briggs, shaking hands, just had time to think how surprising it was\r\nto have a husband when you were a widow before the gong sounded, and\r\nLady Caroline would be there in a minute, and he ceased to be able to\r\nthink at all, and merely became a thing with its eyes fixed on the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThrough the door immediately entered, in what seemed to him an endless\r\nprocession, first Mrs. Fisher, very stately in her evening lace shawl\r\nand brooch, who when she saw him at once relaxed into smiles and\r\nbenignity, only to stiffen, however, when she caught sight of the\r\nstranger; then Mr. Wilkins, cleaner and neater and more carefully\r\ndressed and brushed than any man on earth; and then, tying something\r\nhurriedly as she came, Mrs. Wilkins; and then nobody.\r\n\r\nLady Caroline was late. Where was she? Had she heard the gong? Oughtn’t\r\nit to be beaten again? Suppose she didn’t come to dinner after all. . .\r\n\r\nBriggs went cold.\r\n\r\n“Introduce me,” said Frederick on Mrs. Fisher’s entrance, touching\r\nRose’s elbow.\r\n\r\n“My husband,” said Rose, holding him by the hand, her face exquisite.\r\n\r\n“This,” thought Mrs. Fisher, “must now be the last of the husbands,\r\nunless Lady Caroline produces one from up her sleeve.”\r\n\r\nBut she received him graciously, for he certainly looked exactly like a\r\nhusband, not at all like one of those people who go about abroad\r\npretending they are husbands when they are not, and said she supposed\r\nhe had come to accompany his wife home at the end of the month, and\r\nremarked that now the house would be completely full. “So that,” she\r\nadded, smiling at Briggs, “we shall at last really be getting our\r\nmoney’s worth.”\r\n\r\nBriggs grinned automatically, because he was just able to realise that\r\nsomebody was being playful with him, but he had not heard her and he\r\ndid not look at her. Not only were his eyes fixed on the door but his\r\nwhole body was concentrated on it.\r\n\r\nIntroduced in his turn, Mr. Wilkins was most hospitable and called\r\nFrederick “sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said Mr. Wilkins heartily, “here we are, here we are”—and\r\nhaving gripped his hand with an understanding that only wasn’t mutual\r\nbecause Arbuthnot did not yet know what he was in for in the way of\r\ntrouble, he looked at him as a man should, squarely in the eyes, and\r\nallowed his look to convey as plainly as a look can that in him would\r\nbe found staunchness, integrity, reliability—in fact a friend in need.\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot was very much flushed, Mr. Wilkins noticed. He had not\r\nseen her flushed like that before. “Well, I’m their man,” he thought.\r\n\r\nLotty’s greeting was effusive. It was done with both hands. “Didn’t I\r\ntell you?” she laughed to Rose over her shoulder while Frederick was\r\nshaking her hands in both his.\r\n\r\n“What did you tell her?” asked Frederick, in order to say something.\r\nThe way they were all welcoming him was confusing. They had evidently\r\nall expected him, not only Rose.\r\n\r\nThe sandy but agreeable young woman didn’t answer his question, but\r\nlooked extraordinarily pleased to see him. Why should she be\r\nextraordinarily pleased to see him?\r\n\r\n“What a delightful place this is,” said Frederick, confused, and making\r\nthe first remark that occurred to him.\r\n\r\n“It’s a tub of love,” said the sandy young woman earnestly; which\r\nconfused him more than ever.\r\n\r\nAnd his confusion became excessive at the next words he heard—spoken,\r\nthese, by the old lady, who said: “We won’t wait. Lady Caroline is\r\nalways late”—for he only then, on hearing her name, really and properly\r\nremembered Lady Caroline, and the thought of her confused him to\r\nexcess.\r\n\r\nHe went into the dining-room like a man in a dream. He had come out to\r\nthis place to see Lady Caroline, and had told her so. He had even told\r\nher in his fatuousness—it was true, but how fatuous—that he hadn’t been\r\nable to help coming. She didn’t know he was married. She thought his\r\nname was Arundel. Everybody in London thought his name was Arundel. He\r\nhad used it and written under it so long that he almost thought it was\r\nhimself. In the short time since she had left him on the seat in the\r\ngarden, where he told her he had come because he couldn’t help it, he\r\nhad found Rose again, had passionately embraced and been embraced, and\r\nhad forgotten Lady Caroline. It would be an extraordinary piece of good\r\nfortune if Lady Caroline’s being late meant she was tired or bored and\r\nwould not come to dinner at all. Then he could—no, he couldn’t. He\r\nturned a deeper red even than usual, he being a man of full habit and\r\nred anyhow, at the thought of such cowardice. No, he couldn’t go away\r\nafter dinner and catch his train and disappear to Rome; not unless,\r\nthat is, Rose came with him. But even so, what a running away. No, he\r\ncouldn’t.\r\n\r\nWhen they got to the dining-room Mrs. Fisher went to the head of the\r\ntable—was this Mrs. Fisher’s house? he asked himself. He didn’t know;\r\nhe didn’t know anything—and Rose, who in her earlier days of defying\r\nMrs. Fisher had taken the other end as her place, for after all no one\r\ncould say by looking at a table which was its top and which its bottom,\r\nled Frederick to the seat next to her. If only, he thought, he could\r\nhave been alone with Rose; just five minutes more alone with Rose, so\r\nthat he could have asked her—\r\n\r\nBut probably he wouldn’t have asked her anything, and only gone on\r\nkissing her.\r\n\r\nHe looked round. The sandy young woman was telling the man they called\r\nBriggs to go and sit beside Mrs. Fisher—was the house, then, the sandy\r\nyoung woman’s and not Mrs. Fisher’s? He didn’t know; he didn’t know\r\nanything—and she herself sat down on Rose’s other side, so that she was\r\nopposite him, Frederick, and next to the genial man who had said “Here\r\nwe are,” when it was only too evident that there they were indeed.\r\n\r\nNext to Frederick, and between him and Briggs, was an empty chair: Lady\r\nCaroline’s. No more than Lady Caroline knew of the presence in\r\nFrederick’s life of Rose was Rose aware of the presence in Frederick’s\r\nlife of Lady Caroline. What would each think? He didn’t know; he didn’t\r\nknow anything. Yes, he did know something, and that was that his wife\r\nhad made it up with him—suddenly, miraculously, unaccountably, and\r\ndivinely. Beyond that he knew nothing. The situation was one with which\r\nhe felt he could not cope. It must lead him whither it would. He could\r\nonly drift.\r\n\r\nIn silence Frederick ate his soup, and the eyes, the large expressive\r\neyes of the young woman opposite, were on him, he could feel, with a\r\ngrowing look in them of inquiry. They were, he could see, very\r\nintelligent and attractive eyes, and full, apart from the inquiry of\r\ngoodwill. Probably she thought he ought to talk—but if she knew\r\neverything she wouldn’t think so. Briggs didn’t talk either. Briggs\r\nseemed uneasy. What was the matter with Briggs? And Rose too didn’t\r\ntalk, but then that was natural. She never had been a talker. She had\r\nthe loveliest expression on her face. How long would it be on it after\r\nLady Caroline’s entrance? He didn’t know; he didn’t know anything.\r\n\r\nBut the genial man on Mrs. Fisher’s left was talking enough for\r\neverybody. That fellow ought to have been a parson. Pulpits were the\r\nplace for a voice like his; it would get him a bishopric in six months.\r\nHe was explaining to Briggs, who shuffled about in his seat—why did\r\nBriggs shuffle about in his seat?—that he must have come out by the\r\nsame train as Arbuthnot, and when Briggs, who said nothing, wriggled in\r\napparent dissent, he undertook to prove it to him, and did prove it to\r\nhim in long clear sentences.\r\n\r\n“Who’s the man with the voice?” Frederick asked Rose in a whisper; and\r\nthe young woman opposite, whose ears appeared to have the quickness of\r\nhearing of wild creatures, answered, “He’s my husband.”\r\n\r\n“Then by all the rules,” said Frederick pleasantly, pulling himself\r\ntogether, “you oughtn’t to be sitting next to him.”\r\n\r\n“But I want to. I like sitting next to him. I didn’t before I came\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nFrederick could think of nothing to say to this, so he only smiled\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n“It’s this place,” she said, nodding at him. “It makes one understand.\r\nYou’ve no idea what a lot you’ll understand before you’ve done here.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I hope so,” said Frederick with real fervour.\r\n\r\nThe soup was taken away, and the fish was brought. Briggs, on the other\r\nside of the empty chair, seemed more uneasy than ever. What was the\r\nmatter with Briggs? Didn’t he like fish?\r\n\r\nFrederick wondered what Briggs would do in the way of fidgets if he\r\nwere in his own situation. Frederick kept on wiping his moustache, and\r\nwas not able to look up from his plate, but that was as much as he\r\nshowed of what he was feeling.\r\n\r\nThough he didn’t look up he felt the eyes of the young woman opposite\r\nraking him like searchlights, and Rose’s eyes were on him too, he knew,\r\nbut they rested on him unquestioningly, beautifully, like a\r\nbenediction. How long would they go on doing that once Lady Caroline\r\nwas there? He didn’t know; he didn’t know anything.\r\n\r\nHe wiped his moustache for the twentieth unnecessary time, and could\r\nnot quite keep his hand steady, and the young woman opposite saw his\r\nhand not being quite steady, and her eyes raked him persistently. Why\r\ndid her eyes rake him persistently? He didn’t know; he didn’t know\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nThen Briggs leapt to his feet. What was the matter with Briggs?\r\nOh—yes—quite: she had come.\r\n\r\nFrederick wiped his moustache and got up too. He was in for it now.\r\nAbsurd, fantastic situation. Well, whatever happened he could only\r\ndrift—drift, and look like an ass to Lady Caroline, the most absolute\r\nas well as deceitful ass—an ass who was also a reptile, for she might\r\nwell think he had been mocking her out in the garden when he said, no\r\ndoubt in a shaking voice—fool and ass—that he had come because he\r\ncouldn’t help it; while as for what he would look like to his Rose—when\r\nLady Caroline introduced him to her—when Lady Caroline introduced him\r\nas her friend whom she had invited in to dinner—well, God alone knew\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, as he got up wiped his moustache for the last time\r\nbefore the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nBut he was reckoning without Scrap.\r\n\r\nThat accomplished and experienced young woman slipped into the chair\r\nBriggs was holding for her, and on Lotty’s leaning across eagerly, and\r\nsaying before any one else could get a word in, “Just fancy, Caroline,\r\nhow quickly Rose’s husband has got here!” turned to him without so much\r\nas the faintest shadow of surprise on her face, and held out her hand,\r\nand smiled like a young angel, and said, “and me late your very first\r\nevening.”\r\n\r\nThe daughter of the Droitwiches. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 22\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening was the evening of the full moon. The garden was an\r\nenchanted place where all the flowers seemed white. The lilies, the\r\ndaphnes, the orange-blossom, the white stocks, the white pinks, the\r\nwhite roses—you could see these as plainly as in the day-time; but the\r\ncoloured flowers existed only as fragrance.\r\n\r\nThe three younger women sat on the low wall at the end of the top\r\ngarden after dinner, Rose a little apart from the others, and watched\r\nthe enormous moon moving slowly over the place where Shelley had lived\r\nhis last months just on a hundred years before. The sea quivered along\r\nthe path of the moon. The stars winked and trembled. The mountains were\r\nmisty blue outlines, with little clusters of lights shining through\r\nfrom little clusters of homes. In the garden the plants stood quite\r\nstill, straight and unstirred by the smallest ruffle of air. Through\r\nthe glass doors the dining-room, with its candle-lit table and\r\nbrilliant flowers—nasturtiums and marigolds that night—glowed like some\r\nmagic cave of colour, and the three men smoking round it looked\r\nstrangely animated figures seen from the silence, the huge cool calm of\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher had gone to the drawing-room and the fire. Scrap and Lotty,\r\ntheir faces upturned to the sky, said very little and in whispers. Rose\r\nsaid nothing. Her face too was upturned. She was looking at the\r\numbrella pine, which had been smitten into something glorious,\r\nsilhouetted against stars. Every now and then Scrap’s eyes lingered on\r\nRose; so did Lotty’s. For Rose was lovely. Anywhere at that moment,\r\namong all the well-known beauties, she would have been lovely. Nobody\r\ncould have put her in the shade, blown out her light that evening; she\r\nwas too evidently shining.\r\n\r\nLotty bent close to Scrap’s ear, and whispered. “Love,” she whispered.\r\n\r\nScrap nodded. “Yes,” she said, under her breath.\r\n\r\nShe was obliged to admit it. You only had to look at Rose to know that\r\nhere was Love.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing like it,” whispered Lotty.\r\n\r\nScrap was silent.\r\n\r\n“It’s a great thing,” whispered Lotty after a pause, during which they\r\nboth watched Rose’s upturned face, “to get on with one’s loving.\r\nPerhaps you can tell me of anything else in the world that works such\r\nwonders.”\r\n\r\nBut Scrap couldn’t tell her; and if she could have, what a night to\r\nbegin arguing in. This was a night for—\r\n\r\nShe pulled herself up. Love again. It was everywhere. There was no\r\ngetting away from it. She had come to this place to get away from it,\r\nand here was everybody in its different stages. Even Mrs. Fisher seemed\r\nto have been brushed by one of the many feathers of Love’s wing, and at\r\ndinner was different—full of concern because Mr. Briggs wouldn’t eat,\r\nand her face when she turned to him all soft with motherliness.\r\n\r\nScrap looked up at the pine-tree motionless among stars. Beauty made\r\nyou love, and love made you beautiful. . .\r\n\r\nShe pulled her wrap closer round her with a gesture of defence, of\r\nkeeping out and off. She didn’t want to grow sentimental. Difficult not\r\nto, here; the marvellous night stole in through all one’s chinks, and\r\nbrought in with it, whether one wanted them or not, enormous\r\nfeelings—feelings one couldn’t manage, great things about death and\r\ntime and waste; glorious and devastating things, magnificent and bleak,\r\nat once rapture and terror and immense, heart-cleaving longing. She\r\nfelt small and dreadfully alone. She felt uncovered and defenceless.\r\nInstinctively she pulled her wrap closer. With this thing of chiffon\r\nshe tried to protect herself from the eternities.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” whispered Lotty, “Rose’s husband seems to you just an\r\nordinary, good-natured, middle-aged man.”\r\n\r\nScrap brought her gaze down from the stars and looked at Lotty a moment\r\nwhile she focussed her mind again.\r\n\r\n“Just a rather red, rather round man,” whispered Lotty.\r\n\r\nScrap bowed her head.\r\n\r\n“He isn’t,” whispered Lotty. “Rose sees through all that. That’s mere\r\ntrimmings. She sees what we can’t see, because she loves him.”\r\n\r\nAlways love.\r\n\r\nScrap got up, and winding herself very tightly in her wrap moved away\r\nto her day corner, and sat down there alone on the wall and looked out\r\nacross the other sea, the sea where the sun had gone down, the sea with\r\nthe far-away dim shadow stretching into it which was France.\r\n\r\nYes, love worked wonders, and Mr. Arundel—she couldn’t at once get used\r\nto his other name—was to Rose Love itself; but it also worked inverted\r\nwonders, it didn’t invariably, as she well knew, transfigure people\r\ninto saints and angels. Grievously indeed did it sometimes do the\r\nopposite. She had had it in her life applied to her to excess. If it\r\nhad let her alone, if it had at least been moderate and infrequent, she\r\nmight, she thought, have turned out a quite decent, generous-minded,\r\nkindly, human being. And what was she, thanks to this love Lotty talked\r\nso much about? Scrap searched for a just description. She was a spoilt,\r\na sour, a suspicious, and a selfish spinster.\r\n\r\nThe glass doors of the dining-room opened, and the three men came out\r\ninto the garden, Mr. Wilkins’s voice flowing along in front of them. He\r\nappeared to be doing all the talking; the other two were saying\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she had better go back to Lotty and Rose; it would be tiresome\r\nto be discovered and hemmed into thate _cul-de-sac_ by Mr. Briggs.\r\n\r\nShe got up reluctantly, for she considered it unpardonable of Mr.\r\nBriggs to force her to move about like this, to force her out of any\r\nplace she wished to sit in; and she emerged from the daphne bushes\r\nfeeling like some gaunt, stern figure of just resentment and wishing\r\nthat she looked as gaunt and stern as she felt; so would she have\r\nstruck repugnance into the soul of Mr. Briggs, and been free of him.\r\nBut she knew she didn’t look like that, however hard she might try. At\r\ndinner his hand shook when he drank, and he couldn’t speak to her\r\nwithout flushing scarlet and then going pale, and Mrs. Fisher’s eyes\r\nhad sought hers with the entreaty of one who asks that her only son may\r\nnot be hurt.\r\n\r\nHow could a human being, thought Scrap, frowning as she issued forth\r\nfrom her corner, how could a man made in God’s image behave so; and he\r\nfitted for better things she was sure, with his youth, his\r\nattractiveness, and his brains. He had brains. She had examined him\r\ncautiously whenever at dinner Mrs. Fisher forced him to turn away to\r\nanswer her, and she was sure he had brains. Also he had character;\r\nthere was something noble about his head, about the shape of his\r\nforehead—noble and kind. All the more deplorable that he should allow\r\nhimself to be infatuated by a mere outside, and waste any of his\r\nstrength, any of his peace of mind, hanging round just a woman-thing.\r\nIf only he could see right through her, see through all her skin and\r\nstuff, he would be cured, and she might go on sitting undisturbed on\r\nthis wonderful night by herself.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the daphne bushes she met Frederick, hurrying.\r\n\r\n“I was determined to find you first,” he said, “before I go to Rose.”\r\nAnd he added quickly, “I want to kiss your shoes.”\r\n\r\n“Do you?” said Scrap, smiling. “Then I must go and put on my new ones.\r\nThese aren’t nearly good enough.”\r\n\r\nShe felt immensely well-disposed towards Frederick. He, at least, would\r\ngrab no more. His grabbing days, so sudden and so brief, were done.\r\nNice man; agreeable man. She now definitely liked him. Clearly he had\r\nbeen getting into some sort of a tangle, and she was grateful to Lotty\r\nfor stopping her in time at dinner from saying something hopelessly\r\ncomplicating. But whatever he had been getting into he was out of it\r\nnow; his face and Rose’s face had the same light in them.\r\n\r\n“I shall adore you for ever now,” said Frederick.\r\n\r\nScrap smiled. “Shall you?” she said.\r\n\r\n“I adored you before because of your beauty. Now I adore you because\r\nyou’re not only as beautiful as a dream but as decent as a man.”\r\n\r\nScrap laughed. “Am I?” she said, amused.\r\n\r\n“When the impetuous young woman,” Frederick went on, “the blessedly\r\nimpetuous young woman, blurted out in the nick of time that I am Rose’s\r\nhusband, you behaved exactly as a man would have behaved to his\r\nfriend.”\r\n\r\n“Did I?” said Scrap, her enchanting dimple very evident.\r\n\r\n“It’s the rarest, most precious of combinations,” said Frederick, “to\r\nbe a woman and have the loyalty of a man.”\r\n\r\n“Is it?” smiled Scrap, a little wistfully. These were indeed handsome\r\ncompliments. If only she were really like that . . .\r\n\r\n“And I want to kiss your shoes.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t this save trouble?” she asked, holding out her hand.\r\n\r\nHe took it and swiftly kissed it, and was hurrying away again. “Bless\r\nyou,” he said as he went.\r\n\r\n“Where is your luggage?” Scrap called after him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lord, yes—” said Frederick, pausing. “It’s at the station.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll send for it.”\r\n\r\nHe disappeared through the bushes. She went indoors to give the order;\r\nand this is how it happened that Domenico, for the second time that\r\nevening, found himself journeying into Mezzago and wondering as he\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nThen, having made the necessary arrangements for the perfect happiness\r\nof these two people, she came slowly out into the garden again, very\r\nmuch absorbed in thought. Love seemed to bring happiness to everybody\r\nbut herself. It had certainly got hold of everybody there, in its\r\ndifferent varieties, except herself. Poor Mr. Briggs had been got hold\r\nof by its least dignified variety. Poor Mr. Briggs. He was a disturbing\r\nproblem, and his going away next day wouldn’t she was afraid solve him.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the others Mr. Arundel—she kept on forgetting that he\r\nwasn’t Mr. Arundel—was already, his arm through Rose’s, going off with\r\nher, probably to the greater seclusion of the lower garden. No doubt\r\nthey had a great deal to say to each other; something had gone wrong\r\nbetween them, and had suddenly been put right. San Salvatore, Lotty\r\nwould say, San Salvatore working its spell of happiness. She could\r\nquite believe in its spell. Even she was happier there than she had\r\nbeen for ages and ages. The only person who would go empty away would\r\nbe Mr. Briggs.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Briggs. When she came in sight of the group he looked much too\r\nnice and boyish not to be happy. It seemed out of the picture that the\r\nowner of the place, the person to whom they owed all this, should be\r\nthe only one to go away from it unblessed.\r\n\r\nCompunction seized Scrap. What very pleasant days she had spent in his\r\nhouse, lying in his garden, enjoying his flowers, loving his views,\r\nusing his things, being comfortable, being rested—recovering, in fact.\r\nShe had had the most leisured, peaceful, and thoughtful time of her\r\nlife; and all really thanks to him. Oh, she knew she paid him some\r\nridiculous small sum a week, out of all proportion to the benefits she\r\ngot in exchange, but what was that in the balance? And wasn’t it\r\nentirely thanks to him that she had come across Lotty? Never else would\r\nshe and Lotty have met; never else would she have known her.\r\n\r\nCompunction laid its quick, warm hand on Scrap. Impulsive gratitude\r\nflooded her. She went straight up to Briggs.\r\n\r\n“I owe you so _much_,” she said, overcome by the sudden realisation of\r\nall she did owe him, and ashamed of her churlishness in the afternoon\r\nand at dinner. Of course he hadn’t known she was being churlish. Of\r\ncourse her disagreeable inside was camouflaged as usual by the chance\r\narrangement of her outside; but she knew it. She was churlish. She had\r\nbeen churlish to everybody for years. Any penetrating eye, thought\r\nScrap, any really penetrating eye, would see her for what she was—a\r\nspoilt, a sour, a suspicious and a selfish spinster.\r\n\r\n“I owe you so _much_,” therefore said Scrap earnestly, walking straight\r\nup to Briggs, humbled by these thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in wonder. “_You_ owe _me?_” he said. “But it’s I\r\nwho—I who—” he stammered. To see her there in his garden . . . nothing\r\nin it, no white flower, was whiter, more exquisite.\r\n\r\n“Please,” said Scrap, still more earnestly, “won’t you clear your mind\r\nof everything except just truth? You don’t owe me anything. How should\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t owe you anything?” echoed Briggs. “Why, I owe you my first\r\nsight of—of—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, for goodness sake—for _goodness_ sake,” said Scrap entreatingly,\r\n“do, please, be ordinary. Don’t be humble. Why should you be humble?\r\nIt’s ridiculous of you to be humble. You’re worth fifty of me.”\r\n\r\n“Unwise,” thought Mr. Wilkins, who was standing there too, while Lotty\r\nsat on the wall. He was surprised, he was concerned, he was shocked\r\nthat Lady Caroline should thus encourage Briggs. “Unwise—very,”\r\nthought Mr. Wilkins, shaking his head.\r\n\r\nBriggs’s condition was so bad already that the only course to take with\r\nhim was to repel him utterly, Mr. Wilkins considered. No half measures\r\nwere the least use with Briggs, and kindliness and familiar talk would\r\nonly be misunderstood by the unhappy youth. The daughter of the\r\nDroitwiches could not really, it was impossible to suppose it, desire\r\nto encourage him. Briggs was all very well, but Briggs was Briggs; his\r\nname alone proved that. Probably Lady Caroline did not quite appreciate\r\nthe effect of her voice and face, and how between them they made\r\notherwise ordinary words seem—well, encouraging. But these words were\r\nnot quite ordinary; she had not, he feared, sufficiently pondered them.\r\nIndeed and indeed she needed an adviser—some sagacious, objective\r\ncounsellor like himself. There she was, standing before Briggs almost\r\nholding out her hands to him. Briggs of course ought to be thanked, for\r\nthey were having a most delightful holiday in his house, but not\r\nthanked to excess and not by Lady Caroline alone. That very evening he\r\nhad been considering the presentation to him next day of a round robin\r\nof collective gratitude on his departure; but he should not be thanked\r\nlike this, in the moonlight, in the garden, by the lady he was so\r\nmanifestly infatuated with.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins therefore, desiring to assist Lady Caroline out of this\r\nsituation by swiftly applied tact, said with much heartiness: “It is\r\nmost proper, Briggs, that you should be thanked. You will please allow\r\nme to add my expressions of indebtedness, and those of my wife, to Lady\r\nCaroline’s. We ought to have proposed a vote of thanks to you at\r\ndinner. You should have been toasted. There certainly ought to have\r\nbeen some—”\r\n\r\nBut Briggs took no notice of him whatever; he simply continued to look\r\nat Lady Caroline as though she were the first woman he had ever seen.\r\nNeither, Mr. Wilkins observed, did Lady Caroline take any notice of\r\nhim; she too continued to look at Briggs, and with that odd air of\r\nalmost appeal. Most unwise. Most.\r\n\r\nLotty, on the other hand, took too much notice of him, choosing this\r\nmoment when Lady Caroline needed special support and protection to get\r\nup off the wall and put her arm through his and draw him away.\r\n\r\n“I want to tell you something, Mellersh,” said Lotty at this juncture,\r\ngetting up.\r\n\r\n“Presently,” said Mr. Wilkins, waving her aside.\r\n\r\n“No—now,” said Lotty; and she drew him away.\r\n\r\nHe went with extreme reluctance. Briggs should be given no rope at\r\nall—not an inch.\r\n\r\n“Well—what is it?” he asked impatiently, as she led him towards the\r\nhouse. Lady Caroline ought not to be left like that, exposed to\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but she isn’t,” Lotty assured him, just as if he had said this\r\naloud, which he certainly had not. “Caroline is perfectly all right.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all all right. That young Briggs is—”\r\n\r\n“Of course he is. What did you expect? Let’s go indoors to the fire and\r\nMrs. Fisher. She’s all by herself.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot,” said Mr. Wilkins, trying to draw back, “leave Lady Caroline\r\nalone in the garden.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be silly, Mellersh—she isn’t alone. Besides, I want to tell you\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\n“Well tell me, then.”\r\n\r\n“Indoors.”\r\n\r\nWith a reluctance that increased at every step Mr. Wilkins was taken\r\nfarther and farther away from Lady Caroline. He believed in his wife\r\nnow and trusted her, but on this occasion he thought she was making a\r\nterrible mistake. In the drawing-room sat Mrs. Fisher by the fire, and\r\nit certainly was to Mr. Wilkins, who preferred rooms and fires after\r\ndark to gardens and moonlight, more agreeable to be in there than\r\nout-of-doors if he could have brought Lady Caroline safely in with him.\r\nAs it was, he went in with extreme reluctance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher, her hands folded on her lap, was doing nothing, merely\r\ngazing fixedly into the fire. The lamp was arranged conveniently for\r\nreading, but she was not reading. Her great dead friends did not seem\r\nworth reading that night. They always said the same things now—over and\r\nover again they said the same things, and nothing new was to be got out\r\nof them any more for ever. No doubt they were greater than any one was\r\nnow, but they had this immense disadvantage, that they were dead.\r\nNothing further was to be expected of them; while of the living, what\r\nmight one not still expect? She craved for the living, the\r\ndeveloping—the crystallised and finished wearied her. She was thinking\r\nthat if only she had had a son—a son like Mr. Briggs, a dear boy like\r\nthat, going on, unfolding, alive, affectionate, taking care of her and\r\nloving her. . .\r\n\r\nThe look on her face gave Mrs. Wilkins’s heart a little twist when she\r\nsaw it. “Poor old dear,” she thought, all the loneliness of age\r\nflashing upon her, the loneliness of having outstayed one’s welcome in\r\nthe world, of being in it only on sufferance, the complete loneliness\r\nof the old childless woman who has failed to make friends. It did seem\r\nthat people could only be really happy in pairs—any sorts of pairs, not\r\nin the least necessarily lovers, but pairs of friends, pairs of mothers\r\nand children, of brothers and sisters—and where was the other half of\r\nMrs. Fisher’s pair going to be found?\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins thought she had perhaps better kiss her again. The kissing\r\nthis afternoon had been a great success; she knew it, she had instantly\r\nfelt Mrs. Fisher’s reaction to it. So she crossed over and bent down\r\nand kissed her and said cheerfully, “We’ve come in—” which indeed was\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nThis time Mrs. Fisher actually put up her hand and held Mrs. Wilkins’s\r\ncheek against her own—this living thing, full of affection, of warm,\r\nracing blood; and as she did this she felt safe with the strange\r\ncreature, sure that she who herself did unusual things so naturally\r\nwould take the action quite as a matter of course, and not embarrass\r\nher by being surprised.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins was not at all surprised; she was delighted. “I believe\r\n_I’m_ the other half of her pair,” flashed into her mind. “I believe\r\nit’s me, positively me, going to be fast friends with Mrs. Fisher!”\r\n\r\nHer face when she lifted her head was full of laughter. Too\r\nextraordinary, the developments produced by San Salvatore. She and Mrs.\r\nFisher . . . but she _saw_ them being fast friends.\r\n\r\n“Where are the others?” asked Mrs. Fisher. “Thank you—dear,” she added,\r\nas Mrs. Wilkins put a footstool under her feet, a footstool obviously\r\nneeded, Mrs. Fisher’s legs being short.\r\n\r\n“I see myself throughout the years,” thought Mrs. Wilkins, her eyes\r\ndancing, “bringing footstools to Mrs. Fisher. . .”\r\n\r\n“The Roses,” she said, straightening herself, “have gone into the lower\r\ngarden—I _think_ lovemaking.”\r\n\r\n“The Roses?”\r\n\r\n“The Fredericks, then, if you like. They’re completely merged and\r\nindistinguishable.”\r\n\r\n“Why not say the Arbuthnots, my dear?” said Mr. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Very well, Mellersh—the Arbuthnots. And the Carolines—”\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Wilkins and Mrs. Fisher started. Mr. Wilkins, usually in such\r\ncomplete control of himself, started even more than Mrs. Fisher, and\r\nfor the first time since his arrival felt angry with his wife.\r\n\r\n“Really—” he began indignantly.\r\n\r\n“Very well, Mellersh—the Briggses, then.”\r\n\r\n“The Briggses!” cried Mr. Wilkins, now very angry indeed; for the\r\nimplication was to him a most outrageous insult to the entire race of\r\nDesters—dead Desters, living Desters, and Desters still harmless\r\nbecause they were yet unborn. “Really—”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Mellersh,” said Mrs. Wilkins, pretending meekness, “if you\r\ndon’t like it.”\r\n\r\n“Like it! You’ve taken leave of your senses. Why, they’ve never set\r\neyes on each other before to-day.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true. But that’s why they’re able now to go ahead.”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead!” Mr. Wilkins could only echo the outrageous words.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Mellersh,” said Mrs. Wilkins again, “if you don’t like it,\r\nbut—”\r\n\r\nHer grey eyes shone, and her face rippled with the light and conviction\r\nthat had so much surprised Rose the first time they met.\r\n\r\n“It’s useless minding,” she said. “I shouldn’t struggle if I were you.\r\nBecause—”\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and looked first at one alarmed solemn face and then at\r\nthe other, and laughter as well as light flickered and danced over her.\r\n\r\n“I see them being the Briggses,” finished Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\nThat last week the syringa came out at San Salvatore, and all the\r\nacacias flowered. No one had noticed how many acacias there were till\r\none day the garden was full of a new scent, and there were the delicate\r\ntrees, the lovely successors to the wistaria, hung all over among their\r\ntrembling leaves with blossom. To lie under an acacia tree that last\r\nweek and look up through the branches at its frail leaves and white\r\nflowers quivering against the blue of the sky, while the least movement\r\nof the air shook down their scent, was a great happiness. Indeed, the\r\nwhole garden dressed itself gradually towards the end in white, and\r\ngrew more and more scented. There were the lilies, as vigorous as ever,\r\nand the white stocks and white pinks and white banksia roses, and the\r\nsyringa and the jessamine, and at last the crowning fragrance of the\r\nacacias.
