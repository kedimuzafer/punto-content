{"text": "MOBY (tm) LANGUAGE II DOCUMENTATION NOTES\n\nThis documentation, the software and/or database are:\n\nPublic Domain material by grant from the author, January, 2001.\n\nHISTORICAL NOTE:\n\nThe Ward word lists were some of the largest public domain word lists\nin the world, at the time they were added to the Project Gutenberg\ncollection in 2007. These word lists do not contain 8-bit accented\ncharacters or Unicode, as would be found in a more recent Project\nGutenberg eBook. Instead, the lists include phonetic spelling,\nutilizing backslashes and other characters to indicate where accents\nwould normally occur. There is no detailed guide on how these extra\ncharacters were used, and therefore it is likely infeasible to map from\nthe word lists back to a correct representation of the word (i.e., to\nmap from a word list entry with slashes or other characters, back to\nthe actual non-English word with accents or other non-ASCII characters).\n\nThese lists may still be useful, but they are no longer the\nstate-of-the-art in word lists. In the time since the lists were\ncreated, it has become much easier for anyone with interests to make\ntheir own lists of unique words from the Project Gutenberg collection\nor other sources.\n\nMoby (tm) Language II for MSDOS operating systems is compressed\nand distributed as a single zip file.
