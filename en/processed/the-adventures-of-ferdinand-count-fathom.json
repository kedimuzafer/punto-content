Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, writing to her\ndaughter, the Countess of Bute, over a year later [January 1st, 1755],\nremarked that “my friend Smollett . . . has certainly a talent for\ninvention, though I think it flags a little in his last work.” Lady\nMary was both right and wrong. The inventive power which we commonly\nthink of as Smollett’s was the ability to work over his own experience\ninto realistic fiction. Of this, Ferdinand Count Fathom shows\ncomparatively little. It shows relatively little, too, of Smollett’s\nvigorous personality, which in his earlier works was present to give\nlife and interest to almost every chapter, were it to describe a street\nbrawl, a ludicrous situation, a whimsical character, or with venomous\nprejudice to gibbet some enemy. This individuality—the peculiar spirit\nof the author which can be felt rather than described—is present in the\ndedication of Fathom to Doctor ———, who is no other than Smollett\nhimself, and a candid revelation of his character, by the way, this\ndedication contains. It is present, too, in the opening chapters, which\nshow, likewise, in the picture of Fathom’s mother, something of the\nauthor’s peculiar “talent for invention.” Subsequently, however, there\nis no denying that the Smollett invention and the Smollett spirit both\nflag. And yet, in a way, Fathom displays more invention than any of the\nauthor’s novels; it is based far less than any other on personal\nexperience. Unfortunately such thorough-going invention was not suited\nto Smollett’s genius. The result is, that while uninteresting as a\nnovel of contemporary manners, Fathom has an interest of its own in\nthat it reveals a new side of its author. We think of Smollett,\ngenerally, as a rambling storyteller, a rational, unromantic man of the\nworld, who fills his pages with his own oddly-metamorphosed\nacquaintances and experiences. The Smollett of Count Fathom, on the\ncontrary, is rather a forerunner of the romantic school, who has\ncreated a tolerably organic tale of adventure out of his own brain.\nThough this is notably less readable than the author’s earlier works,\nstill the wonder is that when the man is so far “off his beat,” he\nshould yet know so well how to meet the strange conditions which\nconfront him. To one whose idea of Smollett’s genius is formed entirely\nby Random and Pickle and Humphry Clinker, Ferdinand Count Fathom will\noffer many surprises.\n\nThe first of these is the comparative lifelessness of the book. True,\nhere again are action and incident galore, but generally unaccompanied\nby that rough Georgian hurly-burly, common in Smollett, which is so\ninteresting to contemplate from a comfortable distance, and which goes\nso far towards making his fiction seem real. Nor are the characters,\nfor the most part, life-like enough to be interesting. There is an\napparent exception, to be sure, in the hero’s mother, already\nmentioned, the hardened camp-follower, whom we confidently expect to\nbecome vitalised after the savage fashion of Smollett’s characters.\nBut, alas! we have no chance to learn the lady’s style of conversation,\nfor the few words that come from her lips are but partially\ncharacteristic; we have only too little chance to learn her manners and\ncustoms. In the fourth chapter, while she is making sure with her\ndagger that all those on the field of battle whom she wishes to rifle\nare really dead, an officer of the hussars, who has been watching her\nlucrative progress, unfeelingly puts a brace of bullets into the lady’s\nbrain, just as she raises her hand to smite him to the heart. Perhaps\nit is as well that she is thus removed before our disappointment at the\nnon-fulfilment of her promise becomes poignant. So far as we may judge\nfrom the other personages of Count Fathom, even this interesting Amazon\nwould sooner or later have turned into a wooden figure, with a label\ngiving the necessary information as to her character.\n\nSuch certainly is her son, Fathom, the hero of the book. Because he is\nplacarded, “Shrewd villain of monstrous inhumanity,” we are fain to\naccept him for what his creator intended; but seldom in word or deed is\nhe a convincingly real villain. His friend and foil, the noble young\nCount de Melvil, is no more alive than he; and equally wooden are\nJoshua, the high-minded, saint-like Jew, and that tedious, foolish Don\nDiego. Neither is the heroine alive, the peerless Monimia, but then, in\nher case, want of vitality is not surprising; the presence of it would\namaze us. If she were a woman throbbing with life, she would be\ndifferent from Smollett’s other heroines. The “second lady” of the\nmelodrama, Mademoiselle de Melvil, though by no means vivified, is yet\nmore real than her sister-in-law.\n\nThe fact that they are mostly inanimate figures is not the only\nsurprise given us by the personages of Count Fathom. It is a surprise\nto find few of them strikingly whimsical; it is a surprise to find them\nin some cases far more distinctly conceived than any of the people in\nRoderick Random or Peregrine Pickle. In the second of these, we saw\nSmollett beginning to understand the use of incident to indicate\nconsistent development of character. In Count Fathom, he seems fully to\nunderstand this principle of art, though he has not learned to apply it\nsuccessfully. And so, in spite of an excellent conception, Fathom, as I\nhave said, is unreal. After all his villainies, which he perpetrates\nwithout any apparent qualms of conscience, it is incredible that he\nshould honestly repent of his crimes. We are much inclined to doubt\nwhen we read that “his vice and ambition was now quite mortified within\nhim,” the subsequent testimony of Matthew Bramble, Esq., in Humphry\nClinker, to the contrary, notwithstanding. Yet Fathom up to this point\nis consistently drawn, and drawn for a purpose:—to show that\ncold-blooded roguery, though successful for a while, will come to grief\nin the end. To heighten the effect of his scoundrel, Smollett develops\nparallel with him the virtuous Count de Melvil. The author’s scheme of\nthus using one character as the foil of another, though not conspicuous\nfor its originality, shows a decided advance in the theory of\nconstructive technique. Only, as I have said, Smollett’s execution is\nnow defective.\n\n“But,” one will naturally ask, “if Fathom lacks the amusing, and not\ninfrequently stimulating, hurly-burly of Smollett’s former novels; if\nits characters, though well-conceived, are seldom divertingly fantastic\nand never thoroughly animate; what makes the book interesting?” The\nsurprise will be greater than ever when the answer is given that, to a\nlarge extent, the plot makes Fathom interesting. Yes, Smollett,\nhitherto indifferent to structure, has here written a story in which\nthe plot itself, often clumsy though it may be, engages a reader’s\nattention. One actually wants to know whether the young Count is ever\ngoing to receive consolation for his sorrows and inflict justice on his\nbasely ungrateful pensioner. And when, finally, all turns out as it\nshould, one is amazed to find how many of the people in the book have\nhelped towards the designed conclusion. Not all of them, indeed, nor\nall of the adventures, are indispensable, but it is manifest at the end\nthat much, which, for the time, most readers think irrelevant—such as\nDon Diego’s history—is, after all, essential.\n\nIt has already been said that in Count Fathom Smollett appears to some\nextent as a romanticist, and this is another fact which lends interest\nto the book. That he had a powerful imagination is not a surprise. Any\none versed in Smollett has already seen it in the remarkable situations\nwhich he has put before us in his earlier works. These do not indicate,\nhowever, that Smollett possessed the imagination which could excite\nromantic interest; for in Roderick Random and in Peregrine Pickle, the\nwonderful situations serve chiefly to amuse. In Fathom, however, there\nare some designed to excite horror; and one, at least, is eminently\nsuccessful. The hero’s night in the wood between Bar-le-duc and Chalons\nwas no doubt more blood-curdling to our eighteenth-century ancestors\nthan it is to us, who have become acquainted with scores of similar\nsituations in the small number of exciting romances which belong to\nliterature, and in the greater number which do not. Still, even to-day,\na reader, with his taste jaded by trashy novels, will be conscious of\nSmollett’s power, and of several thrills, likewise, as he reads about\nFathom’s experience in the loft in which the beldame locks him to pass\nthe night.\n\nThis situation is melodramatic rather than romantic, as the word is\nused technically in application to eighteenth and nineteenth-century\nliterature. There is no little in Fathom, however, which is genuinely\nromantic in the latter sense. Such is the imprisonment of the Countess\nin the castle-tower, whence she waves her handkerchief to the young\nCount, her son and would-be rescuer. And especially so is the scene in\nthe church, when Renaldo (the very name is romantic) visits at midnight\nthe supposed grave of his lady-love. While he was waiting for the\nsexton to open the door, his “soul . . . was wound up to the highest\npitch of enthusiastic sorrow. The uncommon darkness, . . . the solemn\nsilence, and lonely situation of the place, conspired with the occasion\nof his coming, and the dismal images of his fancy, to produce a real\nrapture of gloomy expectation, which the whole world could not have\npersuaded him to disappoint. The clock struck twelve, the owl screeched\nfrom the ruined battlement, the door was opened by the sexton, who, by\nthe light of a glimmering taper, conducted the despairing lover to a\ndreary aisle, and stamped upon the ground with his foot, saying, ‘Here\nthe young lady lies interred.’”\n\nWe have here such an amount of the usual romantic machinery of the\n“grave-yard” school of poets—that school of which Professor W. L.\nPhelps calls Young, in his Night Thoughts, the most “conspicuous\nexemplar”—that one is at first inclined to think Smollett poking fun at\nit. The context, however, seems to prove that he was perfectly serious.\nIt is interesting, then, as well as surprising, to find traces of the\nromantic spirit in his fiction over ten years before Walpole’s Castle\nof Otranto. It is also interesting to find so much melodramatic feeling\nin him, because it makes stronger the connection between him and his\nnineteenth-century disciple, Dickens.\n\nFrom all that I have said, it must not be thought that the usual\nSmollett is always, or almost always, absent from Count Fathom. I have\nspoken of the dedication and of the opening chapters as what we might\nexpect from his pen. There are, besides, true Smollett strokes in the\nscenes in the prison from which Melvil rescues Fathom, and there is a\ngood deal of the satirical Smollett fun in the description of Fathom’s\nups and downs, first as the petted beau, and then as the fashionable\ndoctor. In chronicling the latter meteoric career, Smollett had already\nobserved the peculiarity of his countrymen which Thackeray was fond of\nharping on in the next century—“the maxim which universally prevails\namong the English people . . . to overlook, . . . on their return to\nthe metropolis, all the connexions they may have chanced to acquire\nduring their residence at any of the medical wells. And this social\ndisposition is so scrupulously maintained, that two persons who live in\nthe most intimate correspondence at Bath or Tunbridge, shall, in\nfour-and-twenty hours . . . meet in St. James’s Park, without betraying\nthe least token of recognition.” And good, too, is the way in which, as\nDr. Fathom goes rapidly down the social hill, he makes excuses for his\ndeclining splendour. His chariot was overturned “with a hideous crash”\nat such danger to himself, “that he did not believe he should ever\nhazard himself again in any sort of wheel carriage.” He turned off his\nmen for maids, because “men servants are generally impudent, lazy,\ndebauched, or dishonest.” To avoid the din of the street, he shifted\nhis lodgings into a quiet, obscure court. And so forth and so on, in\nthe true Smollett vein.\n\nBut, after all, such of the old sparks are struck only occasionally.\nApart from its plot, which not a few nineteenth-century writers of\ndetective-stories might have improved, The Adventures of Ferdinand\nCount Fathom is less interesting for itself than any other piece of\nfiction from Smollett’s pen. For a student of Smollett, however, it is\nhighly interesting as showing the author’s romantic, melodramatic\ntendencies, and the growth of his constructive technique.\n\nG. H. MAYNADIER\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF FERDINAND COUNT FATHOM\n\nTO DOCTOR ———\n\nYou and I, my good friend, have often deliberated on the difficulty of\nwriting such a dedication as might gratify the self-complacency of a\npatron, without exposing the author to the ridicule or censure of the\npublic; and I think we generally agreed that the task was altogether\nimpracticable.—Indeed, this was one of the few subjects on which we\nhave always thought in the same manner. For, notwithstanding that\ndeference and regard which we mutually pay to each other, certain it\nis, we have often differed, according to the predominancy of those\ndifferent passions, which frequently warp the opinion, and perplex the\nunderstanding of the most judicious.\n\nIn dedication, as in poetry, there is no medium; for, if any one of the\nhuman virtues be omitted in the enumeration of the patron’s good\nqualities, the whole address is construed into an affront, and the\nwriter has the mortification to find his praise prostituted to very\nlittle purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, should he yield to the transports of gratitude or\naffection, which is always apt to exaggerate, and produce no more than\nthe genuine effusions of his heart, the world will make no allowance\nfor the warmth of his passion, but ascribe the praise he bestows to\ninterested views and sordid adulation.\n\nSometimes too, dazzled by the tinsel of a character which he has no\nopportunity to investigate, he pours forth the homage of his admiration\nupon some false Maecenas, whose future conduct gives the lie to his\neulogium, and involves him in shame and confusion of face. Such was the\nfate of a late ingenious author [the Author of the “Seasons”], who was\nso often put to the blush for the undeserved incense he had offered in\nthe heat of an enthusiastic disposition, misled by popular applause,\nthat he had resolved to retract, in his last will, all the encomiums\nwhich he had thus prematurely bestowed, and stigmatise the unworthy by\nname—a laudable scheme of poetical justice, the execution of which was\nfatally prevented by untimely death.\n\nWhatever may have been the fate of other dedicators, I, for my own\npart, sit down to write this address, without any apprehension of\ndisgrace or disappointment; because I know you are too well convinced\nof my affection and sincerity to repine at what I shall say touching\nyour character and conduct. And you will do me the justice to believe,\nthat this public distinction is a testimony of my particular friendship\nand esteem.\n\nNot that I am either insensible of your infirmities, or disposed to\nconceal them from the notice of mankind. There are certain foibles\nwhich can only be cured by shame and mortification; and whether or not\nyours be of that species, I shall have the comfort to think my best\nendeavours were used for your reformation.\n\nKnow then, I can despise your pride, while I honour your integrity, and\napplaud your taste, while I am shocked at your ostentation.—I have\nknown you trifling, superficial, and obstinate in dispute; meanly\njealous and awkwardly reserved; rash and haughty in your resentments;\nand coarse and lowly in your connexions. I have blushed at the weakness\nof your conversation, and trembled at the errors of your conduct—yet,\nas I own you possess certain good qualities, which overbalance these\ndefects, and distinguish you on this occasion as a person for whom I\nhave the most perfect attachment and esteem, you have no cause to\ncomplain of the indelicacy with which your faults are reprehended. And\nas they are chiefly the excesses of a sanguine disposition and\nlooseness of thought, impatient of caution or control, you may, thus\nstimulated, watch over your own intemperance and infirmity with\nredoubled vigilance and consideration, and for the future profit by the\nseverity of my reproof.\n\nThese, however, are not the only motives that induce me to trouble you\nwith this public application. I must not only perform my duty to my\nfriends, but also discharge the debt I owe to my own interest. We live\nin a censorious age; and an author cannot take too much precaution to\nanticipate the prejudice, misapprehension, and temerity of malice,\nignorance, and presumption.\n\nI therefore think it incumbent upon me to give some previous intimation\nof the plan which I have executed in the subsequent performance, that I\nmay not be condemned upon partial evidence; and to whom can I with more\npropriety appeal in my explanation than to you, who are so well\nacquainted with all the sentiments and emotions of my breast?\n\nA novel is a large diffused picture, comprehending the characters of\nlife, disposed in different groups, and exhibited in various attitudes,\nfor the purposes of an uniform plan, and general occurrence, to which\nevery individual figure is subservient. But this plan cannot be\nexecuted with propriety, probability, or success, without a principal\npersonage to attract the attention, unite the incidents, unwind the\nclue of the labyrinth, and at last close the scene, by virtue of his\nown importance.\n\nAlmost all the heroes of this kind, who have hitherto succeeded on the\nEnglish stage, are characters of transcendent worth, conducted through\nthe vicissitudes of fortune, to that goal of happiness, which ever\nought to be the repose of extraordinary desert.—Yet the same principle\nby which we rejoice at the remuneration of merit, will teach us to\nrelish the disgrace and discomfiture of vice, which is always an\nexample of extensive use and influence, because it leaves a deep\nimpression of terror upon the minds of those who were not confirmed in\nthe pursuit of morality and virtue, and, while the balance wavers,\nenables the right scale to preponderate.\n\nIn the drama, which is a more limited field of invention, the chief\npersonage is often the object of our detestation and abhorrence; and we\nare as well pleased to see the wicked schemes of a Richard blasted, and\nthe perfidy of a Maskwell exposed, as to behold a Bevil happy, and an\nEdward victorious.\n\nThe impulses of fear, which is the most violent and interesting of all\nthe passions, remain longer than any other upon the memory; and for one\nthat is allured to virtue, by the contemplation of that peace and\nhappiness which it bestows, a hundred are deterred from the practice of\nvice, by that infamy and punishment to which it is liable, from the\nlaws and regulations of mankind.\n\nLet me not, therefore, be condemned for having chosen my principal\ncharacter from the purlieus of treachery and fraud, when I declare my\npurpose is to set him up as a beacon for the benefit of the\nunexperienced and unwary, who, from the perusal of these memoirs, may\nlearn to avoid the manifold snares with which they are continually\nsurrounded in the paths of life; while those who hesitate on the brink\nof iniquity may be terrified from plunging into that irremediable gulf,\nby surveying the deplorable fate of Ferdinand Count Fathom.\n\nThat the mind might not be fatigued, nor the imagination disgusted, by\na succession of vicious objects, I have endeavoured to refresh the\nattention with occasional incidents of a different nature; and raised\nup a virtuous character, in opposition to the adventurer, with a view\nto amuse the fancy, engage the affection, and form a striking contrast\nwhich might heighten the expression, and give a relief to the moral of\nthe whole.\n\nIf I have not succeeded in my endeavours to unfold the mysteries of\nfraud, to instruct the ignorant, and entertain the vacant; if I have\nfailed in my attempts to subject folly to ridicule, and vice to\nindignation; to rouse the spirit of mirth, wake the soul of compassion,\nand touch the secret springs that move the heart; I have, at least,\nadorned virtue with honour and applause, branded iniquity with reproach\nand shame, and carefully avoided every hint or expression which could\ngive umbrage to the most delicate reader—circumstances which (whatever\nmay be my fate with the public) will with you always operate in favour\nof,\n\nDear sir, your very affectionate friend and servant,\n\nTHE AUTHOR.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nSOME SAGE OBSERVATIONS THAT NATURALLY INTRODUCE OUR IMPORTANT HISTORY.\n\nCardinal de Retz very judiciously observes, that all historians must of\nnecessity be subject to mistakes, in explaining the motives of those\nactions they record, unless they derive their intelligence from the\ncandid confession of the person whose character they represent; and\nthat, of consequence, every man of importance ought to write his own\nmemoirs, provided he has honesty enough to tell the truth, without\nsuppressing any circumstance that may tend to the information of the\nreader. This, however, is a requisite that, I am afraid, would be very\nrarely found among the number of those who exhibit their own portraits\nto the public. Indeed, I will venture to say, that, how upright soever\na man’s intentions may be, he will, in the performance of such a task,\nbe sometimes misled by his own phantasy, and represent objects, as they\nappeared to him, through the mists of prejudice and passion.\n\nAn unconcerned reader, when he peruses the history of two competitors,\nwho lived two thousand years ago, or who perhaps never had existence,\nexcept in the imagination of the author, cannot help interesting\nhimself in the dispute, and espousing one side of the contest, with all\nthe zeal of a warm adherent. What wonder, then, that we should be\nheated in our own concerns, review our actions with the same\nself-approbation that they had formerly acquired, and recommend them to\nthe world with all the enthusiasm of paternal affection?\n\nSupposing this to be the case, it was lucky for the cause of historical\ntruth, that so many pens have been drawn by writers, who could not be\nsuspected of such partiality; and that many great personages, among the\nancients as well as moderns, either would not or could not entertain\nthe public with their own memoirs. From this want of inclination or\ncapacity to write, in our hero himself, the undertaking is now left to\nme, of transmitting to posterity the remarkable adventures of FERDINAND\nCOUNT FATHOM; and by the time the reader shall have glanced over the\nsubsequent sheets, I doubt not but he will bless God that the\nadventurer was not his own historian.\n\nThis mirror of modern chivalry was none of those who owe their dignity\nto the circumstances of their birth, and are consecrated from the\ncradle for the purposes of greatness, merely because they are the\naccidental children of wealth. He was heir to no visible patrimony,\nunless we reckon a robust constitution, a tolerable appearance, and an\nuncommon capacity, as the advantages of inheritance. If the comparison\nobtains in this point of consideration, he was as much as any man\nindebted to his parent; and pity it was, that, in the sequel of his\nfortune, he never had an opportunity of manifesting his filial\ngratitude and regard. From this agreeable act of duty to his sire, and\nall those tendernesses that are reciprocally enjoyed betwixt the father\nand the son, he was unhappily excluded by a small circumstance; at\nwhich, however, he was never heard to repine. In short, had he been\nbrought forth in the fabulous ages of the world, the nature of his\norigin might have turned to his account; he might, like other heroes of\nantiquity, have laid claim to divine extraction, without running the\nrisk of being claimed by an earthly father. Not that his parents had\nany reason to disown or renounce their offspring, or that there was\nanything preternatural in the circumstances of his generation and\nbirth; on the contrary, he was, from the beginning, a child of\npromising parts, and in due course of nature ushered into the world\namidst a whole cloud of witnesses. But, that he was acknowledged by no\nmortal sire, solely proceeded from the uncertainty of his mother, whose\naffections were so dissipated among a number of admirers, that she\ncould never pitch upon the person from whose loins our hero sprung.\n\nOver and above this important doubt under which he was begotten, other\nparticularities attended his birth, and seemed to mark him out as\nsomething uncommon among the sons of men. He was brought forth in a\nwaggon, and might be said to be literally a native of two different\ncountries; for, though he first saw the light in Holland, he was not\nborn till after the carriage arrived in Flanders; so that, all these\nextraordinary circumstances considered, the task of determining to what\ngovernment he naturally owed allegiance, would be at least as difficult\nas that of ascertaining the so much contested birthplace of Homer.\n\nCertain it is, the Count’s mother was an Englishwoman, who, after\nhaving been five times a widow in one campaign, was, in the last year\nof the renowned Marlborough’s command, numbered among the baggage of\nthe allied army, which she still accompanied, through pure benevolence\nof spirit, supplying the ranks with the refreshing streams of choice\nGeneva, and accommodating individuals with clean linen, as the\nemergency of their occasions required. Nor was her philanthropy\naltogether confined to such ministration; she abounded with “the milk\nof human kindness,” which flowed plentifully among her\nfellow-creatures; and to every son of Mars who cultivated her favour,\nshe liberally dispensed her smiles, in order to sweeten the toils and\ndangers of the field.\n\nAnd here it will not be amiss to anticipate the remarks of the reader,\nwho, in the chastity and excellency of his conception, may possibly\nexclaim, “Good Heaven! will these authors never reform their\nimaginations, and lift their ideas from the obscene objects of low\nlife? Must the public be again disgusted with the grovelling adventures\nof a waggon? Will no writer of genius draw his pen in the vindication\nof taste, and entertain us with the agreeable characters, the dignified\nconversation, the poignant repartee, in short, the genteel comedy of\nthe polite world?”\n\nHave a little patience, gentle, delicate, sublime critic; you, I doubt\nnot, are one of those consummate connoisseurs, who, in their\npurifications, let humour evaporate, while they endeavour to preserve\ndecorum, and polish wit, until the edge of it is quite worn off. Or,\nperhaps, of that class, who, in the sapience of taste, are disgusted\nwith those very flavours in the productions of their own country which\nhave yielded infinite delectation to their faculties, when imported\nfrom another clime; and d—n an author in despite of all precedent and\nprescription;—who extol the writings of Petronius Arbiter, read with\nrapture the amorous sallies of Ovid’s pen, and chuckle over the story\nof Lucian’s ass; yet, if a modern author presumes to relate the\nprogress of a simple intrigue, are shocked at the indecency and\nimmorality of the scene;—who delight in following Guzman d’Alfarache,\nthrough all the mazes of squalid beggary; who with pleasure accompany\nDon Quixote and his squire, in the lowest paths of fortune; who are\ndiverted with the adventures of Scarron’s ragged troop of strollers,\nand highly entertained with the servile situations of Gil Blas; yet,\nwhen a character in humble life occasionally occurs in a performance of\nour own growth, exclaim, with an air of disgust, “Was ever anything so\nmean! sure, this writer must have been very conversant with the lowest\nscenes of life;”—who, when Swift or Pope represents a coxcomb in the\nact of swearing, scruple not to laugh at the ridiculous execrations;\nbut, in a less reputed author, condemn the use of such profane\nexpletives;—who eagerly explore the jakes of Rabelais, for amusement,\nand even extract humour from the dean’s description of a lady’s\ndressing-room; yet in a production of these days, unstamped with such\nvenerable names, will stop their noses, with all the signs of loathing\nand abhorrence, at a bare mention of the china chamber-pot;—who\napplauded Catullus, Juvenal, Persius, and Lucan, for their spirit in\nlashing the greatest names of antiquity; yet, when a British satirist,\nof this generation, has courage enough to call in question the talents\nof a pseudo-patron in power, accuse him of insolence, rancour, and\nscurrility.\n\nIf such you be, courteous reader, I say again, have a little patience;\nfor your entertainment we are about to write. Our hero shall, with all\nconvenient despatch, be gradually sublimed into those splendid\nconnexions of which you are enamoured; and God forbid, that, in the\nmeantime, the nature of his extraction should turn to his prejudice in\na land of freedom like this, where individuals are every day ennobled\nin consequence of their own qualifications, without the least\nretrospective regard to the rank or merit of their ancestors. Yes,\nrefined reader, we are hastening to that goal of perfection, where\nsatire dares not show her face; where nature is castigated, almost even\nto still life; where humour turns changeling, and slavers in an insipid\ngrin; where wit is volatilised into a mere vapour; where decency,\ndivested of all substance, hovers about like a fantastic shadow; where\nthe salt of genius, escaping, leaves nothing but pure and simple\nphlegm; and the inoffensive pen for ever drops the mild manna of\nsoul-sweetening praise.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nA SUPERFICIAL VIEW OF OUR HERO’S INFANCY.\n\nHaving thus bespoken the indulgence of our guests, let us now produce\nthe particulars of our entertainment, and speedily conduct our\nadventurer through the stage of infancy, which seldom teems with\ninteresting incidents.\n\nAs the occupations of his mother would not conveniently permit her to\nsuckle this her firstborn at her own breast, and those happy ages were\nnow no more, in which the charge of nursing a child might be left to\nthe next goat or she-wolf, she resolved to improve upon the ordinances\nof nature, and foster him with a juice much more energetic than the\nmilk of goat, wolf, or woman; this was no other than that delicious\nnectar, which, as we have already hinted, she so cordially distributed\nfrom a small cask that hung before her, depending from her shoulders by\na leathern zone. Thus determined, ere he was yet twelve days old, she\nenclosed him in a canvas knapsack, which being adjusted to her neck,\nfell down upon her back, and balanced the cargo that rested on her\nbosom.\n\nThere are not wanting those who affirm, that, while her double charge\nwas carried about in this situation, her keg was furnished with a long\nand slender flexible tube, which, when the child began to be clamorous,\nshe conveyed into his mouth, and straight he stilled himself with\nsucking; but this we consider as an extravagant assertion of those who\nmix the marvellous in all their narrations, because we cannot conceive\nhow the tender organs of an infant could digest such a fiery beverage,\nwhich never fails to discompose the constitutions of the most hardy and\nrobust. We therefore conclude that the use of this potation was more\nrestrained, and that it was with simple element diluted into a\ncomposition adapted to his taste and years. Be this as it will, he\ncertainly was indulged in the use of it to such a degree as would have\neffectually obstructed his future fortune, had not he been happily\ncloyed with the repetition of the same fare, for which he conceived the\nutmost detestation and abhorrence, rejecting it with loathing and\ndisgust, like those choice spirits, who, having been crammed with\nreligion in their childhood, renounce it in their youth, among other\nabsurd prejudices of education.\n\nWhile he was thus dangled in a state of suspension, a German trooper\nwas transiently smit with the charms of his mother, who listened to his\nhonourable addresses, and once more received the silken bonds of\nmatrimony; the ceremony having been performed as usual at the\ndrum-head. The lady had no sooner taken possession of her new name,\nthan she bestowed it upon her son, who was thenceforward distinguished\nby the appellation of Ferdinand de Fadom; nor was the husband offended\nat this presumption in his wife, which he not only considered as a\nproof of her affection and esteem, but also as a compliment, by which\nhe might in time acquire the credit of being the real father of such a\nhopeful child.\n\nNotwithstanding this new engagement with a foreigner, our hero’s mother\nstill exercised the virtues of her calling among the English troops, so\nmuch was she biassed by that laudable partiality, which, as Horace\nobserves, the natale solum generally inspires. Indeed this inclination\nwas enforced by another reason, that did not fail to influence her\nconduct in this particular; all her knowledge of the High Dutch\nlanguage consisted in some words of traffic absolutely necessary for\nthe practice of her vocation, together with sundry oaths and terms of\nreproach, that kept her customers in awe; so that, except among her own\ncountrymen, she could not indulge that propensity to conversation, for\nwhich she had been remarkable from her earliest years. Nor did this\ninstance of her affection fail of turning to her account in the sequel.\nShe was promoted to the office of cook to a regimental mess of\nofficers; and, before the peace of Utrecht, was actually in possession\nof a suttling-tent, pitched for the accommodation of the gentlemen in\nthe army.\n\nMeanwhile, Ferdinand improved apace in the accomplishments of infancy;\nhis beauty was conspicuous, and his vigour so uncommon, that he was\nwith justice likened unto Hercules in the cradle. The friends of his\nfather-in-law dandled him on their knees, while he played with their\nwhiskers, and, before he was thirteen months old, taught him to suck\nbrandy impregnated with gunpowder, through the touch-hole of a pistol.\nAt the same time, he was caressed by divers serjeants of the British\narmy, who severally and in secret contemplated his qualifications with\na father’s pride, excited by the artful declaration with which the\nmother had flattered each apart.\n\nSoon as the war was (for her unhappily) concluded, she, as in duty\nbound, followed her husband into Bohemia; and his regiment being sent\ninto garrison at Prague, she opened a cabaret in that city, which was\nfrequented by a good many guests of the Scotch and Irish nations, who\nwere devoted to the exercise of arms in the service of the Emperor. It\nwas by this communication that the English tongue became vernacular to\nyoung Ferdinand, who, without such opportunity, would have been a\nstranger to the language of his forefathers, in spite of all his\nmother’s loquacity and elocution; though it must be owned, for the\ncredit of her maternal care, that she let slip no occasion of making it\nfamiliar to his ear and conception; for, even at those intervals in\nwhich she could find no person to carry on the altercation, she used to\nhold forth in earnest soliloquies upon the subject of her own\nsituation, giving vent to many opprobrious invectives against her\nhusband’s country, between which and Old England she drew many odious\ncomparisons; and prayed, without ceasing, that Europe might speedily be\ninvolved in a general war, so as that she might have some chance of\nre-enjoying the pleasures and emoluments of a Flanders campaign.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nHE IS INITIATED IN A MILITARY LIFE, AND HAS THE GOOD FORTUNE TO ACQUIRE\nA GENEROUS PATRON.\n\nWhile she wearied Heaven with these petitions, the flame of war broke\nout betwixt the houses of Ottoman and Austria, and the Emperor sent\nforth an army into Hungary, under the auspices of the renowned Prince\nEugene. On account of this expedition, the mother of our hero gave up\nhousekeeping, and cheerfully followed her customers and husband into\nthe field; having first provided herself with store of those\ncommodities in which she had formerly merchandised. Although the hope\nof profit might in some measure affect her determination, one of the\nchief motives for her visiting the frontiers of Turkey, was the desire\nof initiating her son in the rudiments of his education, which she now\nthought high time to inculcate, he being, at this period, in the sixth\nyear of his age; he was accordingly conducted to the camp, which she\nconsidered as the most consummate school of life, and proposed for the\nscene of his instruction; and in this academy he had not continued many\nweeks, when he was an eye-witness of that famous victory, which, with\nsixty thousand men, the Imperial general obtained over an army of one\nhundred and fifty thousand Turks.\n\nHis father-in-law was engaged, and his mother would not be idle on this\noccasion. She was a perfect mistress of all the camp qualifications,\nand thought it a duty incumbent on her to contribute all that lay in\nher power towards distressing the enemy. With these sentiments she\nhovered about the skirts of the army, and the troops were no sooner\nemployed in the pursuit, than she began to traverse the field of battle\nwith a poignard and a bag, in order to consult her own interest, annoy\nthe foe, and exercise her humanity at the same time. In short, she had,\nwith amazing prowess, delivered some fifty or threescore disabled\nMussulmen of the pain under which they groaned, and made a comfortable\nbooty of the spoils of the slain, when her eyes were attracted by the\nrich attire of an Imperial officer, who lay bleeding on the plain, to\nall appearance in the agonies of death.\n\nShe could not in her heart refuse that favour to a friend and Christian\nshe had so compassionately bestowed upon so many enemies and infidels,\nand therefore drew near with the sovereign remedy, which she had\nalready administered with such success. As she approached this\ndeplorable object of pity, her ears were surprised with an ejaculation\nin the English tongue, which he fervently pronounced, though with a\nweak and languid voice, recommending his soul to God, and his family to\nthe protection of Heaven. Our Amazon’s purpose was staggered by this\nprovidential incident; the sound of her native language, so\nunexpectedly heard, and so pathetically delivered, had a surprising\neffect upon her imagination; and the faculty of reflection did not\nforsake her in such emergency. Though she could not recollect the\nfeatures of this unhappy officer, she concluded, from his appearance,\nthat he was some person of distinction in the service, and foresaw\ngreater advantage to herself in attempting to preserve his life, than\nshe could possibly reap from the execution of her first resolve. “If,”\nsaid she to herself, “I can find means of conveying him to his tent\nalive, he cannot but in conscience acknowledge my humanity with some\nconsiderable recompense; and, should he chance to survive his wounds, I\nhave everything to expect from his gratitude and power.”\n\nFraught with these prudential suggestions, she drew near the\nunfortunate stranger, and, in a softened accent of pity and condolence,\nquestioned him concerning his name, condition, and the nature of his\nmischance, at the same time making a gentle tender of her service.\nAgreeably surprised to hear himself accosted in such a manner, by a\nperson whose equipage seemed to promise far other designs, he thanked\nher in the most grateful terms for her humanity, with the appellation\nof kind countrywoman; gave her to understand that he was colonel of a\nregiment of horse; that he had fallen in consequence of a shot he\nreceived in his breast at the beginning of the action; and, finally,\nentreated her to procure some carriage on which he might be removed to\nhis tent. Perceiving him faint and exhausted with loss of blood, she\nraised up his head, and treated him with that cordial which was her\nconstant companion. At that instant, espying a small body of hussars\nreturning to the camp with the plunder they had taken, she invoked\ntheir assistance, and they forthwith carried the officer to his own\nquarters, where his wound was dressed, and his preserver carefully\ntended him until his recovery was completed.\n\nIn return for these good offices, this gentleman, who was originally of\nScotland, rewarded her for the present with great liberality, assured\nher of his influence in promoting her husband, and took upon himself\nthe charge of young Ferdinand’s education; the boy was immediately\ntaken into his protection, and entered as a trooper in his own\nregiment; but his good intentions towards his father-in-law were\nfrustrated by the death of the German, who, in a few days after this\ndisposition, was shot in the trenches before Temiswaer.\n\nThis event, over and above the conjugal affliction with which it\ninvaded the lady’s quiet, would have involved her in infinite\ndifficulty and distress, with regard to her temporal concerns, by\nleaving her unprotected in the midst of strangers, had not she been\nthus providentially supplied with an effectual patron in the colonel,\nwho was known by the appellation of Count Melvil. He no sooner saw her,\nby the death of her husband, detached from all personal connexions with\na military life, than he proposed that she should quit her occupation\nin the camp, and retire to his habitation in the city of Presburg,\nwhere she would be entertained in ease and plenty during the remaining\npart of her natural life. With all due acknowledgments of his\ngenerosity, she begged to be excused from embracing his proposal,\nalleging she was so much accustomed to her present way of life, and so\nmuch devoted to the service of the soldiery, that she should never be\nhappy in retirement, while the troops of any prince in Christendom kept\nthe field.\n\nThe Count, finding her determined to prosecute her scheme, repeated his\npromise of befriending her upon all occasions; and in the meantime\nadmitted Ferdinand into the number of his domestics, resolving that he\nshould be brought up in attendance upon his own son, who was a boy of\nthe same age. He kept him, however, in his tent, until he should have\nan opportunity of revisiting his family in person; and, before that\noccasion offered, two whole years elapsed, during which the illustrious\nPrince Eugene gained the celebrated battle of Belgrade, and afterwards\nmade himself master of that important frontier.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nHIS MOTHER’S PROWESS AND DEATH; TOGETHER WITH SOME INSTANCES OF HIS OWN\nSAGACITY.\n\nIt would have been impossible for the mother of our adventurer, such as\nshe hath been described, to sit quietly in her tent, while such an\nheroic scene was acting. She was no sooner apprised of the general’s\nintention to attack the enemy, than she, as usual, packed up her\nmoveables in a waggon, which she committed to the care of a peasant in\nthe neighbourhood, and put herself in motion with the troops; big with\nthe expectation of re-acting that part in which she had formerly\nacquitted herself so much to her advantage.—Nay, she by this time\nlooked upon her own presence as a certain omen of success to the cause\nwhich she espoused; and, in their march to battle, actually encouraged\nthe ranks with repeated declarations, importing, that she had been\neye-witness of ten decisive engagements, in all of which her friends\nhad been victorious, and imputing such uncommon good fortune to some\nsupernatural quality inherent in her person.\n\nWhether or not this confidence contributed to the fortune of the day,\nby inspiring the soldiers to an uncommon pitch of courage and\nresolution, I shall not pretend to determine. But, certain it is, the\nvictory began from that quarter in which she had posted herself; and no\ncorps in the army behaved with such intrepidity as that which was\nmanifested by those who were favoured with her admonitions and example;\nfor she not only exposed her person to the enemy’s fire, with the\nindifference and deliberation of a veteran, but she is said to have\nachieved a very conspicuous exploit by the prowess of her single arm.\nThe extremity of the line to which she had attached herself, being\nassaulted in flank by a body of the spahis, wheeled about, in order to\nsustain the charge, and received them with such a seasonable fire, as\nbrought a great number of turbans to the ground; among those who fell,\nwas one of the chiefs or agas, who had advanced before the rest, with a\nview to signalise his valour.\n\nOur English Penthesilea no sooner saw this Turkish leader drop, than,\nstruck with the magnificence of his own and horse’s trappings, she\nsprung forward to seize them as her prize, and found the aga not dead,\nthough in a good measure disabled by his misfortune, which was entirely\nowing to the weight of his horse, that, having been killed by a\nmusket-ball, lay upon his leg, so that he could not disengage himself.\nNevertheless, perceiving the virago approach with fell intent, he\nbrandished his symitar, and tried to intimidate his assailant with a\nmost horrible exclamation; but it was not the dismal yell of a\ndismounted cavalier, though enforced with a hideous ferocity of\ncountenance, and the menacing gestures with which he waited her\napproach, that could intimidate such an undaunted she-campaigner; she\nsaw him writhing in the agonies of a situation from which he could not\nmove; and, running towards him with the nimbleness and intrepidity of a\nCamilla, described a semicircle in the progress of her assault, and\nattacking him on one side, plunged her well-tried dagger in his throat.\nThe shades of death encompassed him, his life-blood issued at the\nwound, he fell prone upon the earth, he bit the dust, and having thrice\ninvoked the name of Allah! straight expired.\n\nWhile his destiny was thus fulfilled, his followers began to reel; they\nseemed dismayed at the fate of their chief, beheld their companions\ndrop like the leaves in autumn, and suddenly halted in the midst of\ntheir career. The Imperialists, observing the confusion of the enemy,\nredoubled their fire; and, raising a dreadful shout, advanced in order\nto improve the advantage they had gained. The spahis durst not wait the\nshock of such an encounter; they wheeled to the right-about, and\nclapping spurs to their horses, fled in the utmost disorder. This was\nactually the circumstance that turned the scale of battle. The\nAustrians pursued their good fortune with uncommon impetuosity, and in\na few minutes left the field clear for the mother of our hero, who was\nsuch an adept in the art of stripping, that in the twinkling of an eye\nthe bodies of the aga and his Arabian lay naked to the skin. It would\nhave been happy for her, had she been contented with these\nfirst-fruits, reaped from the fortune of the day, and retired with her\nspoils, which were not inconsiderable; but, intoxicated with the glory\nshe had won, enticed by the glittering caparisons that lay scattered on\nthe plain, and without doubt prompted by the secret instinct of her\nfate, she resolved to seize opportunity by the forelock, and once for\nall indemnify herself for the many fatigues, hazards, and sorrows she\nhad undergone.\n\nThus determined, she reconnoitred the field, and practised her address\nso successfully, that in less than half an hour she was loaded with\nermine and embroidery, and disposed to retreat with her burden, when\nher regards were solicited by a splendid bundle, which she descried at\nsome distance lying on the ground. This was no other than an unhappy\nofficer of hussars; who, after having the good fortune to take a\nTurkish standard, was desperately wounded in the thigh, and obliged to\nquit his horse; finding himself in such a helpless condition, he had\nwrapped his acquisition round his body, that whatever might happen, he\nand his glory should not be parted; and thus shrouded, among the dying\nand the dead, he had observed the progress of our heroine, who stalked\nabout the field, like another Atropos, finishing, wherever she came,\nthe work of death. He did not at all doubt, that he himself would be\nvisited in the course of her peregrinations, and therefore provided for\nher reception, with a pistol ready cocked in his hand, while he lay\nperdue beneath his covert, in all appearance bereft of life. He was not\ndeceived in his prognostic; she no sooner eyed the golden crescent\nthan, inflamed with curiosity or cupidity, she directed thitherward her\nsteps, and discerning the carcase of a man, from which, she thought,\nthere would be a necessity for disengaging it, she lifted up her\nweapon, in order to make sure of her purchase; and in the very instant\nof discharging her blow, received a brace of bullets in her brain.\n\nThus ended the mortal pilgrimage of this modern Amazon; who, in point\nof courage, was not inferior to Semiramis, Tomyris, Zenobia,\nThalestris, or any boasted heroine of ancient times. It cannot be\nsupposed that this catastrophe made a very deep impression upon the\nmind of young Ferdinand, who had just then attained the ninth year of\nhis age, and been for a considerable time weaned from her maternal\ncaresses; especially as he felt no wants nor grievances in the family\nof the Count, who favoured him with a particular share of indulgence,\nbecause he perceived in him a spirit of docility, insinuation, and\nsagacity, far above his years. He did not, however, fail to lament the\nuntimely fate of his mother, with such filial expressions of sorrow, as\nstill more intimately recommended him to his patron; who, being himself\na man of extraordinary benevolence, looked upon the boy as a prodigy of\nnatural affection, and foresaw in his future services a fund of\ngratitude and attachment, that could not fail to render him a valuable\nacquisition to his family.\n\nIn his own country, he had often seen connexions of that sort, which\nhaving been planted in the infancy of the adherent, had grown up to a\nsurprising pitch of fidelity and friendship, that no temptation could\nbias, and no danger dissolve. He therefore rejoiced in the hope of\nseeing his own son accommodated with such a faithful attendant, in the\nperson of young Fathom, on whom he resolved to bestow the same\neducation he had planned for the other, though conveyed in such a\nmanner as should be suitable to the sphere in which he was ordained to\nmove. In consequence of these determinations, our young adventurer led\na very easy life, in quality of page to the Count, in whose tent he lay\nupon a pallet, close to his field-bed, and often diverted him with his\nchildish prattle in the English tongue, which the more seldom his\nmaster had occasion to speak, he the more delighted to hear. In the\nexercise of his function, the boy was incredibly assiduous and alert;\nfar from neglecting the little particulars of his duty, and embarking\nin the mischievous amusements of the children belonging to the camp, he\nwas always diligent, sedate, agreeably officious and anticipating; and\nin the whole of his behaviour seemed to express the most vigilant sense\nof his patron’s goodness and generosity; nay, to such a degree had\nthese sentiments, in all appearance, operated upon his reflection, that\none morning, while he supposed the Count asleep, he crept softly to his\nbedside, and gently kissing his hand, which happened to be uncovered,\npronounced, in a low voice, a most fervent prayer in his behalf,\nbeseeching Heaven to shower down blessings upon him, as the widow’s\nfriend and the orphan’s father. This benediction was not lost upon the\nCount, who chanced to be awake, and heard it with admiration; but what\nriveted Ferdinand in his good graces, was a discovery that our youth\nmade, while his master was upon duty in the trenches before Belgrade.\n\nTwo foot soldiers, standing sentry near the door of the tent, were\ncaptivated with the sight of some valuable moveables belonging to it;\nand supposing, in their great wisdom, that the city of Belgrade was too\nwell fortified to be taken during that campaign, they came to a\nresolution of withdrawing themselves from the severe service of the\ntrenches, by deserting to the enemy, after they should have rifled\nCount Melvil’s tent of the furniture by which they were so powerfully\nallured. The particulars of this plan were concerted in the French\nlanguage, which, they imagined, would screen them from all risk of\nbeing detected, in case they should be overheard, though, as there was\nno living creature in sight, they had no reason to believe that any\nperson was privy to their conversation. Nevertheless, they were\nmistaken in both these conjectures. The conference reached the ears of\nFathom, who was at the other end of the tent, and had perceived the\neager looks with which they considered some parts of the furniture. He\nhad penetration enough to suspect their desire, and, alarmed by that\nsuspicion, listened attentively to their discourse; which, from a\nslender knowledge in the French tongue, he had the good fortune partly\nto understand.\n\nThis important piece of intelligence he communicated to the Count at\nhis return, and measures were immediately taken to defeat the design,\nand make an example of the authors, who being permitted to load\nthemselves with the booty, were apprehended in their retreat, and\npunished with death according to their demerits.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nA BRIEF DETAIL OF HIS EDUCATION.\n\nNothing could have more seasonably happened to confirm the good opinion\nwhich the colonel entertained of Ferdinand’s principles. His intentions\ntowards the boy grew every day more and more warm; and, immediately\nafter the peace of Passarowitz, he retired to his own house at\nPresburg, and presented young Fathom to his lady, not only as the son\nof a person to whom he owed his life, but also as a lad who merited his\npeculiar protection and regard by his own personal virtue. The\nCountess, who was an Hungarian, received him with great kindness and\naffability, and her son was ravished with the prospect of enjoying such\na companion. In short, fortune seemed to have provided for him an\nasylum, in which he might be safely trained up, and suitably prepared\nfor more important scenes of life than any of his ancestors had ever\nknown.\n\nHe was not, in all respects, entertained on the footing of his young\nmaster; yet he shared in all his education and amusements, as one whom\nthe old gentleman was fully determined to qualify for the station of an\nofficer in the service; and, if he did not eat with the Count, he was\nevery day regaled with choice bits from his table; holding, as it were,\na middle place between the rank of a relation and favourite domestic.\nAlthough his patron maintained a tutor in the house, to superintend the\nconduct of his heir, he committed the charge of his learning to the\ninstructions of a public school; where he imagined the boy would imbibe\na laudable spirit of emulation among his fellows, which could not fail\nof turning out to the advantage of his education. Ferdinand was entered\nin the same academy; and the two lads proceeded equally in the paths of\nerudition; a mutual friendship and intimacy soon ensued, and,\nnotwithstanding the levity and caprice commonly discernible in the\nbehaviour of such boys, very few or rather no quarrels happened in the\ncourse of their communication. Yet their dispositions were altogether\ndifferent, and their talents unlike. Nay, this dissimilarity was the\nvery bond of their union; because it prevented that jealousy and\nrivalship which often interrupts the harmony of two warm\ncontemporaries.\n\nThe young Count made extraordinary progress in the exercises of the\nschool, though he seemed to take very little pains in the cultivation\nof his studies; and became a perfect hero in all the athletic\ndiversions of his fellow-scholars; but, at the same time, exhibited\nsuch a bashful appearance and uncouth address, that his mother\ndespaired of ever seeing him improved into any degree of polite\nbehaviour. On the other hand, Fathom, who was in point of learning a\nmere dunce, became, even in his childhood, remarkable among the ladies\nfor his genteel deportment and vivacity; they admired the proficiency\nhe made under the directions of his dancing-master, the air with which\nhe performed his obeisance at his entrance and exit; and were charmed\nwith the agreeable assurance and lively sallies of his conversation;\nwhile they expressed the utmost concern and disgust at the boorish\ndemeanour of his companion, whose extorted bows resembled the pawings\nof a mule, who hung his head in silence like a detected sheep-stealer,\nwho sat in company under the most awkward expressions of constraint,\nand whose discourse never exceeded the simple monosyllables of negation\nand assent.\n\nIn vain did all the females of the family propose to him young Fathom,\nas a pattern and reproach. He remained unaltered by all their efforts\nand expostulations, and allowed our adventurer to enjoy the triumph of\nhis praise, while he himself was conscious of his own superiority in\nthose qualifications which seemed of more real importance than the mere\nexteriors and forms of life. His present ambition was not to make a\nfigure at his father’s table, but to eclipse his rivals at school, and\nto acquire an influence and authority among these confederates.\nNevertheless, Fathom might possibly have fallen under his displeasure\nor contempt, had not that pliant genius found means to retain his\nfriendship by seasonable compliances and submission; for the sole\nstudy, or at least the chief aim of Ferdinand, was to make himself\nnecessary and agreeable to those on whom his dependence was placed. His\ntalent was in this particular suited to his inclination; he seemed to\nhave inherited it from his mother’s womb; and, without all doubt, would\nhave raised upon it a most admirable superstructure of fortune and\napplause, had not it been inseparably yoked with a most insidious\nprinciple of self-love, that grew up with him from the cradle, and left\nno room in his heart for the least particle of social virtue. This\nlast, however, he knew so well how to counterfeit, by means of a large\nshare of ductility and dissimulation, that, surely, he was calculated\nby nature to dupe even the most cautious, and gratify his appetites, by\nlevying contributions on all mankind.\n\nSo little are the common instructors of youth qualified to judge the\ncapacities of those who are under their tutelage and care, that Fathom,\nby dint of his insinuating arts, made shift to pass upon the\nschoolmaster as a lad of quick parts, in despite of a natural\ninaptitude to retain his lessons, which all his industry could never\novercome. In order to remedy, or rather to cloak this defect in his\nunderstanding, he had always recourse to the friendship of the young\nCount, who freely permitted him to transcribe his exercises, until a\nsmall accident happened, which had well-nigh put a stop to these\ninstances of his generosity.—The adventure, inconsiderable as it is, we\nshall record, as the first overt act of Ferdinand’s true character, as\nwell as an illustration of the opinion we have advanced touching the\nblind and injudicious decisions of a right pedagogue.\n\nAmong other tasks imposed by the pedant upon the form to which our two\ncompanions belonged, they were one evening ordered to translate a\nchapter of Caesar’s Commentaries. Accordingly the young Count went to\nwork, and performed the undertaking with great elegance and despatch.\nFathom, having spent the night in more effeminate amusements, was next\nmorning so much hurried for want of time, that in his transcription he\nneglected to insert a few variations from the text, these being the\nterms on which he was allowed to use it; so that it was verbatim a copy\nof the original. As those exercises were always delivered in a heap,\nsubscribed with the several names of the boys to whom they belonged,\nthe schoolmaster chanced to peruse the version of Ferdinand, before he\nlooked into any of the rest, and could not help bestowing upon it\nparticular marks of approbation. The next that fell under his\nexamination was that of the young Count, when he immediately perceived\nthe sameness, and, far from imputing it to the true cause, upbraided\nhim with having copied the exercise of our adventurer, and insisted\nupon chastising him upon the spot for his want of application.\n\nHad not the young gentleman thought his honour was concerned, he would\nhave submitted to the punishment without murmuring; but he inherited,\nfrom his parents, the pride of two fierce nations, and, being\noverwhelmed with reproaches for that which he imagined ought to have\nredounded to his glory, he could not brook the indignity, and boldly\naffirmed, that he himself was the original, to whom Ferdinand was\nbeholden for his performance. The schoolmaster, nettled to find himself\nmistaken in his judgment, resolved that the Count should have no cause\nto exult in the discovery he had made, and, like a true flogger,\nactually whipped him for having allowed Fathom to copy his exercise.\nNay, in the hope of vindicating his own penetration, he took an\nopportunity of questioning Ferdinand in private concerning the\ncircumstances of the translation, and our hero, perceiving his drift,\ngave him such artful and ambiguous answers, as persuaded him that the\nyoung Count had acted the part of a plagiary, and that the other had\nbeen restrained from doing himself justice, by the consideration of his\nown dependence.\n\nThis profound director did not fail, in honour of his own discernment,\nto whisper about the misrepresentation, as an instance of the young\nCount’s insolence, and Fathom’s humility and good sense. The story was\ncirculated among the servants, especially the maids belonging to the\nfamily, whose favour our hero had acquired by his engaging behaviour;\nand at length it reached the ears of his patron, who, incensed at his\nson’s presumption and inhospitality, called him to a severe account,\nwhen the young gentleman absolutely denied the truth of the allegation,\nand appealed to the evidence of Fathom himself. Our adventurer was\naccordingly summoned by the father, and encouraged to declare the\ntruth, with an assurance of his constant protection; upon which\nFerdinand very wisely fell upon his knees, and, while the tears gushed\nfrom his eyes, acquitted the young Count of the imputation, and\nexpressed his apprehension, that the report had been spread by some of\nhis enemies, who wanted to prejudice him in the opinion of his patron.\n\nThe old gentleman was not satisfied of his son’s integrity by this\ndeclaration; being naturally of a generous disposition, highly\nprepossessed in favour of the poor orphan, and chagrined at the\nunpromising appearance of his heir, he suspected that Fathom was\noverawed by the fear of giving offence, and that, notwithstanding what\nhe had said, the case really stood as it had been represented. In this\npersuasion, he earnestly exhorted his son to resist and combat with any\nimpulse he might feel within himself, tending to selfishness, fraud, or\nimposition; to encourage every sentiment of candour and benevolence,\nand to behave with moderation and affability to all his\nfellow-creatures. He laid upon him strong injunctions, not without a\nmixture of threats, to consider Fathom as the object of his peculiar\nregard; to respect him as the son of the Count’s preserver, as a\nBriton, a stranger, and, above all, an helpless orphan, to whom the\nrights of hospitality were doubly due.\n\nSuch admonitions were not lost upon the youth, who, under the rough\nhusk of his personal exhibition, possessed a large share of generous\nsensibility. Without any formal professions to his father, he resolved\nto govern himself according to his remonstrances; and, far from\nconceiving the least spark of animosity against Fathom, he looked upon\nthe poor boy as the innocent cause of his disgrace, and redoubled his\nkindness towards him, that his honour might never again be called in\nquestion, upon the same subject. Nothing is more liable to\nmisconstruction than an act of uncommon generosity; one half of the\nworld mistake the motive, from want of ideas to conceive an instance of\nbeneficence that soars so high above the level of their own sentiments;\nand the rest suspect it of something sinister or selfish, from the\nsuggestions of their own sordid and vicious inclinations. The young\nCount subjected himself to such misinterpretation, among those who\nobserved the increased warmth of civility and complaisance in his\nbehaviour to Ferdinand. They ascribed it to his desire of still\nprofiting by our adventurer’s superior talents, by which alone they\nsupposed him enabled to maintain any degree of reputation at school; or\nto the fear of being convicted by him of some misdemeanour of which he\nknew himself guilty. These suspicions were not effaced by the conduct\nof Ferdinand, who, when examined on the subject, managed his answers in\nsuch a manner, as confirmed their conjectures, while he pretended to\nrefute them, and at the same time acquired to himself credit for his\nextraordinary discretion and self-denial.\n\nIf he exhibited such a proof of sagacity in the twelfth year of his\nage, what might not be expected from his finesse in the maturity of his\nfaculties and experience? Thus secured in the good graces of the whole\nfamily, he saw the days of his puerility glide along in the most\nagreeable elapse of caresses and amusement. He never fairly plunged\ninto the stream of school-education, but, by floating on the surface,\nimbibed a small tincture of those different sciences which his master\npretended to teach. In short, he resembled those vagrant swallows that\nskim along the level of some pool or river, without venturing to wet\none feather in their wings, except in the accidental pursuit of an\ninconsiderable fly. Yet, though his capacity or inclination was\nunsuited for studies of this kind, he did not fail to manifest a\nperfect genius in the acquisition of other more profitable arts. Over\nand above the accomplishments of address, for which he hath been\nalready celebrated, he excelled all his fellows in his dexterity at\nfives and billiards; was altogether unrivalled in his skill at draughts\nand backgammon; began, even at these years, to understand the moves and\nschemes of chess; and made himself a mere adept in the mystery of\ncards, which he learned in the course of his assiduities and attention\nto the females of the house.\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\nHE MEDITATES SCHEMES OF IMPORTANCE.\n\nIt was in these parties that he attracted the notice and friendship of\nhis patron’s daughter, a girl by two years older than himself, who was\nnot insensible to his qualifications, and looked upon him with the most\nfavourable eyes of prepossession. Whether or not he at this period of\nhis life began to project plans for availing himself of her\nsusceptibility, is uncertain; but, without all doubt, he cultivated her\nesteem with as obsequious and submissive attention as if he had already\nformed the design, which, in his advanced age, he attempted to put in\nexecution.\n\nDivers circumstances conspired to promote him in the favour of this\nyoung lady; the greenness of his years secured him from any appearance\nof fallacious aim; so that he was indulged in frequent opportunities of\nconversing with his young mistress, whose parents encouraged this\ncommunication, by which they hoped she would improve in speaking the\nlanguage of her father. Such connexions naturally produce intimacy and\nfriendship. Fathom’s person was agreeable, his talents calculated for\nthe meridian of those parties, and his manners so engaging, that there\nwould have been no just subject for wonder, had he made an impression\nupon the tender unexperienced heart of Mademoiselle de Melvil, whose\nbeauty was not so attractive as to extinguish his hope, in raising up a\nnumber of formidable rivals; though her expectations of fortune were\nsuch as commonly lend additional lustre to personal merit.\n\nAll these considerations were so many steps towards the success of\nFerdinand’s pretensions; and though he cannot be supposed to have\nperceived them at first, he in the sequel seemed perfectly well\napprised of his advantages, and used them to the full extent of his\nfaculties. Observing that she delighted in music, he betook himself to\nthe study of that art, and, by dint of application and a tolerable ear,\nlearned of himself to accompany her with a German flute, while she sung\nand played upon the harpsichord. The Count, seeing his inclination, and\nthe progress he had made, resolved that his capacity should not be lost\nfor want of cultivation; and accordingly provided him with a master, by\nwhom he was instructed in the principles of the art, and soon became a\nproficient in playing upon the violin.\n\nIn the practice of these improvements and avocations, and in attendance\nupon his young master, whom he took care never to disoblige or neglect,\nhe attained to the age of sixteen, without feeling the least abatement\nin the friendship and generosity of those upon whom he depended; but,\non the contrary, receiving every day fresh marks of their bounty and\nregard. He had before this time been smit with the ambition of making a\nconquest of the young lady’s heart, and foresaw manifold advantages to\nhimself in becoming son-in-law to Count Melvil, who, he never doubted,\nwould soon be reconciled to the match, if once it could be effectuated\nwithout his knowledge. Although he thought he had great reason to\nbelieve that Mademoiselle looked upon him with an eye of peculiar\nfavour, his disposition was happily tempered with an ingredient of\ncaution, that hindered him from acting with precipitation; and he had\ndiscerned in the young lady’s deportment certain indications of\nloftiness and pride, which kept him in the utmost vigilance and\ncircumspection; for he knew, that, by a premature declaration, he\nshould run the risk of forfeiting all the advantages he had gained, and\nblasting those expectations that now blossomed so gaily in his heart.\n\nRestricted by these reflections, he acted at a wary distance, and\ndetermined to proceed by the method of sap, and, summoning all his\nartifice and attractions to his aid, employed them under the insidious\ncover of profound respect, in order to undermine those bulwarks of\nhaughtiness or discretion, which otherwise might have rendered his\napproaches to her impracticable. With a view to enhance the value of\nhis company, and sound her sentiments at the same time, he became more\nreserved than usual, and seldomer engaged in her parties of music and\ncards; yet, in the midst of his reserve, he never failed in those\ndemonstrations of reverence and regard, which he knew perfectly well\nhow to express, but devised such excuses for his absence, as she could\nnot help admitting. In consequence of this affected shyness, she more\nthan once gently chid him for his neglect and indifference, observing,\nwith an ironical air, that he was now too much of a man to be\nentertained with such effeminate diversions; but her reproofs were\npronounced with too much ease and good-humour to be agreeable to our\nhero, who desired to see her ruffled and chagrined at his absence, and\nto hear himself rebuked with an angry affectation of disdain. This\neffort, therefore, he reinforced with the most captivating carriage he\ncould assume, in those hours which he now so sparingly bestowed upon\nhis mistress. He regaled her with all the entertaining stories he could\nlearn or invent, particularly such as he thought would justify and\nrecommend the levelling power of love, that knows no distinctions of\nfortune. He sung nothing but tender airs and passionate complaints,\ncomposed by desponding or despairing swains; and, to render his\nperformances of this kind the more pathetic, interlarded them with some\nseasonable sighs, while the tears, which he had ever at command, stood\ncollected in either eye.\n\nIt was impossible for her to overlook such studied emotions; she in a\njocose manner taxed him with having lost his heart, rallied the excess\nof his passion, and in a merry strain undertook to be an advocate for\nhis love. Her behaviour was still wide of his wish and expectation. He\nthought she would, in consequence of her discovery, have betrayed some\ninterested symptom; that her face would have undergone some favourable\nsuffusion; that her tongue would have faltered, her breast heaved, and\nher whole deportment betokened internal agitation and disorder, in\nwhich case, he meant to profit by the happy impression, and declare\nhimself, before she could possibly recollect the dictates of her\npride.—Baffled however in his endeavours, by the serenity of the young\nlady, which he still deemed equivocal, he had recourse to another\nexperiment, by which he believed he should make a discovery of her\nsentiments beyond all possibility of doubt. One day, while he\naccompanied Mademoiselle in her exercise of music, he pretended all of\na sudden to be taken ill, and counterfeited a swoon in her apartment.\nSurprised at this accident, she screamed aloud, but far from running to\nhis assistance, with the transports and distraction of a lover, she\nordered her maid, who was present, to support his head, and went in\nperson to call for more help. He was accordingly removed to his own\nchamber, where, willing to be still more certified of her inclinations,\nhe prolonged the farce, and lay groaning under the pretence of a severe\nfever.\n\nThe whole family was alarmed upon this occasion; for, as we have\nalready observed, he was an universal favourite. He was immediately\nvisited by the old Count and his lady, who expressed the utmost concern\nat his distemper, ordered him to be carefully attended, and sent for a\nphysician without loss of time. The young gentleman would scarce stir\nfrom his bedside, where he ministered unto him with all the\ndemonstrations of brotherly affection; and Miss exhorted him to keep up\nhis spirits, with many expressions of unreserved sympathy and regard.\nNevertheless, he saw nothing in her behaviour but what might be\nnaturally expected from common friendship, and a compassionate\ndisposition, and was very much mortified at his disappointment.\n\nWhether the miscarriage actually affected his constitution, or the\ndoctor happened to be mistaken in his diagnostics, we shall not pretend\nto determine; but the patient was certainly treated secundum artem, and\nall his complaints in a little time realised; for the physician, like a\ntrue graduate, had an eye to the apothecary in his prescriptions; and\nsuch was the concern and scrupulous care with which our hero was\nattended, that the orders of the faculty were performed with the utmost\npunctuality. He was blooded, vomited, purged, and blistered, in the\nusual forms (for the physicians of Hungary are generally as well\nskilled in the arts of their occupation as any other leeches under the\nsun), and swallowed a whole dispensary of bolusses, draughts, and\napozems, by which means he became fairly delirious in three days, and\nso untractable, that he could be no longer managed according to rule;\notherwise, in all likelihood, the world would never have enjoyed the\nbenefit of these adventures. In short, his constitution, though unable\nto cope with two such formidable antagonists as the doctor and the\ndisease he had conjured up, was no sooner rid of the one, than it\neasily got the better of the other; and though Ferdinand, after all,\nfound his grand aim unaccomplished, his malady was productive of a\nconsequence, which, though he had not foreseen it, he did not fail to\nconvert to his own use and advantage.\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nENGAGES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A FEMALE ASSOCIATE, IN ORDER TO PUT HIS\nTALENTS IN ACTION.\n\nWhile he displayed his qualifications in order to entrap the heart of\nhis young mistress, he had unwittingly enslaved the affections of her\nmaid. This attendant was also a favourite of the young lady, and,\nthough her senior by two or three good years at least, unquestionably\nher superior in point of personal beauty; she moreover possessed a good\nstock of cunning and discernment, and was furnished by nature with a\nvery amorous complexion. These circumstances being premised, the reader\nwill not be surprised to find her smitten by those uncommon\nqualifications which we have celebrated in young Fathom. She had in\ngood sooth long sighed in secret, under the powerful influence of his\ncharms, and practised upon him all those little arts, by which a woman\nstrives to attract the admiration, and ensnare the heart of a man she\nloves; but all his faculties were employed upon the plan which he had\nalready projected; that was the goal of his whole attention, to which\nall his measures tended; and whether or not he perceived the impression\nhe had made upon Teresa, he never gave her the least reason to believe\nhe was conscious of his victory, until he found himself baffled in his\ndesign upon the heart of her mistress.—She therefore persevered in her\ndistant attempts to allure him, with the usual coquetries of dress and\naddress, and, in the sweet hope of profiting by his susceptibility,\nmade shift to suppress her feelings, and keep her passion within\nbounds, until his supposed danger alarmed her fears, and raised such a\ntumult within her breast, that she could no longer conceal her love,\nbut gave a loose to her sorrow in the most immoderate expressions of\nanguish and affliction, and, while his delirium lasted, behaved with\nall the agitation of a despairing shepherdess.\n\nFerdinand was, or pretended to be, the last person in the family who\nunderstood the situation of her thoughts; when he perceived her\npassion, he entered into deliberation with himself, and tasked his\nreflection and foresight, in order to discover how best he might\nconvert this conquest to his own advantage. Here, then, that we may\nneglect no opportunity of doing justice to our hero, it will be proper\nto observe, that, howsoever unapt his understanding might be to receive\nand retain the usual culture of the schools, he was naturally a genius\nself-taught, in point of sagacity and invention.—He dived into the\ncharacters of mankind, with a penetration peculiar to himself, and, had\nhe been admitted as a pupil in any political academy, would have\ncertainly become one of the ablest statesmen in Europe.\n\nHaving revolved all the probable consequences of such a connexion, he\ndetermined to prosecute an amour with the lady whose affection he had\nsubdued; because he hoped to interest her as an auxiliary in his grand\nscheme upon Mademoiselle, which he did not as yet think proper to lay\naside; for he was not more ambitious in the plan, than indefatigable in\nthe prosecution of it. He knew it would be impossible to execute his\naims upon the Count’s daughter under the eye of Teresa, whose natural\ndiscernment would be whetted with jealousy, and who would watch his\nconduct, and thwart his progress with all the vigilance and spite of a\nslighted maiden. On the other hand, he did not doubt of being able to\nbring her over to his interest, by the influence he had already gained,\nor might afterwards acquire over her passions; in which case, she would\neffectually espouse his cause, and employ her good offices with her\nmistress in his behalf; besides, he was induced by another motive,\nwhich, though secondary, did not fail in this case to have an effect\nupon his determination. He looked upon Teresa with the eyes of\nappetite, which he longed to gratify; for he was not at all dead to the\ninstigations of the flesh, though he had philosophy enough to resist\nthem, when he thought they interfered with his interest. Here the case\nwas quite different. His desire happened to be upon the side of his\nadvantage, and therefore, resolving to indulge it, he no sooner found\nhimself in a condition to manage such an adventure, than he began to\nmake gradual advances in point of warmth and particular complacency to\nthe love-sick maid.\n\nHe first of all thanked her, in the most grateful terms, for the\nconcern she had manifested at his distemper, and the kind services he\nhad received from her during the course of it; he treated her upon all\noccasions with unusual affability and regard, assiduously courted her\nacquaintance and conversation, and contracted an intimacy that in a\nlittle time produced a declaration of love. Although her heart was too\nmuch intendered to hold out against all the forms of assault, far from\nyielding at discretion, she stood upon honourable terms, with great\nobstinacy of punctilio, and, while she owned he was master of her\ninclinations, gave him to understand, with a peremptory and resolute\nair, that he should never make a conquest of her virtue; observing,\nthat, if the passion he professed was genuine, he would not scruple to\ngive such a proof of it as would at once convince her of his sincerity;\nand that he could have no just cause to refuse her that satisfaction,\nshe being his equal in point of birth and situation; for, if he was the\ncompanion and favourite of the young Count, she was the friend and\nconfidant of Mademoiselle.\n\nHe acknowledged the strength of her argument, and that her\ncondescension was greater than his deserts, but objected against the\nproposal, as infinitely prejudicial to the fortunes of them both. He\nrepresented the state of dependence in which they mutually stood; their\nutter incapacity to support one another under the consequences of a\nprecipitate match, clandestinely made, without the consent and\nconcurrence of their patrons. He displayed, with great eloquence, all\nthose gay expectations they had reason to entertain, from that eminent\ndegree of favour which they had already secured in the family; and set\nforth, in the most alluring colours, those enchanting scenes of\npleasure they might enjoy in each other, without that disagreeable\nconsciousness of a nuptial chain, provided she would be his associate\nin the execution of a plan which he had projected for their reciprocal\nconvenience.\n\nHaving thus inflamed her love of pleasure and curiosity, he, with great\ncaution, hinted his design upon the young lady’s fortune, and,\nperceiving her listening with the most greedy attention, and perfectly\nripe for the conspiracy, he disclosed his intention at full length,\nassuring her, with the most solemn protestations of love and\nattachment, that, could he once make himself legal possessor of an\nestate which Mademoiselle inherited by the will of a deceased aunt, his\ndear Teresa should reap the happy fruits of his affluence, and wholly\nengross his time and attention.\n\nSuch a base declaration our hero would not have ventured to make, had\nhe not implicitly believed the damsel was as great a latitudinarian as\nhimself, in point of morals and principle; and been well assured, that,\nthough he should be mistaken in her way of thinking, so far as to be\nthreatened with a detection of his purpose, he would always have it in\nhis power to refute her accusation as mere calumny, by the character he\nhad hitherto maintained, and the circumspection of his future conduct.\n\nHe seldom or never erred in his observations on the human heart.\nTeresa, instead of disapproving, relished the plan in general, with\ndemonstrations of singular satisfaction. She at once conceived all the\nadvantageous consequences of such a scheme, and perceived in it only\none flaw, which, however, she did not think incurable. This defect was\nno other than a sufficient bond of union, by which they might be\neffectually tied down to their mutual interest. She foresaw, that, in\ncase Ferdinand should obtain possession of the prize, he might, with\ngreat ease, deny their contract, and disavow her claim of\nparticipation. She therefore demanded security, and proposed, as a\npreliminary of the agreement, that he should privately take her to\nwife, with a view to dispel all her apprehensions of his inconstancy or\ndeceit, as such a previous engagement would be a check upon his\nbehaviour, and keep him strictly to the letter of their contract.\n\nHe could not help subscribing to the righteousness of this proposal,\nwhich, nevertheless, he would have willingly waived, on the supposition\nthat they could not possibly be joined in the bands of wedlock with\nsuch secrecy as the nature of the case absolutely required. This would\nhave been a difficulty soon removed, had the scene of the transaction\nbeen laid in the metropolis of England, where passengers are plied in\nthe streets by clergymen, who prostitute their characters and\nconsciences for hire, in defiance of all decency and law; but in the\nkingdom of Hungary, ecclesiastics are more scrupulous in the exercise\nof their function, and the objection was, or supposed to be, altogether\ninsurmountable; so that they were fain to have recourse to an\nexpedient, with which, after some hesitation, our she-adventurer was\nsatisfied. They joined hands in the sight of Heaven, which they called\nto witness, and to judge the sincerity of their vows, and engaged, in a\nvoluntary oath, to confirm their union by the sanction of the church,\nwhenever a convenient opportunity for so doing should occur.\n\nThe scruples of Teresa being thus removed, she admitted Ferdinand to\nthe privileges of a husband, which he enjoyed in stolen interviews, and\nreadily undertook to exert her whole power in promoting his suit with\nher young mistress, because she now considered his interest as\ninseparably connected with her own. Surely nothing could be more absurd\nor preposterous than the articles of this covenant, which she insisted\nupon with such inflexibility. How could she suppose that her pretended\nlover would be restrained by an oath, when the very occasion of\nincurring it was an intention to act in violation of all laws human and\ndivine? and yet such ridiculous conjuration is commonly the cement of\nevery conspiracy, how dark, how treacherous, how impious soever it may\nbe: a certain sign that there are some remains of religion left in the\nhuman mind, even after every moral sentiment hath abandoned it; and\nthat the most execrable ruffian finds means to quiet the suggestions of\nhis conscience, by some reversionary hope of Heaven’s forgiveness.\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nTHEIR FIRST ATTEMPT; WITH A DIGRESSION WHICH SOME READERS MAY THINK\nIMPERTINENT.\n\nBe this as it will, our lovers, though real voluptuaries, amidst the\nfirst transports of their enjoyment did not neglect the great political\naim of their conjunction. Teresa’s bedchamber, to which our hero\nconstantly repaired at midnight, was the scene of their deliberations,\nand there it was determined that the damsel, in order to avoid\nsuspicion, should feign herself irritated at the indifference of\nFerdinand, her passion for whom was by this time no secret in the\nfamily; and that, with a view to countenance this affectation, he\nshould upon all occasions treat her with an air of loftiness and\ndisdain.\n\nSo screened from all imputation of fraud, she was furnished by him with\nartful instructions how to sound the inclinations of her young\nmistress, how to recommend his person and qualifications by the sure\nmethods of contradiction, comparisons, revilings, and reproach; how to\nwatch the paroxysms of her disposition, inflame her passions, and\nimprove, for his advantage, those moments of frailty from which no\nwoman is exempted. In short, this consummate politician taught his\nagent to poison the young lady’s mind with insidious conversation,\ntending to inspire her with the love of guilty pleasure, to debauch her\nsentiments, and confound her ideas of dignity and virtue. After all,\nthe task is not difficult to lead the unpractised heart astray, by dint\nof those opportunities her seducer possessed. The seeds of insinuation\nseasonably sown upon the warm luxuriant soil of youth, could hardly\nfail of shooting up into such intemperate desires as he wanted to\nproduce, especially when cultured and cherished in her unguarded hours,\nby that stimulating discourse which familiarity admits, and the looser\npassions, ingrafted in every breast, are apt to relish and excuse.\n\nFathom had previously reconnoitred the ground, and discovered some\nmarks of inflammability in Mademoiselle’s constitution; her beauty was\nnot such as to engage her in those gaieties of amusement which could\nflatter her vanity and dissipate her ideas; and she was of an age when\nthe little loves and young desires take possession of the fancy; he\ntherefore concluded, that she had the more leisure to indulge these\nenticing images of pleasure that youth never fails to create,\nparticularly in those who, like her, were addicted to solitude and\nstudy.\n\nTeresa, full fraught with the wily injunctions of her confederate, took\nthe field, and opened the campaign with such remarkable sourness in her\naspect when Ferdinand appeared, that her young lady could not help\ntaking notice of her affected chagrin, and asked the reason of such\napparent alteration in her way of thinking. Prepared for this question,\nthe other replied, in a manner calculated for giving Mademoiselle to\nunderstand, that, whatever impressions Ferdinand might have formerly\nmade on her heart, they were now altogether effaced by the pride and\ninsolence with which he had received her advances; and that her breast\nnow glowed with all the revenge of a slighted lover.\n\nTo evince the sincerity of this declaration, she bitterly inveighed\nagainst him, and even affected to depreciate those talents, in which\nshe knew his chief merit to consist; hoping, by these means, to\ninterest Mademoiselle’s candour in his defence. So far the train\nsucceeded. That young lady’s love for truth was offended at the\ncalumnies that were vented against Ferdinand in his absence. She chid\nher woman for the rancour of her remarks, and undertook to refute the\narticles of his dispraise. Teresa supported her own assertions with\ngreat obstinacy, and a dispute ensued, in which her mistress was heated\ninto some extravagant commendations of our adventurer.\n\nHis supposed enemy did not fail to make a report of her success, and to\nmagnify every advantage they had gained; believing, in good earnest,\nthat her lady’s warmth was the effect of a real passion for the\nfortunate Mr. Fathom. But he himself viewed the adventure in a\ndifferent light, and rightly imputed the violence of Mademoiselle’s\nbehaviour to the contradiction she had sustained from her maid, or to\nthe fire of her natural generosity glowing in behalf of innocence\ntraduced. Nevertheless, he was perfectly well pleased with the nature\nof the contest; because, in the course of such debates, he foresaw that\nhe should become habitually her hero, and that, in time, she would\nactually believe those exaggerations of his merit, which she herself\nhad feigned, for the honour of her own arguments.\n\nThis presage, founded upon that principle of self-respect, without\nwhich no individual exists, may certainly be justified by manifold\noccurrences in life. We ourselves have known a very pregnant example,\nwhich we shall relate, for the emolument of the reader. A certain needy\nauthor having found means to present a manuscript to one of those sons\nof fortune who are dignified with the appellation of patrons, instead\nof reaping that applause and advantage with which he had regaled his\nfancy, had the mortification to find his performance treated with\ninfinite irreverence and contempt, and, in high dudgeon and\ndisappointment, appealed to the judgment of another critic, who, he\nknew, had no veneration for the first.\n\nThis common consolation, to which all baffled authors have recourse,\nwas productive of very happy consequences to our bard; for, though the\nopinions of both judges concerning the piece were altogether the same,\nthe latter, either out of compassion to the appellant, or desire of\nrendering his rival ridiculous in the eye of taste, undertook to repair\nthe misfortune, and in this manner executed the plan. In a meeting of\nliterati, to which both these wits belonged, he who had espoused the\npoet’s cause, having previously desired another member to bring his\ncomposition on the carpet, no sooner heard it mentioned, than he began\nto censure it with flagrant marks of scorn, and, with an ironical air,\nlooking at its first condemner, observed, that he must be furiously\ninfected with the rage of patronising, who could take such a deplorable\nperformance into his protection. The sarcasm took effect.\n\nThe person against whom it was levelled, taking umbrage at his\npresumption, assumed an aspect of disdain, and replied with great\nanimosity, that nothing was more easily supported than the character of\na Zoilus, because no production was altogether free from blemishes; and\nany man might pronounce against any piece by the lump, without\ninteresting his own discernment; but to perceive the beauties of a\nwork, it was requisite to have learning, judgment, and taste; and\ntherefore he did not wonder that the gentleman had overlooked a great\nmany in the composition which he so contemptuously decried. A rejoinder\nsucceeded this reply, and produced a long train of altercation, in\nwhich the gentleman, who had formerly treated the book with such\ndisrespect, now professed himself its passionate admirer, and held\nforth in praise of it with great warmth and elocution.\n\nNot contented with having exhibited this instance of regard, he next\nmorning sent a message to the owner, importing, that he had but\nsuperficially glanced over the manuscript, and desiring the favour of\nperusing it a second time. Being indulged in this request, he\nrecommended it in terms of rapture to all his friends and dependants,\nand, by dint of unwearied solicitation, procured a very ample\nsubscription for the author.\n\nBut, to resume the thread of our story. Teresa’s practices were not\nconfined to simple defamation. Her reproaches were contrived so as to\nimply some intelligence in favour of the person she reviled. In\nexemplifying his pertness and arrogance, she repeated his witty\nrepartee; on pretence of blaming his ferocity, she recounted proofs of\nhis spirit and prowess; and, in explaining the source of his vanity,\ngave her mistress to understand, that a certain young lady of fashion\nwas said to be enamoured of his person. Nor did this well-instructed\nunderstrapper omit those other parts of her cue which the principal\njudged necessary for the furtherance of his scheme. Her conversation\nbecame less guarded, and took a freer turn than usual; she seized all\nopportunities of introducing little amorous stories, the greatest part\nof which were invented for the purposes of warming her passions, and\nlowering the price of chastity in her esteem; for she represented all\nthe young lady’s contemporaries in point of age and situation, as so\nmany sensualists, who, without scruple, indulged themselves in the\nstolen pleasures of youth.\n\nMeanwhile, Ferdinand seconded these endeavours with his whole industry\nand address. He redoubled, if possible, his deference and respect,\nwhetting his assiduity to the keenest edge of attention; and, in short,\nregulated his dress, conversation, and deportment, according to the\nfancy, turn, and prevailing humour of his young mistress. He, moreover,\nattempted to profit by her curiosity, which he knew to be truly\nfeminine; and having culled from the library of his patron certain\ndangerous books, calculated to debauch the minds of young people, left\nthem occasionally upon the table in his apartment, after having\ndirected Teresa to pick them up, as if by accident, in his absence, and\ncarry them off for the entertainment of Mademoiselle; nay, this crafty\nprojector found means to furnish his associate with some mischievous\npreparations, which were mingled in her chocolate, tea, or coffee, as\nprovocations to warm her constitution; yet all these machinations,\ningenious as they were, failed, not only in fulfilling their aim, but\neven in shaking the foundations of her virtue or pride, which stood\ntheir assaults unmoved, like a strong tower built upon a rock,\nimpregnable to all the tempestuous blasts of heaven.\n\nNot but that the conspirators were more than once mistaken in the\neffects of their artifices, and disposed to applaud themselves on the\nprogress they had made. When at any time she expressed a desire to\nexamine those performances which were laid before her as snares to\nentrap her chastity, they attributed that, which was no other than\ncuriosity, to a looseness of sentiment; and when she discovered no\naversion to hear those anecdotes concerning the frailty of her\nneighbours, they imputed to abatement of chastity that satisfaction\nwhich was the result of self-congratulation on her own superior virtue.\n\nSo far did the treacherous accomplice of Fathom presume upon these\nmisconstructions, that she at length divested her tongue of all\nrestraint, and behaved in such a manner, that the young lady,\nconfounded and incensed at her indecency and impudence, rebuked her\nwith great severity, and commanded her to reform her discourse, on pain\nof being dismissed with disgrace from her service.\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\nTHE CONFEDERATES CHANGE THEIR BATTERY, AND ACHIEVE A REMARKABLE\nADVENTURE.\n\nThunderstruck at this disappointment, the confederates held a council,\nin order to deliberate upon the next measures that should be taken; and\nFerdinand, for the present, despairing of accomplishing his grand aim,\nresolved to profit in another manner, by the conveniency of his\nsituation. He represented to his helpmate, that it would be prudent for\nthem to make hay while the sun shone, as their connexion might be\nsooner or later discovered, and an end put to all those opportunities\nwhich they now so happily enjoyed. All principles of morality had been\nalready excluded from their former plan; consequently he found it an\neasy task to interest Teresa in any other scheme tending to their\nmutual advantage, howsoever wicked and perfidious it might be. He\ntherefore persuaded her to be his auxiliary in defrauding Mademoiselle\nat play, and gave her suitable directions for that purpose; and even\ntutored her how to abuse the trust reposed in her, by embezzling the\nyoung lady’s effects, without incurring the suspicion of dishonesty.\n\nOn the supposition that every servant in the house was not able to\nresist such temptation, the purse of her mistress, to which the maid\nhad always access, was dropped in a passage which the domestics had\noccasion to frequent; and Fathom posted himself in a convenient place,\nin order to observe the effect of his stratagem. Here he was not\ndisappointed in his conjecture. The first person who chanced to pass\nthat way, was one of the chambermaids, with whom Teresa had lived for\nsome time in a state of inveterate enmity, because the wench had failed\nin that homage and respect which was paid to her by the rest of the\nservants.\n\nFerdinand had, in his heart, espoused the quarrel of his associate, and\nlonged for an occasion to deliver her from the malicious observance of\nsuch an antagonist. When he, therefore, saw her approach, his heart\nthrobbed with joyful expectations; but, when she snatched up the purse,\nand thrust it in her bosom, with all the eagerness and confusion of one\ndetermined to appropriate the windfall to her own use, his transports\nwere altogether unspeakable. He traced her to her own apartment,\nwhither she immediately retreated with great trepidation, and then\ncommunicated the discovery to Teresa, together with instructions how to\nbehave in the sequel.\n\nIn conformity with these lessons, she took the first opportunity of\ngoing to Mademoiselle, and demanding money for some necessary expense,\nthat the loss might be known before the finder could have leisure to\nmake any fresh conveyance of the prize; and, in the meantime, Ferdinand\nkept a strict eye upon the motions of the chambermaid. The young lady,\nhaving rummaged her pockets in vain, expressed some surprise at the\nloss of her purse; upon which her attendant gave indications of extreme\namazement and concern. She said, it could not possibly be lost;\nentreated her to search her escritoir, while she herself ran about the\nroom, prying into every corner, with all the symptoms of fear and\ndistraction. Having made this unsuccessful inquiry, she pretended to\nshed a flood of tears, bewailing her own fate, in being near the person\nof any lady who met with such a misfortune, by which, she observed, her\ncharacter might be called in question. She produced her own keys, and\nbegged upon her knees, that her chamber and boxes might be searched\nwithout delay.\n\nIn a word, she demeaned herself so artfully upon this occasion, that\nher mistress, who never entertained the least doubt of her integrity,\nnow looked upon her as a miracle of fidelity and attachment, and was at\ninfinite pains to console her for the accident which had happened;\nprotesting that, for her own part, the loss of the money should never\naffect her with a moment’s uneasiness, if she could retrieve a certain\nmedal which she had long kept in her purse, as a remembrance of her\ndeceased aunt, from whom she received it in a present.\n\nFathom entered accidentally into the midst of this well-acted scene,\nand, perceiving the agitation of the maid, and the concern of the\nmistress, desired, in a respectful manner, to know the cause of their\ndisorder. Before the young lady had time to make him acquainted with\nthe circumstances of the case, his accomplice exclaimed, in an affected\npassion, “Mr. Fathom, my lady has lost her purse; and, as no persons in\nthe family are so much about her as you and I, you must give me leave,\nin my own justification, to insist upon Mademoiselle’s ordering the\napartments of us both to be searched without loss of time. Here are my\npockets and my keys, and you cannot scruple to give her the same\nsatisfaction; for innocence has nothing to fear.”\n\nMiss Melvil reprimanded her sharply for her unmannerly zeal; and\nFerdinand eyeing her with a look of disdain, “Madam,” said he, “I\napprove of your proposal; but, before I undergo such mortification, I\nwould advise Mademoiselle to subject the two chambermaids to such\ninquiry; as they also have access to the apartments, and are, I\napprehend, as likely as you or I to behave in such a scandalous\nmanner.”\n\nThe young lady declared that she was too well satisfied of Teresa’s\nhonesty and Ferdinand’s honour, to harbour the least suspicion of\neither, and that she would sooner die than disgrace them so far as to\ncomply with the proposal the former had made; but as she saw no reason\nfor exempting the inferior servants from that examination which Fathom\nadvised, she would forthwith put it in execution. The chambermaids\nbeing accordingly summoned, she calmly asked if either of them had\naccidentally found the purse she had dropped? and both replying in the\nnegative, she assumed an air of severity and determination, and\ndemanding their keys, threatened to examine their trunks on the\ninstant.\n\nThe guilty Abigail, who, though an Hungarian, was not inferior, in\npoint of effrontery, to any one of the sisterhood in England, no sooner\nheard this menace, than she affected an air of affronted innocence,\nthanked God she had lived in many reputable families, and been trusted\nwith untold gold, but was never before suspected of theft; that the\nother maid might do as she should think proper, and be mean-spirited\nenough to let her things be tumbled topsy-turvy and exposed; but, for\nher own part, if she should be used in that inhuman and disgraceful\nmanner, she would not stay another hour in the house; and in conclusion\nsaid, that Mademoiselle had more reason to look sharp after those who\nenjoyed the greatest share of her favour, than believe their malicious\ninsinuations against innocent people whom they were well known to hate\nand defame.\n\nThis declaration, implying an hint to the prejudice of Teresa, far from\ndiverting Miss Melvil from her purpose, served only to enhance the\ncharacter of the accused in her opinion, and to confirm her suspicion\nof the accuser, of whom she again demanded her keys, protesting that,\nshould she prove refractory, the Count himself should take cognisance\nof the affair, whereas, if she would deal ingenuously, she should have\nno cause to repent of her confession. So saying, she desired our\nadventurer to take the trouble of calling up some of the men-servants;\nupon which the conscious criminal began to tremble, and, falling upon\nher knees, acknowledged her guilt, and implored the forgiveness of her\nyoung mistress.\n\nTeresa, seizing this occasion to signalise her generosity, joined in\nthe request, and the offender was pardoned, after having restored the\npurse, and promised in the sight of Heaven, that the devil should never\nagain entice her to the commission of such a crime. This adventure\nfully answered all the purposes of our politician; it established the\nopinion of his fellow-labourer’s virtue, beyond the power of accident\nor information to shake, and set up a false beacon to mislead the\nsentiments of Mademoiselle, in case she should for the future meet with\nthe like misfortune.\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nTHEY PROCEED TO LEVY CONTRIBUTIONS WITH GREAT SUCCESS, UNTIL OUR HERO\nSETS OUT WITH THE YOUNG COUNT FOR VIENNA, WHERE HE ENTERS INTO LEAGUE\nWITH ANOTHER ADVENTURER.\n\nUnder this secure cover, Teresa levied contributions upon her mistress\nwith great success. Some trinket was missing every day; the young\nlady’s patience began to fail; the faithful attendant was overwhelmed\nwith consternation, and, with the appearance of extreme chagrin,\ndemanded her dismission, affirming that these things were certainly\neffected by some person in the family, with a view of murdering her\nprecious reputation. Miss Melvil, not without difficulty, quieted her\nvexation with assurances of inviolable confidence and esteem, until a\npair of diamond earrings vanished, when Teresa could no longer keep her\naffliction within bounds. Indeed, this was an event of more consequence\nthan all the rest which had happened, for the jewels were valued at\nfive hundred florins.\n\nMademoiselle was accordingly alarmed to such a degree, that she made\nher mother acquainted with her loss, and that good lady, who was an\nexcellent economist, did not fail to give indications of extraordinary\nconcern. She asked, if her daughter had reason to suspect any\nindividual in the family, and if she was perfectly confident of her own\nwoman’s integrity? Upon which Mademoiselle, with many encomiums on the\nfidelity and attachment of Teresa, recounted the adventure of the\nchambermaid, who immediately underwent a strict inquiry, and was even\ncommitted to prison, on the strength of her former misdemeanour. Our\nadventurer’s mate insisted upon undergoing the same trial with the rest\nof the domestics, and, as usual, comprehended Fathom in her\ninsinuations; while he seconded the proposal, and privately counselled\nthe old lady to introduce Teresa to the magistrate of the place. By\nthese preconcerted recriminations, they escaped all suspicion of\ncollusion. After a fruitless inquiry, the prisoner was discharged from\nher confinement, and turned out of the service of the Count, in whose\nprivate opinion the character of no person suffered so much, as that of\nhis own son, whom he suspected of having embezzled the jewels, for the\nuse of a certain inamorata, who, at that time, was said to have\ncaptivated his affections.\n\nThe old gentleman felt upon this occasion all that internal anguish\nwhich a man of honour may be supposed to suffer, on account of a son’s\ndegeneracy; and, without divulging his sentiments, or even hinting his\nsuspicions to the youth himself, determined to detach him at once from\nsuch dangerous connexions, by sending him forthwith to Vienna, on\npretence of finishing his exercises at the academy, and ushering him\ninto acquaintance with the great world. Though he would not be thought\nby the young gentleman himself to harbour the least doubt of his\nmorals, he did not scruple to unbosom himself on that subject to\nFerdinand, whose sagacity and virtue he held in great veneration. This\nindulgent patron expressed himself in the most pathetic terms, on the\nuntoward disposition of his son; he told Fathom, that he should\naccompany Renaldo (that was the youth’s name) not only as a companion,\nbut a preceptor and pattern; conjured him to assist his tutor in\nsuperintending his conduct, and to reinforce the governor’s precepts by\nhis own example; to inculcate upon him the most delicate punctilios of\nhonour, and decoy him into extravagance, rather than leave the least\nilliberal sentiment in his heart.\n\nOur crafty adventurer, with demonstrations of the utmost sensibility,\nacknowledged the great goodness of the Count in reposing such\nconfidence in his integrity; which, as he observed, none but the worst\nof villains could abuse; and fervently wished that he might no longer\nexist, than he should continue to remember and resent the obligations\nhe owed to his kind benefactor. While preparations were making for\ntheir departure, our hero held a council with his associate, whom he\nenriched with many sage instructions touching her future operations; he\nat the same time disburdened her of all or the greatest part of the\nspoils she had won, and after having received divers marks of bounty\nfrom the Count and his lady, together with a purse from his young\nmistress, he set out for Vienna, in the eighteenth year of his age,\nwith Renaldo and his governor, who were provided with letters of\nrecommendation to some of the Count’s friends belonging to the Imperial\ncourt.\n\nSuch a favourable introduction could not fail of being advantageous to\na youth of Ferdinand’s specious accomplishments; for he was considered\nas the young Count’s companion, admitted into his parties, and included\nin all the entertainments to which Renaldo was invited. He soon\ndistinguished himself by his activity and address, in the course of\nthose exercises that were taught at the academy of which he was pupil;\nhis manners were so engaging as to attract the acquaintance of his\nfellow-students, and his conversation being sprightly and inoffensive,\ngrew into very great request; in a word, he and the young Count formed\na remarkable contrast, which, in the eye of the world, redounded to his\nadvantage.\n\nThey were certainly, in all respects, the reverse of each other.\nRenaldo, under a total defect of exterior cultivation, possessed a most\nexcellent understanding, with every virtue that dignifies the human\nheart; while the other, beneath a most agreeable outside, with an\ninaptitude and aversion to letters, concealed an amazing fund of\nvillany and ingratitude. Hitherto his observation had been confined to\na narrow sphere, and his reflections, though surprisingly just and\nacute, had not attained to that maturity which age and experience give;\nbut now, his perceptions began to be more distinct, and extended to a\nthousand objects which had never before come under his cognisance.\n\nHe had formerly imagined, but was now fully persuaded, that the sons of\nmen preyed upon one another, and such was the end and condition of\ntheir being. Among the principal figures of life, he observed few or no\ncharacters that did not bear a strong analogy to the savage tyrants of\nthe wood. One resembled a tiger in fury and rapaciousness; a second\nprowled about like an hungry wolf, seeking whom he might devour; a\nthird acted the part of a jackal, in beating the bush for game to his\nvoracious employer; and the fourth imitated the wily fox, in practising\na thousand crafty ambuscades for the destruction of the ignorant and\nunwary. This last was the department of life for which he found himself\nbest qualified by nature and inclination; and he accordingly resolved\nthat his talent should not rust in his possession. He was already\npretty well versed in all the sciences of play; but he had every day\noccasion to see these arts carried to such a surprising pitch of\nfinesse and dexterity, as discouraged him from building his schemes on\nthat foundation.\n\nHe therefore determined to fascinate the judgment, rather than the eyes\nof his fellow-creatures, by a continual exercise of that gift of\ndeceiving, with which he knew himself endued to an unrivalled degree;\nand to acquire unbounded influence with those who might be subservient\nto his interest, by an assiduous application to their prevailing\npassions. Not that play was altogether left out in the projection of\nhis economy.— Though he engaged himself very little in the executive\npart of gaming, he had not been long in Vienna, when he entered into\nleague with a genius of that kind, whom he distinguished among the\npupils of the academy, and who indeed had taken up his habitation in\nthat place with a view to pillage the provincials on their first\narrival in town, before they could be armed with proper circumspection\nto preserve their money, or have time to dispose of it in any other\nshape.\n\nSimilar characters naturally attract each other, and people of our\nhero’s principles are, of all others, the most apt to distinguish their\nown likeness wheresoever it occurs; because they always keep the\nfaculty of discerning in full exertion. It was in consequence of this\nmutual alertness, that Ferdinand and the stranger, who was a native of\nTyrol, perceived themselves reflected in the dispositions of each\nother, and immediately entered into an offensive and defensive\nalliance; our adventurer undertaking for the articles of intelligence,\ncountenance, and counsel, and his associate charging himself with the\nrisk of execution.\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\nFATHOM MAKES VARIOUS EFFORTS IN THE WORLD OF GALLANTRY.\n\nThus connected, they began to hunt in couples; and Fathom, in order to\nprofit by the alliance with a good grace, contrived a small scheme that\nsucceeded to his wish. Renaldo being one night intoxicated in the\ncourse of a merry-making with his fellow-pupils, from which Fathom had\npurposely absented himself, was by the Tyrolese so artfully provoked to\nplay, that he could not resist the temptation, but engaged at passdice\nwith that fell adversary, who, in less than an hour, stripped him of a\npretty round sum. Next day, when the young gentleman recovered the use\nof his reflection, he was sensibly chagrined at the folly and\nprecipitation of his own conduct, an account of which he communicated\nin confidence to our hero, with demonstrations of infinite shame and\nconcern.\n\nFerdinand, having moralised upon the subject with great sagacity, and\nsharply inveighed against the Tyrolese, for the unfair advantage he had\ntaken, retired to his closet, and wrote the following billet, which was\nimmediately sent to his ally:—\n\n“The obligations I owe, and the attachments I feel, to the Count de\nMelvil, will not suffer me to be an idle spectator of the wrongs\noffered to his son, in the dishonourable use, I understand, you made\nlast night of his unguarded hours. I therefore insist upon your making\nimmediate restitution of the booty which you so unjustly got; otherwise\nI expect you will meet me upon the ramparts, near the bastion de la\nPort Neuve, to-morrow morning at daybreak, in order to justify, with\nyour sword, the finesse you have practised upon the friend of FERDINAND\nDE FATHOM.”\n\nThe gamester no sooner received this intimation, than, according to the\nplan which had been preconcerted betwixt the author and him, he went to\nthe apartment of Renaldo, and presenting the sum of money which he had\ndefrauded him of the preceding night, told him, with a stern\ncountenance, that, though it was a just acquisition, he scorned to\navail himself of his good fortune against any person who entertained\nthe smallest doubt of his honour.\n\nThe young Count, surprised at this address, rejected his offer with\ndisdain, and desired to know the meaning of such an unexpected\ndeclaration. Upon which, the other produced Ferdinand’s billet, and\nthreatened, in very high terms, to meet the stripling according to his\ninvitation, and chastise him severely for his presumption. The\nconsequence of this explanation is obvious. Renaldo, imputing the\nofficiousness of Fathom to the zeal of his friendship, interposed in\nthe quarrel, which was amicably compromised, not a little to the honour\nof our adventurer, who thus obtained an opportunity of displaying his\ncourage and integrity, without the least hazard to his person; while,\nat the same time, his confederate recommended himself to the esteem of\nthe young Count, by his spirited behaviour on this occasion; so that\nRenaldo being less shy of his company for the future, the Tyrolese had\nthe fairer opportunities to prosecute his designs upon the young\ngentleman’s purse.\n\nIt would be almost superfluous to say, that these were not neglected.\nThe son of Count Melvil was not deficient in point of penetration; but\nhis whole study was at that time engrossed by the care of his\neducation, and he had sometimes recourse to play as an amusement by\nwhich he sought to unbend the severity of his attention. No wonder then\nthat he fell a prey to an artful gamester, who had been regularly\ntrained to the profession, and made it the sole study of his life;\nespecially as the Hungarian was remarkable for a warmth of temper,\nwhich a knight of the post always knows how to manage for his own\nadvantage.\n\nIn the course of these operations, Fathom was a very useful\ncorrespondent. He instructed the Tyrolese in the peculiarities of\nRenaldo’s disposition, and made him acquainted with the proper seasons\nfor profiting by his dexterity. Ferdinand, for example, who, by the\nauthority derived to him from the injunctions of the old Count,\nsometimes took upon himself the office of an adviser, cunningly chose\nto counsel the son at those conjunctures when he knew him least able to\nbear such expostulation. Advice improperly administered generally acts\nin diametrical opposition to the purpose for which it is supposed to be\ngiven; at least this was the case with the young gentleman, who,\ninflamed by the reproof of such a tutor, used to obey the dictates of\nhis resentment in an immediate repetition of that conduct which our\nadventurer had taken the liberty to disapprove; and the gamester was\nalways at hand to minister unto his indignation. By these means he was\ndisencumbered of divers considerable remittances, with which his father\ncheerfully supplied him, on the supposition that they were spent with\ntaste and liberality, under the direction of our adventurer.\n\nBut Ferdinand’s views were not confined to the narrow field of this\nalliance. He attempted divers enterprises in the world of gallantry,\nconscious of his own personal qualifications, and never doubting that\nhe could insinuate himself into the good graces of some married lady\nabout court, or lay an opulent dowager under contribution. But he met\nwith an obstacle in his endeavours of this kind, which all his art was\nunable to surmount. This was no other than the obscurity of his birth,\nand the want of a title, without which no person in that country lays\nclaim to the privileges of a gentleman. Had he foreseen this\ninconvenience he might have made shift to obviate the consequences, by\nobtaining permission to appear in the character of the Count’s kinsman;\nthough, in all probability, such an expedient would not have been\nextremely agreeable to the old gentleman, who was very tenacious of the\nhonour of his family; nevertheless, his generosity might have been\nprevailed upon to indulge Fathom with such a pretext, in consideration\nof the youth’s supposed attachment, and the obligations for which he\ndeemed himself indebted to his deceased mother.\n\nTrue it is, Ferdinand, upon his first arrival at Vienna, had been\nadmitted into fashionable company, on the footing of Renaldo’s\ncompanion, because nobody suspected the defect of his pedigree; and\neven after a report had been circulated to the prejudice of his\nextraction, by the industry of a lacquey who attended the young Count,\nthere were not wanting many young people of distinction who still\nfavoured him with their countenance and correspondence; but he was no\nlonger invited to private families, in which only he could expect to\nprofit by his address among the ladies, and had the mortification of\nfinding himself frequently excepted from parties which were expressly\ncalculated for the entertainment of the young Count. Luckily, his\nspirit was so pliant as to sustain these slights without being much\ndejected; instead of repining at the loss of that respect which had\nbeen paid to him at first, he endeavoured, with all his might, to\npreserve the little that still remained, and resolved to translate into\na humbler sphere that gallantry which he had no longer opportunities of\ndisplaying in the world of rank and fashion.\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\nHE EFFECTS A LODGMENT IN THE HOUSE OF A RICH JEWELLER.\n\nIn consequence of this determination, he to the uttermost exerted his\ngood-humour among the few friends of consequence his fortune had left,\nand even carried his complaisance so far as to become the humble\nservant of their pleasures, while he attempted to extend his\nacquaintance in an inferior path of life, where he thought his talents\nwould shine more conspicuous than at the assemblies of the great, and\nconduce more effectually to the interest of all his designs. Nor did he\nfind himself disappointed in that expectation, sanguine as it was. He\nsoon found means to be introduced to the house of a wealthy bourgeois,\nwhere every individual was charmed with his easy air and extraordinary\nqualifications. He accommodated himself surprisingly to the humours of\nthe whole family; smoked tobacco, swallowed wine, and discoursed of\nstones with the husband, who was a rich jeweller; sacrificed himself to\nthe pride and loquacity of the wife; and played upon the violin, and\nsung alternately, for the amusement of his only daughter, a buxom lass,\nnearly of his own age, the fruit of a former marriage.\n\nIt was not long before Ferdinand had reason to congratulate himself on\nthe footing he had gained in this society. He had expected to find, and\nin a little time actually discovered, that mutual jealousy and rancour\nwhich almost always subsist between a daughter and her step-dame,\ninflamed with all the virulence of female emulation; for the disparity\nin their ages served only to render them the more inveterate rivals in\nthe desire of captivating the other sex. Our adventurer having\ndeliberated upon the means of converting this animosity to his own\nadvantage, saw no method for this purpose so feasible as that of making\nhis approaches to the hearts of both, by ministering to each in\nprivate, food for their reciprocal envy and malevolence; because he\nwell knew that no road lies so direct and open to a woman’s heart as\nthat of gratifying her passions of vanity and resentment.\n\nWhen he had an opportunity of being particular with the mother, he\nexpressed his concern for having unwittingly incurred the displeasure\nof Mademoiselle, which, he observed, was obvious in every circumstance\nof her behaviour towards him; protesting he was utterly innocent of all\nintention of offending her; and that he could not account for his\ndisgrace any other way, than by supposing she took umbrage at the\ndirection of his chief regards towards her mother-in-law, which, he\nowned, was altogether involuntary, being wholly influenced by that\nlady’s superior charms and politeness.\n\nSuch a declaration was perfectly well calculated for the meridian of a\ndame like her, who with all the intoxications of unenlightened pride,\nand an increased appetite for pleasure, had begun to find herself\nneglected, and even to believe that her attractions were actually on\nthe wane. She very graciously consoled our gallant for the mishap of\nwhich he complained, representing Wilhelmina (that was the daughter’s\nname) as a pert, illiterate, envious baggage, of whose disgust he ought\nto make no consideration; then she recounted many instances of her own\ngenerosity to that young lady, with the returns of malice and\ningratitude she had made; and, lastly, enumerated all the imperfections\nof her person, education, and behaviour; that he might see with what\njustice the gypsy pretended to vie with those who had been\ndistinguished by the approbation and even gallantry of the best people\nin Vienna.\n\nHaving thus established himself her confidant and gossip, he knew his\nnext step of promotion would necessarily be to the degree of her lover;\nand in that belief resolved to play the same game with Mademoiselle\nWilhelmina, whose complexion was very much akin to that of her\nstepmother; indeed they resembled each other too much to live upon any\nterms of friendship or even decorum. Fathom, in order to enjoy a\nprivate conversation with the young lady, never failed to repeat his\nvisit every afternoon, till at length he had the pleasure of finding\nher disengaged, the jeweller being occupied among his workmen, and his\nwife gone to assist at a lying-in.\n\nOur adventurer and the daughter had already exchanged their vows, by\nthe expressive language of the eyes; he had even declared himself in\nsome tender ejaculations which had been softly whispered in her ear,\nwhen he could snatch an opportunity of venting them unperceived; nay,\nhe had upon divers occasions gently squeezed her fair hand, on pretence\nof tuning her harpsichord, and been favoured with returns of the same\ncordial pressure; so that, instead of accosting her with the fearful\nhesitation and reserve of a timid swain, he told her, after the\nexercise of the doux-yeux, that he was come to confer with her upon a\nsubject that nearly concerned her peace; and asked if she had not\nobserved of late an evident abatement of friendship in her mother’s\nbehaviour to him, whom she had formerly treated with such marks of\nfavour and respect. Mademoiselle would not pay so ill a compliment to\nher own discernment as to say she had not perceived the alteration;\nwhich, on the contrary, she owned was extremely palpable; nor was it\ndifficult to divine the cause of such estranged looks. This remark was\naccompanied with an irresistible glance; she smiled enchanting, the\ncolour deepened on her cheeks, her breast began to heave, and her whole\nframe underwent a most agreeable confusion.\n\nFerdinand was not a man to let such a favourable conjuncture pass\nunregarded. “Yes, charming Wilhelmina!” exclaimed the politician in an\naffected rapture, “the cause is as conspicuous as your attractions. She\nhath, in spite of all my circumspection, perceived that passion which\nit is not in my power to conceal, and in consequence of which I now\ndeclare myself your devoted adorer; or, conscious of your superior\nexcellence, her jealousy hath taken the alarm, and, though stung with\nconjecture only, repines at the triumph of your perfections. How far\nthis spirit of malignity may be inflamed to my prejudice, I know not.\nPerhaps, as this is the first, it may be also the last opportunity I\nshall have of avowing the dearest sentiments of my heart to the fair\nobject that inspired them; in a word, I may be for ever excluded from\nyour presence. Excuse me, then, divine creature! from the practice of\nthose unnecessary forms, which I should take pride in observing, were I\nindulged with the ordinary privileges of an honourable lover; and, once\nfor all, accept the homage of an heart overflowing with love and\nadmiration. Yes, adorable Wilhelmina! I am dazzled with your\nsupernatural beauty; your other accomplishments strike me with wonder\nand awe. I am enchanted by the graces of your deportment, ravished with\nthe charms of your conversation; and there is a certain tenderness of\nbenevolence in that endearing aspect, which, I trust, will not fail to\nmelt with sympathy at the emotions of a faithful slave like me.”\n\nSo saying, he threw himself upon his knees, and, seizing her plump\nhand, pressed it to his lips with all the violence of real transport.\nThe nymph, whose passions nature had filled to the brim, could not hear\nsuch a rhapsody unmoved. Being an utter stranger to addresses of this\nkind, she understood every word of it in the literal acceptation; she\nbelieved implicitly in the truth of the encomiums he had bestowed, and\nthought it reasonable he should be rewarded for the justice he had done\nto her qualifications, which had hitherto been almost altogether\noverlooked. In short, her heart began to thaw, and her face to hang out\nthe flag of capitulation; which was no sooner perceived by our hero,\nthan he renewed his attack with redoubled fervour, pronouncing in a\nmost vehement tone, “Light of my eyes, and empress of my soul! behold\nme prostrate at your feet, waiting with the most pious resignation, for\nthat sentence from your lips, on which my future happiness or misery\nmust altogether depend. Not with more reverence does the unhappy bashaw\nkiss the sultan’s letter that contains his doom, than I will submit to\nyour fatal determination. Speak then, angelic sweetness! for never, ah!\nnever will I rise from this suppliant posture, until I am encouraged to\nlive and hope. No! if you refuse to smile upon my passion, here shall I\nbreathe the last sighs of a despairing lover; here shall this faithful\nsword do the last office to its unfortunate master, and shed the blood\nof the truest heart that ever felt the cruel pangs of disappointed\nlove.”\n\nThe young lady, well-nigh overcome by this effusion, which brought the\ntears into her eyes, “Enough, enough,” cried she, interrupting him,\n“sure you men were created for the ruin of our sex.”—“Ruin!” re-echoed\nFathom, “talk not of ruin and Wilhelmina! let these terms be for ever\nparted, far as the east and west asunder! let ever smiling peace attend\nher steps, and love and joy still wanton in her train! Ruin, indeed,\nshall wait upon her enemies, if such there be, and those love-lorn\nwretches who pine with anguish under her disdain. Grant me, kind\nHeaven, a more propitious boon; direct her genial regards to one whose\nlove is without example, and whose constancy is unparalleled. Bear\nwitness to my constancy and faith, ye verdant hills, ye fertile plains,\nye shady groves, ye purling streams; and if I prove untrue, ah! let me\nnever find a solitary willow or a bubbling brook, by help of which I\nmay be enabled to put a period to my wretched life.”\n\nHere this excellent actor began to sob most piteously, and the\ntender-hearted Wilhelmina, unable longer to withstand his moving tale,\nwith a repetition of the interjection, ah! gently dropped into his\narms. This was the beginning of a correspondence that soon rose to a\nvery interesting pitch; and they forthwith concerted measures for\ncarrying it on without the knowledge or suspicion of her mother-in-law.\nNevertheless, the young lady, vanquished as she was, and unskilled in\nthe ways of men, would not all at once yield at discretion; but\ninsisted upon those terms, without which no woman’s reputation can be\nsecured. Our lover, far from seeking to evade the proposal, assented to\nit in terms of uncommon satisfaction, and promised to use his whole\nindustry in finding a priest upon whose discretion they could rely;\nnay, he certainly resolved to comply with her request in good earnest,\nrather than forfeit the advantages which he foresaw in their union. His\ngood fortune, however, exempted him from the necessity of taking such a\nstep, which at best must have been disagreeable; for so many\ndifficulties occurred in the inquiry which was set on foot, and so\nartfully did Fathom in the meantime manage the influence he had already\ngained over her heart, that, before her passion could obtain a legal\ngratification, she surrendered to his wish, without any other\nassurance, than his solemn profession of sincerity and truth, on which\nshe reposed herself with the most implicit confidence and faith.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nHE IS EXPOSED TO A MOST PERILOUS INCIDENT IN THE COURSE OF HIS INTRIGUE\nWITH THE DAUGHTER.\n\nHe was rejoiced to find her so easily satisfied in such a momentous\nconcern, for the principal aim of the intrigue was to make her\nnecessary to his interested views, and even, if possible, an associate\nin the fraudulent plans he had projected upon her father; consequently\nhe considered this relaxation in her virtue as an happy omen of his\nfuture success. All the obstacles to their mutual enjoyment being thus\nremoved, our adventurer was by his mistress indulged with an\nassignation in her own chamber, which, though contiguous to that of her\nstepmother, was provided with a door that opened into a common\nstaircase, to which he had access at all hours of the night.\n\nHe did not neglect the rendezvous, but, presenting himself at the\nappointed time, which was midnight, made the signal they had agreed\nupon, and was immediately admitted by Wilhelmina, who waited for hire\nwith a lover’s impatience. Fathom was not deficient in those\nexpressions of rapture that are current on those occasions; but, on the\ncontrary, became so loud in the transports of self-congratulation, that\nhis voice reached the ears of the vigilant stepmother, who wakening the\njeweller from his first nap, gave him to understand that some person\nwas certainly in close conversation with his daughter; and exhorted him\nto rise forthwith, and vindicate the honour of his family.\n\nThe German, who was naturally of a phlegmatic habit, and never went to\nbed without a full dose of the creature, which added to his\nconstitutional drowsiness, gave no ear to his wife’s intimation, until\nshe had repeated it thrice, and used other means to rouse him from the\narms of slumber. Meanwhile Fathom and his inamorata overheard her\ninformation, and our hero would have made his retreat immediately,\nthrough the port by which he entered, had not his intention been\noverruled by the remonstrances of the young lady, who observed that the\ndoor was already fast bolted, and could not possibly be opened without\ncreating a noise that would confirm the suspicion of her parents; and\nthat over and above this objection he would, in sallying from that\ndoor, run the risk of being met by her father, who in all probability\nwould present himself before it, in order to hinder our hero’s escape.\nShe therefore conveyed him softly into her closet, where she assured\nhim he might remain with great tranquillity, in full confidence that\nshe would take such measures as would effectually screen him from\ndetection.\n\nHe was fain to depend upon her assurance, and accordingly ensconced\nhimself behind her dressing-table; but he could not help sweating with\napprehension, and praying fervently to God for his deliverance, when he\nheard the jeweller thundering at the door, and calling to his daughter\nfor admittance. Wilhelmina, who was already undressed, and had\npurposely extinguished the light, pretended to be suddenly waked from\nher sleep, and starting up, exclaimed in a tone of surprise and\naffright, “Jesu, Maria! what is the matter?”—“Hussy!” replied the\nGerman in a terrible accent, “open the door this instant; there is a\nman in your bedchamber, and, by the lightning and thunder! I will wash\naway the stain he has cast upon my honour with the schellum’s\nheart’s-blood.”\n\nNot at all intimidated by this boisterous threat, she admitted him\nwithout hesitation, and, with a shrillness of voice peculiar to\nherself, began to hold forth upon her own innocence and his unjust\nsuspicion, mingling in her harangue sundry oblique hints against her\nmother-in-law, importing, that some people were so viciously inclined\nby their own natures, that she did not wonder at their doubting the\nvirtue of other people; but that these people despised the insinuations\nof such people, who ought to be more circumspect in their own conduct,\nlest they themselves should suffer reprisals from those people whom\nthey had so maliciously slandered.\n\nHaving uttered these flowers of rhetoric, which were calculated for the\nhearing of her step-dame, who stood with a light at her husband’s back,\nthe young lady assumed an ironical air, and admonished her father to\nsearch every corner of her apartment. She even affected to assist his\ninquiry; with her own hands pulled out a parcel of small drawers, in\nwhich her trinkets were contained; desired him to look into her\nneedlecase and thimble, and, seeing his examination fruitless,\nearnestly intreated him to rummage her closet also, saying, with a\nsneer, that, in all probability, the dishonourer would be found in that\nlurking-place. The manner in which she pretended to ridicule his\napprehensions made an impression upon the jeweller, who was very well\ndisposed to retreat into his own nest, when his wife, with a certain\nslyness in her countenance, besought him to comply with his daughter’s\nrequest, and look into that same closet, by which means Wilhelmina’s\nvirtue would obtain a complete triumph.\n\nOur adventurer, who overheard the conversation, was immediately seized\nwith a palsy of fear. He trembled at every joint, the sweat trickled\ndown his forehead, his teeth began to chatter, his hair to stand on\nend; and he, in his heart, bitterly cursed the daughter’s petulance,\nthe mother’s malice, together with his own precipitation, by which he\nwas involved in an adventure so pregnant with danger and disgrace.\nIndeed, the reader may easily conceive his disorder, when he heard the\nkey turning in the lock, and the German swearing that he would make him\nfood for the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air.\n\nFathom had come unprepared with weapons of defence, was naturally an\neconomist of his person, and saw himself on the brink of forfeiting not\nonly the promised harvest of his double intrigue, but also the\nreputation of a man of honour, upon which all his future hopes\ndepended. His agony was therefore unspeakable, when the door flew open;\nand it was not till after a considerable pause of recollection, that he\nperceived the candle extinguished by the motion of the air produced\nfrom the German’s sudden irruption. This accident, which disconcerted\nhim so much as to put a full stop to his charge, was very favourable to\nour hero, who, summoning all his presence of mind, crept up into the\nchimney, while the jeweller stood at the door, waiting for his wife’s\nreturn with another light; so that, when the closet was examined, there\nwas nothing found to justify the report which the stepmother had made;\nand the father, after having made a slight apology to Wilhelmina for\nhis intrusion, retired with his yoke-fellow into their own chamber.\n\nThe young lady, who little thought that her papa would have taken her\nat her word, was overwhelmed with confusion and dismay, when she saw\nhim enter the closet; and, had her lover been discovered, would, in all\nprobability, have been the loudest in his reproach, and, perhaps, have\naccused him of an intention to rob the house; but she was altogether\nastonished when she found he had made shift to elude the inquiry of her\nparents, because she could not conceive the possibility of his escaping\nby the window, which was in the third storey, at a prodigious distance\nfrom the ground; and how he should conceal himself in the apartment,\nwas a mystery which she could by no means unfold. Before her father and\nmother retired, she lighted her lamp, on pretence of being afraid to be\nin the dark, after the perturbation of spirits she had undergone; and\nher room was no sooner evacuated of such troublesome visitants, than\nshe secured the doors, and went in quest of her lover.\n\nAccordingly, every corner of the closet underwent a new search, and she\ncalled upon his name with a soft voice, which she thought no other\nperson would overhear. But Ferdinand did not think proper to gratify\nher impatience, because he could not judge of the predicament in which\nhe stood by the evidence of all his senses, and would not relinquish\nhis post, until he should be better certified that the coast was clear.\nMeanwhile, his Dulcinea, having performed her inquiry to no purpose,\nimagined there was something preternatural in the circumstance of his\nvanishing so unaccountably, and began to cross herself with great\ndevotion. She returned to her chamber, fixed the lamp in the fireplace,\nand, throwing herself upon the bed, gave way to the suggestions of her\nsuperstition, which were reinforced by the silence that prevailed, and\nthe gloomy glimmering of the light. She reflected upon the trespass she\nhad already committed in her heart, and, in the conjectures of her\nfear, believed that her lover was no other than the devil himself, who\nhad assumed the appearance of Fathom, in order to tempt and seduce her\nvirtue.\n\nWhile her imagination teemed with those horrible ideas, our adventurer,\nconcluding, from the general stillness, that the jeweller and his wife\nwere at last happily asleep, ventured to come forth from his\nhiding-place, and stood before his mistress all begrimed with soot.\nWilhelmina, lifting up her eyes, and seeing this sable apparition,\nwhich she mistook for Satan in propria persona, instantly screamed, and\nbegan to repeat her pater-noster with an audible voice. Upon which\nFerdinand, foreseeing that her parents would be again alarmed, would\nnot stay to undeceive her and explain himself, but, unlocking the door\nwith great expedition, ran downstairs, and luckily accomplished his\nescape. This was undoubtedly the wisest measure he could have taken;\nfor he had not performed one half of his descent toward the street,\nwhen the German was at his daughter’s bedside, demanding to know the\ncause of her exclamation. She then gave him an account of what she had\nseen, with all the exaggerations of her own fancy, and, after having\nweighed the circumstances of her story, he interpreted the apparition\ninto a thief, who had found means to open the door that communicated\nwith the stair; but, having been scared by Wilhelmina’s shriek, had\nbeen obliged to retreat before he could execute his purpose.\n\nOur hero’s spirits were so wofully disturbed by this adventure, that,\nfor a whole week, he felt no inclination to visit his inamorata, and\nwas not without apprehension that the affair had terminated in an\nexplanation very little to his advantage. He was, however, delivered\nfrom this disagreeable suspense, by an accidental meeting with the\njeweller himself, who kindly chid him for his long absence, and\nentertained him in the street with an account of the alarm which his\nfamily had sustained, by a thief who broke into Wilhelmina’s apartment.\nGlad to find his apprehension mistaken, he renewed his correspondence\nwith the family, and, in a little time, found reason to console himself\nfor the jeopardy and panic he had undergone.\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\nHE IS REDUCED TO A DREADFUL DILEMMA, IN CONSEQUENCE OF AN ASSIGNATION\nWITH THE WIFE.\n\nNor was his whole care and attention engrossed by the execution of this\nscheme upon the daughter. While he managed his concerns in that quarter\nwith incredible ardour and application, he was not the less\nindefatigable in the prosecution of his design upon the mother-in-law,\nwhich he forwarded with all his art during those opportunities he\nenjoyed in the absence of Wilhelmina, who was frequently called away by\nthe domestic duties of the house. The passions of the jeweller’s wife\nwere in such a state of exaltation, as exempted our hero from the\nrepulses and fatigue attending a long siege.\n\nWe have already observed how cunningly he catered for the gratification\nof her ruling appetite, and have exhibited pregnant proofs of his\nability in gaining upon the human heart; the reader will not therefore\nbe surprised at the rapidity of his conquest over the affections of a\nlady whose complexion was perfectly amorous, and whose vanity laid her\nopen to all the attempts of adulation. In a word, matters were quickly\nbrought to such a mutual understanding, that, one evening, while they\namused themselves at lansquenet, Fathom conjured her to give him the\nrendezvous next day at the house of any third person of her own sex, in\nwhose discretion she could confide; and, after a few affected scruples\non her side, which he well knew how to surmount, she complied with his\nrequest, and the circumstances of the appointment were settled\naccordingly. After this treaty, their satisfaction rose to such a\nwarmth, and the conversation became so reciprocally endearing, that our\ngallant expressed his impatience of waiting so long for the\naccomplishment of his wishes, and, with the most eager transport,\nbegged she would, if possible, curtail the term of his expectation,\nthat his brain might not suffer by his standing so many tedious hours\non the giddy verge of rapture.\n\nThe dame, who was naturally compassionate, sympathised with his\ncondition, and, unable to resist his pathetic supplications, gave him\nto understand that his desire could not be granted, without subjecting\nthem both to some hazard, but that she was disposed to run any risk in\nbehalf of his happiness and peace. After this affectionate preamble,\nshe told him that her husband was then engaged in a quarterly meeting\nof the jewellers, from whence he never failed to return quite\noverwhelmed with wine, tobacco, and the phlegm of his own constitution;\nso that he would fall fast asleep as soon as his head should touch the\npillow, and she be at liberty to entertain the lover without\ninterruption, provided he could find means to deceive the jealous\nvigilance of Wilhelmina, and conceal himself in some corner of the\nhouse, unsuspected and unperceived.\n\nOur lover, remembering his adventure with the daughter, would have\nwillingly dispensed with this expedient, and began to repent of the\neagerness with which he had preferred his solicitation; but, seeing\nthere was now no opportunity of retracting with honour, he affected to\nenter heartily into the conversation, and, after much canvassing, it\nwas determined, that, while Wilhelmina was employed in the kitchen, the\nmother should conduct our adventurer to the outer door, where he should\npay the compliment of parting, so as to be overheard by the young lady;\nbut, in the meantime, glide softly into the jeweller’s bedchamber,\nwhich was a place they imagined least liable to the effects of a\ndaughter’s prying disposition, and conceal himself in a large press or\nwardrobe, that stood in one corner of the apartment. The scene was\nimmediately acted with great success, and our hero cooped up in his\ncage, where he waited so long, that his desires began to subside, and\nhis imagination to aggravate the danger of his situation.\n\n“Suppose,” said he to himself, “this brutal German, instead of being\nstupefied with wine, should come home inflamed with brandy, to the use\nof which he is sometimes addicted, far from feeling any inclination to\nsleep, he will labour under the most fretful anxiety of watching; every\nirascible particle in his disposition will be exasperated; he will be\noffended with every object that may present itself to his view; and, if\nthere is the least ingredient of jealousy in his temper, it will\nmanifest itself in riot and rage. What if his frenzy should prompt him\nto search his wife’s chamber for gallants? this would certainly be the\nfirst place to which he would direct his inquiry; or, granting this\nsupposition chimerical, I may be seized with an irresistible\ninclination to cough, before he is oppressed with sleep; he may be\nwaked by the noise I shall make in disengaging myself from this\nembarrassed situation; and, finally, I may find it impracticable to\nretire unseen or unheard, after everything else shall have succeeded to\nmy wish.”\n\nThese suggestions did not at all contribute to the quiet of our\nadventurer, who, having waited three whole hours in the most\nuncomfortable suspense, heard the jeweller brought into the room in\nthat very condition which his fears had prognosticated. He had, it\nseems, quarrelled over his cups with another tradesman, and received a\nsalutation on the forehead with a candlestick, which not only left an\nignominious and painful mark upon his countenance, but even disordered\nhis brain to a very dangerous degree of delirium; so that, instead of\nallowing himself quietly to be undressed and put to bed by his wife, he\nanswered all her gentle admonitions and caresses with the most\nopprobrious invectives and obstreperous behaviour; and, though he did\nnot tax her with infidelity to his bed, he virulently accused her of\nextravagance and want of economy; observed, her expensive way of living\nwould bring him to a morsel of bread; and unfortunately recollecting\nthe attempt of the supposed thief, started up from his chair, swearing\nby G—’s mother that he would forthwith arm himself with a brace of\npistols, and search every apartment in the house. “That press,” said\nhe, with great vociferation, “may, for aught I know, be the receptacle\nof some ruffian.”\n\nSo saying, he approached the ark in which Fathom was embarked, and\nexclaiming, “Come forth, Satan,” applied his foot to the door of it,\nwith such violence as threw him from the centre of gravity, and laid\nhim sprawling on his back. This address made such an impression upon\nour adventurer, that he had well-nigh obeyed the summons, and burst\nfrom his concealment, in a desperate effort to escape, without being\nrecognised by the intoxicated German; and indeed, had the application\nbeen repeated, he in all likelihood would have tried the experiment,\nfor by this time his terrors had waxed too strong to be much longer\nsuppressed. From this hazardous enterprise he was, however, exempted by\na lucky accident that happened to his disturber, whose head chancing to\npitch upon the corner of a chair in his fall, he was immediately lulled\ninto a trance, during which the considerate lady, guessing the disorder\nof her gallant, and dreading further interruption, very prudently\nreleased him from his confinement, after she had put out the light, and\nin the dark conveyed him to the door, where he was comforted with the\npromise that she would punctually remember the rendezvous of next day.\n\nShe then invoked the assistance of the servants, who, being waked for\nthe purpose, lifted up their master, and tumbled him into bed, while\nFerdinand hied him home in an universal sweat, blessing himself from\nany future achievement of that sort in a house where he had been twice\nin such imminent danger of life and reputation. Nevertheless, he did\nnot fail to honour the assignation, and avail himself of the\ndisposition his mistress manifested to make him all the recompense in\nher power for the disappointment and chagrin which he had undergone.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\nBUT AT LENGTH SUCCEEDS IN HIS ATTEMPT UPON BOTH.\n\nHaving thus gained a complete victory over the affections of these two\nladies, he began to convert his good fortune to the purposes of that\nprinciple, from which his view was never, no, not for a moment,\ndetached. In other words, he used them as ministers and purveyors to\nhis avarice and fraud. As for the mother-in-law, she was of herself so\nliberal as to anticipate the wishes of any moderate adventurer, and\npresented him with sundry valuable jewels, as memorials of her esteem;\nnor was the daughter backward in such expressions of regard; she\nalready considered his interest as her own, and took frequent\nopportunities of secreting for his benefit certain stray trinkets that\nshe happened to pick up in her excursions within doors.\n\nAll these gratifications he received with demonstrations of infinite\nconstraint and reluctance, and, in the midst of his rapacious\nextortion, acted so cunningly as to impose himself upon both for a\nmiracle of disinterested integrity. Yet, not contented with what he\nthus could earn, and despairing of being able to steer the bark of his\nfortune for any length of time between two such dangerous quicksands,\nhe resolved to profit by the occasion while it lasted, and strike some\nconsiderable stroke at once. A plan was formed in consequence of this\ndetermination, and, at an appointment with the mother in the house of\ntheir female friend, our adventurer appeared with an air of dejection,\nwhich he veiled with a thin cover of forced pleasantry, that his\nmistress might suppose he endeavoured to conceal some mortal chagrin\nthat preyed upon his heart.\n\nThe stratagem succeeded to his wish. She observed his countenance\nbetween whiles overcast, took notice of the involuntary sighs he\nheaved; and, with the most tender expressions of sympathy, conjured him\nto make her acquainted with the cause of his affliction. Instead of\ngratifying her request immediately, he evaded her questions with a\nrespectful reserve, implying, that his love would not suffer him to\nmake her a partner in his sorrow; and this delicacy on his part whetted\nher impatience and concern to such a degree, that, rather than keep her\nin such an agony of doubt and apprehension, he was prevailed upon to\ntell her, that he had been, the preceding night, engaged with a company\nof his fellow-students, where he had made too free with the champagne,\nso that his caution forsook him, and he had been decoyed into play by a\nTyrolese gamester, who stripped him of all his ready money, and\nobtained from him an obligation for two hundred florins, which he could\nnot possibly pay without having recourse to his relation the Count de\nMelvil, who would have just cause to be incensed at his extravagance.\n\nThis information he concluded, by declaring that, cost what it would,\nhe was resolved to make a candid confession of the truth, and throw\nhimself entirely upon the generosity of his patron, who could inflict\nno other punishment than that of discarding him from his favour and\nprotection,—a misfortune which, how grievous soever it might be, he\nshould be able to sustain with fortitude, could he fall upon some\nmethod of satisfying the Tyrolese, who was very importunate and savage\nin his demand. His kind mistress no sooner found out the source of his\ninquietude, than she promised to dry it up, assuring him that next day,\nat the same hour, she would enable him to discharge the debt; so that\nhe might set his heart at ease, and recollect that gaiety which was the\nsoul of her enjoyment.\n\nHe expressed the utmost astonishment at this generous proffer, which,\nhowever, he declined, with an affected earnestness of refusal,\nprotesting, that he should be extremely mortified, if he thought she\nlooked upon him as one of those mercenary gallants who could make such\na sordid use of a lady’s affection. “No, madam,” cried our politician\nin a pathetic strain, “whatever happens, I shall never part with that\ninternal consolation, that conscious honour never fails to yield in the\ndeepest scenes of solitary distress. The attachment I have the honour\nto profess for your amiable person, is not founded on such inglorious\nmotives, but is the genuine result of that generous passion which none\nbut the noble-minded feel, and the only circumstance of this misfortune\nthat I dread to encounter, is the necessity of withdrawing myself for\never from the presence of her whose genial smiles could animate my soul\nagainst all the persecution of adverse fortune.”\n\nThis declamation, accompanied with a profound sigh, served only to\ninflame her desire of extricating him from the difficulty in which he\nwas involved. She exhausted all her eloquence in attempting to persuade\nhim that his refusal was an outrage against her affection. He pretended\nto refute her arguments, and remained unshaken by all the power of her\nsolicitations, until she had recourse to the most passionate\nremonstrances of love, and fell at his feet in the posture of a forlorn\nshepherdess. What he refused to her reason, he granted to her tears,\nbecause his heart was melted by her affliction, and next day\ncondescended to accept of her money, out of pure regard to her\nhappiness and peace.\n\nEncouraged by the success of this achievement, he resolved to practise\nthe same experiment upon Wilhelmina, in hope of extracting an equal\nshare of profit from her simplicity and attachment, and, at their very\nnext nocturnal rendezvous in her chamber, reacted the farce already\nrehearsed, with a small variation, which he thought necessary to\nstimulate the young lady in his behalf. He rightly concluded, that she\nwas by no means mistress of such a considerable sum as he had already\nextorted from her mother, and therefore thought proper to represent\nhimself in the most urgent predicament, that her apprehension, on his\naccount, might be so alarmed as to engage her in some enterprise for\nhis advantage, which otherwise she would never have dreamed of\nundertaking. With this view, after having described his own calamitous\nsituation, in consequence of her pressing entreaties, which he affected\nto evade, he gave her to understand, that there was no person upon\nearth to whom he would have recourse in this emergency; for which\nreason he was determined to rid himself of all his cares at once, upon\nthe friendly point of his own faithful sword.\n\nSuch a dreadful resolution could not fail to operate upon the tender\npassions of his Dulcinea; she was instantly seized with an agony of\nfear and distraction. Her grief manifested itself in a flood of tears,\nwhile she hung round his neck, conjuring him in the most melting terms,\nby their mutual love, in which they had been so happy, to lay aside\nthat fatal determination, which would infallibly involve her in the\nsame fate; for, she took Heaven to witness, that she would not one\nmoment survive the knowledge of his death.\n\nHe was not deficient in expressions of reciprocal regard. He extolled\nher love and tenderness with a most extravagant eulogium, and seemed\nwrung with mortal anguish at the prospect of parting for ever from his\nlovely Wilhelmina; but his honour was a stern and rigid creditor, that\ncould not be appeased, except with his blood; and all the boon she\ncould obtain, by dint of the most woful supplication, was a promise to\ndefer the execution of his baleful purpose for the space of\nfour-and-twenty hours, during which she hoped Heaven would\ncompassionate her sufferings, and inspire her with some contrivance for\ntheir mutual relief. Thus he yielded to her fervent request, rather\nwith a view to calm the present transports of her sorrow, than with any\nexpectation of seeing himself redeemed from his fate by her\ninterposition; such at least were his professions when he took his\nleave, assuring her, that he would not quit his being before he should\nhave devoted a few hours to another interview with the dear object of\nhis love.\n\nHaving thus kindled the train, he did not doubt that the mine of his\ncraft would take effect, and repaired to his own lodging, in full\npersuasion of seeing his aim accomplished, before the time fixed for\ntheir last assignation. His prognostic was next morning verified by the\narrival of a messenger, who brought to him a small parcel, to which was\ncemented, with sealing wax, the following epistle:—\n\n“JEWEL OF MY SOUL!—Scarce had you, last night, quitted my disconsolate\narms, when I happily recollected that there was in my possession a gold\nchain, of value more than sufficient to answer the exigence of your\npresent occasions. It was pledged to my grandfather for two hundred\ncrowns by a knight of Malta, who soon after perished in a sea\nengagement with the enemies of our faith, so that it became the\nproperty of our house, and was bequeathed to me by the old gentleman,\nas a memorial of his particular affection. Upon whom can I more\nproperly bestow it, than him who is already master of my heart! Receive\nit, therefore, from the bearer of this billet, and convert it, without\nscruple, to that use which shall be most conducive to your ease and\nsatisfaction; nor seek, from a true romantic notion of honour, which I\nknow you entertain, to excuse yourself from accepting this testimony of\nmy affection. For I have already sworn before an image of our blessed\nLady, that I will no longer own you as the sovereign of my heart, nor\neven indulge you with another interview, if you reject this mark of\ntenderness and concern from your ever faithful WILHELMINA.”\n\nThe heart of our adventurer began to bound with joy when he surveyed\nthe contents of this letter; and his eyes sparkled with transport at\nsight of the chain, which he immediately perceived to be worth twice\nthe sum she had mentioned. Nevertheless, he would not avail himself,\nwithout further question, of her generosity; but, that same night,\nrepairing to her apartment at the usual hour of meeting, he prostrated\nhimself before her, and counterfeiting extreme agitation of spirit,\nbegged, in the most urgent terms, not even unaccompanied with tears,\nthat she would take back the present, which he tendered for her\nacceptance, and spare him the most insufferable mortification of\nthinking himself exposed to the imputation of being mercenary in his\nlove. Such, he said, was the delicacy of his passion, that he could not\npossibly exist under the apprehension of incurring a censure so\nunworthy of his sentiments; and he would a thousand times sooner\nundergo the persecution of his rancorous creditor, than bear the\nthought of being in the smallest consideration lessened in her esteem;\nnay, so far did he carry his pretensions to punctilio, as to protest,\nthat, should she refuse to quiet the scruples of his honour on this\nscore, her unyielding beneficence would serve only to hasten the\nexecution of his determined purpose, to withdraw himself at once from a\nlife of vanity and misfortune.\n\nThe more pathetically he pleaded for her compliance, the more\nstrenuously did she resist his remonstrances. She advanced all the\narguments her reason, love, and terror could suggest, reminded him of\nher oath, from which he could not suppose she would recede, whatever\nthe consequence might be; and in conclusion vowed to Heaven, with great\nsolemnity and devotion, that she would not survive the news of his\ndeath. Thus the alternative she offered was either to retain the chain\nand be happy in her affection, or forfeit all title to her love, and\ndie in the conviction of having brought his innocent mistress to an\nuntimely grave.\n\nHis fortitude was not proof against this last consideration. “My savage\nhonour,” said he, “would enable me to endure the pangs of eternal\nseparation in the confidence of being endowed with the power of ending\nthese tortures by the energy of my own hand; but the prospect of\nWilhelmina’s death, and that too occasioned by my inflexibility,\ndisarms my soul of all her resolution, swallows up the dictates of my\njealous pride, and fills my bosom with such a gush of tenderness and\nsorrow, as overwhelms the whole economy of my purpose! Yes, enchanting\ncreature! I sacrifice my glory to that irresistible reflection; and,\nrather than know myself the cruel instrument of robbing the world of\nsuch perfection, consent to retain the fatal testimony of your love.”\n\nSo saying, he pocketed the chain, with an air of ineffable\nmortification, and was rewarded for his compliance with the most\nendearing caresses of his Dulcinea, who, amidst the tumults of her joy,\nejaculated a thousand acknowledgments to Heaven for having blessed her\nwith the affection of such a man, whose honour was unrivalled by\nanything but his love.\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\nHIS SUCCESS BEGETS A BLIND SECURITY, BY WHICH HE IS ONCE AGAIN\nWELL-NIGH ENTRAPPED IN HIS DULCINEA’S APARTMENT.\n\nIn this manner did the crafty Fathom turn to account those ingratiating\nqualifications he inherited from nature, and maintain, with incredible\nassiduity and circumspection, an amorous correspondence with two\ndomestic rivals, who watched the conduct of each other with the most\nindefatigable virulence of envious suspicion, until an accident\nhappened, which had well-nigh overturned the bark of his policy, and\ninduced him to alter the course, that he might not be shipwrecked on\nthe rocks that began to multiply in the prosecution of his present\nvoyage.\n\nThe jeweller, who, as a German, wanted neither pride nor ostentation,\nnever failed to celebrate the anniversary of his birth by an annual\nfeast granted to his neighbours and friends; and on these occasions was\naccustomed to wear that chain which, though bequeathed to his daughter,\nhe considered as an ornament appertaining to the family, whereof he\nhimself was head. Accordingly, when the time of this festival revolved,\nhe, as usual, ordered Wilhelmina to surrender it for the day. This\ninjunction, the reader will perceive, our young lady was in no\ncondition to obey; she had, however, foreseen the demand, and contrived\na scheme of behaviour for the occasion, which she forthwith put in\nexecution.\n\nWith an air of uncommon cheerfulness, purposely assumed, she retired to\nher closet, on pretence of complying with his desire, and, having\nemployed a few minutes in rummaging her drawers and disordering her\nmoveables, uttered a loud shriek, that brought her father instantly\ninto the apartment, where he found his daughter tossing about her\nclothes and trinkets with violent demonstrations of disorder and\naffright, and heard her, in a lamentable strain, declare that she was\nrobbed of her chain, and for ever undone. This was so far from being an\nagreeable intimation to the jeweller, that he was struck dumb with\nastonishment and vexation, and it was not till after a long pause that\nhe pronounced the word Sacrament! with an emphasis denoting the most\nmortifying surprise.\n\nSoon as that exclamation escaped from his lips, he flew to the\nescritoire as if instinctively, and, joining Wilhelmina in her\noccupation, tumbled its whole contents upon the floor in a trice.\n\nWhile he was thus employed, in the most expressive silence, the wife of\nhis bosom chanced to pass that way, and seeing them both occupied with\nsuch violence and trepidation, believed at first that they were\ncertainly actuated by the spirit of frenzy; but, when she interposed,\nby asking, with great earnestness, the cause of such transports and\ndistracted behaviour, and heard her husband reply, with an accent of\ndespair, “The chain! the chain of my forefathers is no more!” she\nimmediately justified his emotion, by undergoing the same alarm, and,\nwithout further hesitation, engaged herself in the search, beginning\nwith a song, which might be compared to the hymn of battle among the\nGreeks, or rather more aptly to that which the Spartan females sung\nround the altar of Diana, surnamed Orthian; for it was attended with\nstrange gesticulations, and, in the course of utterance, became so loud\nand shrill, that the guests, who were by this time partly assembled,\nbeing confounded at the clamour, rushed towards the place from whence\nit seemed to proceed, and found their landlord, with his wife and\ndaughter, in the attitudes of distraction and despair.\n\nWhen they understood the nature of the case, they condoled the family\non their misfortune, and would have retired, on the supposition that it\nwould defeat the mirthful intent of their meeting; but the jeweller,\nmustering up his whole temper and hospitality, entreated them to excuse\nhis disorder, and favour him with their company, which, he observed,\nwas now more than ever wanted, to dispel the melancholy ideas inspired\nby his loss. Notwithstanding this apology, and the efforts he made in\nthe sequel to entertain his friends with jollity and good-humour, his\nheart was so linked to the chain, that he could not detach himself from\nthe thoughts of it, which invaded him at short intervals in such qualms\nas effectually spoiled his appetite, and hindered his digestion.\n\nHe revolved within himself the circumstances of his disaster, and, in\ncanvassing all the probable means by which the chain would be stolen,\nconcluded that the deed must have been done by some person in the\nfamily, who, in consequence of having access to his daughter’s chamber,\nhad either found the drawer left open by her carelessness and neglect,\nor found means to obtain a false key, by some waxen impression; for the\nlocks of the escritoire were safe and uninjured. His suspicion being\nthus confined within his own house, sometimes pitched upon his workmen,\nand sometimes upon his wife, who, he thought, was the more likely to\npractise such finesse, as she considered Wilhelmina in the light of a\ndaughter-in-law, whose interest interfered with her own, and who had\noften harangued to him in private on the folly of leaving this very\nchain in the young lady’s possession.\n\nThe more he considered this subject, he thought he saw the more reason\nto attribute the damage he had sustained to the machinations of his\nspouse, who, he did not doubt, was disposed to feather her own nest, at\nthe expense of him and his heirs, and who, with the same honest\nintention, had already secreted, for her private use, those\ninconsiderable jewels which of late had at different times been\nmissing. Aroused by these sentiments, he resolved to retaliate her own\nschemes, by contriving means to visit her cabinet in secret, and, if\npossible, to rob the robber of the spoils she had gathered to his\nprejudice, without coming to any explanation, which might end in\ndomestic turmoils and eternal disquiet.\n\nWhile the husband exercised his reflection in this manner, his innocent\nmate did not allow the powers of her imagination to rest in idleness\nand sloth. Her observations touching the loss of the chain were such as\na suspicious woman, biassed by hatred and envy, would naturally make.\nTo her it seemed highly improbable, that a thing of such value, so\ncarefully deposited, should vanish without the connivance of its\nkeeper, and without much expense of conjecture, divined the true manner\nin which it was conveyed. The sole difficulty that occurred in the\nresearches of her sagacity, was to know the gallant who had been\nfavoured with such a pledge of Wilhelmina’s affection; for, as the\nreader will easily imagine, she never dreamed of viewing Ferdinand in\nthat odious perspective. In order to satisfy her curiosity, discover\nthis happy favourite, and be revenged on her petulant rival, she\nprevailed upon the jeweller to employ a scout, who should watch all\nnight upon the stair, without the knowledge of any other person in the\nfamily, alleging, that in all likelihood, the housemaid gave private\nadmittance to some lover who was the author of all the losses they had\nlately suffered, and that they might possibly detect him in his\nnocturnal adventures; and observing that it would be imprudent to\nintimate their design to Wilhelmina, lest, through the heedlessness and\nindiscretion of youth, she might chance to divulge the secret, so as to\nfrustrate their aim.\n\nA Swiss, in whose honesty the German could confide, being hired for\nthis purpose, was posted in a dark corner of the staircase, within a\nfew paces of the door, which he was directed to watch, and actually\nstood sentinel three nights, without perceiving the least object of\nsuspicion; but, on the fourth, the evil stars of our adventurer\nconducted him to the spot, on his voyage to the apartment of his\nDulcinea, with whom he had preconcerted the assignation. Having made\nthe signal, which consisted of two gentle taps on her door, he was\nimmediately admitted; and the Swiss no sooner saw him fairly housed,\nthan he crept softly to the other door, that was left open for the\npurpose, and gave immediate intimation of what he had perceived. This\nintelligence, however, he could not convey so secretly, but the lovers,\nwho were always vigilant upon these occasions, overheard a sort of\ncommotion in the jeweller’s chamber, the cause of which their\napprehension was ingenious enough to comprehend.\n\nWe have formerly observed that our adventurer could not make his\nretreat by the door, without running a very great risk of being\ndetected, and the expedient of the chimney he had no inclination to\nrepeat; so that he found himself in a very uncomfortable dilemma, and\nwas utterly abandoned by all his invention and address, when his\nmistress, in a whisper, desired him to begin a dialogue, aloud, in an\napology, importing, that he had mistaken the door, and that his\nintention was to visit her father, touching a ring belonging to the\nyoung Count Melvil, which she knew Fathom had put into his hands, in\norder to be altered.\n\nFerdinand, seizing the hint, availed himself of it without delay, and,\nunbolting the door, pronounced in an audible voice, “Upon my honour,\nMademoiselle, you wrong my intention, if you imagine I came hither with\nany disrespectful or dishonourable motive. I have business with your\nfather, which cannot be delayed till to-morrow, without manifest\nprejudice to my friend and myself; therefore I took the liberty of\nvisiting him at these untimely hours, and it has been my misfortune to\nmistake the door in the dark. I beg pardon for my involuntary\nintrusion, and again assure you, that nothing was farther from my\nthoughts than any design to violate that respect which I have always\nentertained for you and your father’s family.”\n\nTo this remonstrance, which was distinctly heard by the German and his\nwife, who by this time stood listening at the door, the young lady\nreplied, in a shrill accent of displeasure, “Sir, I am bound to believe\nthat all your actions are conducted by honour; but you must give me\nleave to tell you, that your mistake is a little extraordinary, and\nyour visit, even to my father, at this time of the night, altogether\nunseasonable, if not mysterious. As for the interruption I have\nsuffered in my repose, I impute it to my own forgetfulness, in leaving\nmy door unlocked, and blame myself so severely for the omission, that I\nshall, to-morrow, put it out of my own power to be guilty of the like\nfor the future, by ordering the passage to be nailed up; meanwhile, if\nyou would persuade me of your well-meaning, you will instantly\nwithdraw, lest my reputation should suffer by your continuance in my\napartment.”\n\n“Madam,” answered our hero, “I will not give you an opportunity to\nrepeat the command, which I shall forthwith obey, after having\nentreated you once more to forgive the disturbance I have given.” So\nsaying, he gently opened the door, and, at sight of the German and his\nwife, who, he well knew, waited for his exit, started back, and gave\ntokens of confusion, which was partly real and partly affected. The\njeweller, fully satisfied with Fathom’s declaration to his daughter,\nreceived him with a complaisant look, and, in order to alleviate his\nconcern, gave him to understand, that he already knew the reason of his\nbeing in that apartment, and desired to be informed of what had\nprocured him the honour to see him at such a juncture.\n\n“My dear friend,” said our adventurer, pretending to recollect himself\nwith difficulty, “I am utterly ashamed and confounded to be discovered\nin this situation; but, as you have overheard what passed between\nMademoiselle and me, I know you will do justice to my intention, and\nforgive my mistake. After begging pardon for having intruded upon your\nfamily at these hours, I must now tell you that my cousin, Count\nMelvil, was some time ago so much misrepresented to his mother by\ncertain malicious informers, who delight in sowing discord in private\nfamilies, that she actually believed her son an extravagant\nspendthrift, who had not only consumed his remittances in the most\nriotous scenes of disorder, but also indulged a pernicious appetite for\ngaming, to such a degree, that he had lost all his clothes and jewels\nat play. In consequence of such false information, she expostulated\nwith him in a severe letter, and desired he would transmit to her that\nring which is in your custody, it being a family stone, for which she\nexpressed an inestimable value. The young gentleman, in his answer to\nher reproof, endeavoured to vindicate himself from the aspersions which\nhad been cast upon his character, and, with regard to the ring, told\nher it was at present in the hands of a jeweller, in order to be new\nset according to her own directions, and that, whenever it should be\naltered, he would send it home to her by some safe conveyance. This\naccount the good lady took for an evasion, and upon that supposition\nhas again written to him, in such a provoking style, that, although the\nletter arrived but half an hour ago, he is determined to despatch a\ncourier before morning with the mischievous ring, for which, in\ncompliance with the impetuosity of his temper, I have taken the freedom\nto disturb you at this unseasonable hour.”\n\nThe German paid implicit faith to every circumstance of his story,\nwhich indeed could not well be supposed to be invented extempore; the\nring was immediately restored, and our adventurer took his leave,\ncongratulating himself upon his signal deliverance from the snare in\nwhich he had fallen.\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\nTHE STEP-DAME’S SUSPICIONS BEING AWAKENED, SHE LAYS A SNARE FOR OUR\nADVENTURER, FROM WHICH HE IS DELIVERED BY THE INTERPOSITION OF HIS GOOD\nGENIUS.\n\nThough the husband swallowed the bait without further inquiry, the\npenetration of the wife was not so easily deceived. That same dialogue\nin Wilhelmina’s apartment, far from allaying, rather inflamed her\nsuspicion; because, in the like emergency, she herself had once\nprofited by the same, or nearly the same contrivance. Without\ncommunicating her doubts to the father, she resolved to double her\nattention to the daughter’s future conduct, and keep such a strict eye\nover the behaviour of our gallant, that he should find it very\ndifficult, if not impossible, to elude her observation. For this\npurpose she took into her pay an old maiden, of the right sour\ndisposition, who lived in a house opposite to her own, and directed her\nto follow the young lady in all her outgoings, whenever she should\nreceive from the window a certain signal, which the mother-in-law\nagreed to make for the occasion. It was not long before this scheme\nsucceeded to her wish. The door of communication betwixt Wilhelmina’s\napartment and the staircase being nailed up by the jeweller’s express\norder, our adventurer was altogether deprived of those opportunities he\nhad hitherto enjoyed, and was not at all mortified to find himself so\nrestricted in a correspondence which began to be tiresome and\ndisagreeable. But the case was far otherwise with his Dulcinea, whose\npassion, the more it was thwarted, raged with greater violence, like a\nfire, that, from the attempts that are made to extinguish it, gathers\ngreater force, and flames with double fury.\n\nUpon the second day of her misfortune, she had written a very tender\nbillet, lamenting her unhappiness in being deprived of those meetings\nwhich constituted the chief joy of her life, and entreating him to\ncontrive some means of renewing the delicious commerce in an\nunsuspected place. This intimation she proposed to convey privately\ninto the hand of her lover, during his next visit to the family; but\nboth were so narrowly eyed by the mother, that she found the execution\nof her design impracticable; and next forenoon, on pretence of going to\nchurch, repaired to the house of a companion, who, being also her\nconfidant, undertook to deliver the billet with her own hand.\n\nThe she-dragon employed by her mother, in obedience to the sign which\nwas displayed from the window immediately put on her veil, and followed\nWilhelmina at a distance, until she saw her fairly housed. She would\nnot even then return from her excursion, but hovered about in sight of\nthe door, with a view of making further observations. In less than five\nminutes after the young lady disappeared, the scout perceived her\ncoming out, accompanied by her comrade, from whom she instantly parted,\nand bent her way towards the church in good earnest, while the other\nsteered her course in another direction. The duenna, after a moment’s\nsuspense and consideration, divined the true cause of this short visit,\nand resolved to watch the motions of the confidant, whom she traced to\nthe academy in which our hero lodged, and from which she saw her\nreturn, after the supposed message was delivered.\n\nFraught with this intelligence, the rancorous understrapper hied her\nhome to the jeweller’s wife, and made a faithful recital of what she\nhad seen, communicating at the same time her own conjectures on that\nsubject. Her employer was equally astonished and incensed at this\ninformation. She was seized with all that frenzy which takes possession\nof a slighted woman, when she finds herself supplanted by a detested\nrival; and, in the first transports of her indignation, devoted them as\nsacrifices to her vengeance. Nor was her surprise so much the effect of\nhis dissimulation, as of his want of taste and discernment. She\ninveighed against him, not as the most treacherous lover, but as the\nmost abject wretch, in courting the smiles of such an awkward dowdy,\nwhile he enjoyed the favours of a woman who had numbered princes in the\ntrain of her admirers. For the brilliancy of her attractions, such as\nthey at present shone, she appealed to the decision of her minister,\nwho consulted her own satisfaction and interest, by flattering the\nother’s vanity and resentment; and so unaccountable did the depravity\nof our hero’s judgment appear to this conceited dame, that she began to\nbelieve there was some mistake in the person, and to hope that\nWilhelmina’s gallant was not in reality her professed admirer, Mr.\nFathom, but rather one of his fellow-lodgers, whose passion he favoured\nwith his mediation and assistance.\n\nOn this notion, which nothing but mere vanity could have inspired, in\nopposition to so many more weighty presumptions, she took the\nresolution of bringing the affair to a fuller explanation, before she\nwould concert any measures to the prejudice of our adventurer, and\nforthwith despatched her spy back to his lodgings, to solicit, on the\npart of Wilhelmina, an immediate answer to the letter he had received.\nThis was an expedition with which the old maiden would have willingly\ndispensed, because it was founded upon an uncertainty, which might be\nattended with troublesome consequences; but, rather than be the means\nof retarding a negotiation so productive of that sort of mischief which\nis particularly agreeable to all of her tribe, she undertook to manage\nand effect the discovery, in full confidence of her own talents and\nexperience.\n\nWith such a fund of self-sufficiency and instigation, she repaired to\nthe academy on the instant, and inquiring for Mr. Fathom, was\nintroduced to his apartment, where she found him in the very act of\nwriting a billet to the jeweller’s daughter. The artful agent having\nasked, with the mysterious air of an expert go-between, if he had not\nlately received a message from a certain young lady, and, being\nanswered in the affirmative, gave him to understand, that she herself\nwas a person favoured with the friendship and confidence of Wilhelmina,\nwhom she had known from her cradle, and often dandled on her knee;\nthen, in the genuine style of a prattling dry nurse, she launched out\nin encomiums on his Dulcinea’s beauty and sweetness of temper,\nrecounting many simple occurrences of her infancy and childhood; and,\nfinally, desiring a more circumstantial answer to that which she had\nsent to him by her friend Catherina. In the course of her loquacity she\nhad also, according to her instructions, hinted at the misfortune of\nthe door; and, on the whole, performed her cue with such dexterity and\ndiscretion that our politician was actually overreached, and, having\nfinished his epistle, committed it to her care, with many verbal\nexpressions of eternal love and fidelity to his charming Wilhelmina.\n\nThe messenger, doubly rejoiced at her achievement, which not only\nrecommended her ministry, but also gratified her malice, returned to\nher principal with great exultation, and, delivering the letter, the\nreader will easily conceive the transports of that lady when she read\nthe contents of it in these words:—\n\n“ANGELIC WILHELMINA!—To forget those ecstatic scenes we have enjoyed\ntogether, or even live without the continuation of that mutual bliss,\nwere to quit all title to perception, and resign every hope of future\nhappiness. No! my charmer, while my head retains the least spark of\ninvention, and my heart glows with the resolution of a man, our\ncorrespondence shall not be cut off by the machinations of an envious\nstepmother, who never had attractions to inspire a generous passion;\nand, now that age and wrinkles have destroyed what little share of\nbeauty she once possessed, endeavours, like the fiend in paradise, to\nblast those joys in others, from which she is herself eternally\nexcluded. Doubt not, dear sovereign of my soul! that I will study, with\nall the eagerness of desiring love, how to frustrate her malicious\nintention, and renew those transporting moments, the remembrance of\nwhich now warms the breast of your ever constant FATHOM.”\n\nHad our hero murdered her father, or left her a disconsolate widow, by\neffecting the death of her dear husband, there might have been a\npossibility of her exerting the Christian virtues of resignation and\nforgiveness; but such a personal outrage as that contained in this\nepistle precluded all hope of pardon, and rendered penitence of no\nsignification. His atrocious crime being now fully ascertained, this\nvirago gave a loose to her resentment, which became so loud and\ntempestuous, that her informer shuddered at the storm she had raised,\nand began to repent of having communicated the intelligence which\nseemed to have such a violent effect upon her brain.\n\nShe endeavoured, however, to allay the agitation, by flattering her\nfancy with the prospect of revenge, and gradually soothed her into a\nstate of deliberate ire; during which she determined to take ample\nvengeance on the delinquent. In the zenith of her rage, she would have\nhad immediate recourse to poison or steel, had she not been diverted\nfrom her mortal purpose by her counsellor, who represented the danger\nof engaging in such violent measures, and proposed a more secure\nscheme, in the execution of which she would see the perfidious wretch\nsufficiently punished, without any hazard to her own person or\nreputation. She advised her to inform the jeweller of Fathom’s efforts\nto seduce her conjugal fidelity, and impart to him a plan, by which he\nwould have it in his power to detect our adventurer in the very act of\npractising upon her virtue.\n\nThe lady relished her proposal, and actually resolved to make an\nassignation with Ferdinand, as usual, and give notice of the\nappointment to her husband, that he might personally discover the\ntreachery of his pretended friend, and inflict upon him such\nchastisement as the German’s brutal disposition should suggest, when\ninflamed by that species of provocation. Had this project been brought\nto bear, Ferdinand, in all likelihood, would have been disqualified\nfrom engaging in any future intrigue; but fate ordained that the design\nshould be defeated, in order to reserve him for more important\noccasions.\n\nBefore the circumstances of the plan could be adjusted, it was his good\nfortune to meet his Dulcinea in the street, and, in the midst of their\nmutual condolence on the interruption they had suffered in their\ncorrespondence, he assured her, that he would never give his invention\nrespite, until he should have verified the protestations contained in\nthe letter he had delivered to her discreet agent. This allusion to a\nbillet she had never received, did not fail to alarm her fears, and\nintroduce a very mortifying explanation, in which he so accurately\ndescribed the person of the messenger, that she forthwith comprehended\nthe plot, and communicated to our hero her sentiments on that subject.\n\nThough he expressed infinite anxiety and chagrin at this misfortune,\nwhich could not fail to raise new obstacles to their love, his heart\nwas a stranger to the uneasiness he affected; and rather pleased with\nthe occasion, which would furnish him with pretences to withdraw\nhimself gradually from an intercourse by this time become equally\ncloying and unprofitable. Being well acquainted with the mother’s\ntemperament, he guessed the present situation of her thoughts, and\nconcluding she would make the jeweller a party in her revenge, he\nresolved from that moment to discontinue his visits, and cautiously\nguard against any future interview with the lady whom he had rendered\nso implacable.\n\nIt was well for our adventurer that his good fortune so seasonably\ninterposed; for that same day, in the afternoon, he was favoured with a\nbillet from the jeweller’s wife, couched in the same tender style she\nhad formerly used, and importing an earnest desire of seeing him next\nday at the wonted rendezvous. Although his penetration was sufficient\nto perceive the drift of this message, or at least to discern the risk\nhe should run in complying with her request, yet he was willing to be\nmore fully certified of the truth of his suspicion, and wrote an answer\nto the billet, in which he assured her, that he would repair to the\nplace of appointment with all the punctuality of an impatient lover.\nNevertheless, instead of performing this promise, he, in the morning,\ntook post in a public-house opposite to the place of assignation, in\norder to reconnoitre the ground, and about noon had the pleasure of\nseeing the German, wrapped in a cloak, enter the door of his wife’s\nshe-friend, though the appointment was fixed at five in the evening.\nFathom blessed his good angel for having conducted him clear of this\nconspiracy, and kept his station with great tranquillity till the hour\nof meeting, when he beheld his enraged Thalestris take the same route,\nand enjoyed her disappointment with ineffable satisfaction.\n\nThus favoured with a pretext, he took his leave of her, in a letter,\ngiving her to understand, that he was no stranger to the barbarous\nsnare she had laid for him; and upbraiding her with having made such an\nungrateful return for all his tenderness and attachment. She was not\nbackward in conveying a reply to this expostulation, which seemed to\nhave been dictated in all the distraction of a proud woman who sees her\nvengeance baffled, as well as her love disdained. Her letter was\nnothing but a succession of reproaches, menaces, and incoherent\nexecrations. She taxed him with knavery, insensibility, and\ndissimulation; imprecated a thousand curses upon his head, and\nthreatened not only to persecute his life with all the arts that hell\nand malice could inspire, but also to wound him in the person of her\ndaughter-in-law, who should be enclosed for life in a convent, where\nshe should have leisure to repent of those loose and disorderly\npractices which he had taught her to commit, and of which she could not\npretend innocence, as they had it in their power to confront her with\nthe evidence of her lover’s own confession. Yet all this denunciation\nwas qualified with an alternative, by which he was given to understand,\nthat the gates of mercy were still open, and that penitence was capable\nof washing out the deepest stain of guilt.\n\nFerdinand read the whole remonstrance with great composure and\nmoderation, and was content to incur the hazard of her hate, rather\nthan put her to the trouble of making such an effort of generosity, as\nwould induce her to forgive the heinous offence he had committed; nor\ndid his apprehension for Wilhelmina in the least influence his\nbehaviour on this occasion. So zealous was he for her spiritual\nconcerns, that he would have been glad to hear she had actually taken\nthe veil; but he knew such a step was not at all agreeable to her\ndisposition, and that no violence would be offered to her inclinations\non that score, unless her stepmother should communicate to the father\nthat letter of Fathom’s which she had intercepted, and by which the\nGerman would be convinced of his daughter’s backsliding; but this\nmeasure, he rightly supposed, the wife would not venture to take, lest\nthe husband, instead of taking her advice touching the young lady,\nshould seek to compromise the affair, by offering her in marriage to\nher debaucher, a proffer which, if accepted, would overwhelm the mother\nwith vexation and despair. He therefore chose to trust to the effects\nof lenient time, which he hoped would gradually weaken the resentment\nof this Penthesilea, and dissolve his connexion with the other parts of\nthe family, from which he longed to be totally detached.\n\nHow well soever he might have succeeded in his attempts to shake off\nthe yoke of the mother, who by her situation in life was restrained\nfrom prosecuting those measures her resentment had planned against his\nfortitude and indifference, he would have found greater difficulty than\nhe had foreseen, in disengaging himself from the daughter, whose\naffections he had won under the most solemn professions of honour and\nfidelity, and who, now she was debarred of his company and\nconversation, and in danger of losing him for ever, had actually taken\nthe resolution of disclosing the amour to her father, that he might\ninterpose in behalf of her peace and reputation, and secure her\nhappiness by the sanction of the church.\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\nOUR HERO DEPARTS FROM VIENNA, AND QUITS THE DOMAIN OF VENUS FOR THE\nROUGH FIELD OF MARS.\n\nLuckily for our adventurer, before she adhered to this determination,\nthe young Count de Melvil was summoned to Presburg by his father, who\ndesired to see him, before he should take the field, in consequence of\na rupture between the Emperor and the French King; and Fathom of course\nquitted Vienna, in order to attend his patron, after he and Renaldo had\nresided two whole years in that capital, where the former had made\nhimself perfect in all the polite exercises, become master of the\nFrench tongue, and learned to speak the Italian with great facility;\nover and above those other accomplishments in which we have represented\nhim as an inimitable original.\n\nAs for the young Count, his exteriors were so much improved by the\ncompany to which he had access, since his departure from his father’s\nhouse, that his parents were equally surprised and overjoyed at the\nalteration. All that awkwardness and rusticity, which hung upon his\ndeportment, was, like the rough coat of a diamond, polished away; the\nconnexion and disposition of his limbs seemed to have been adjusted\nanew; his carriage was become easy, his air perfectly genteel, and his\nconversation gay and unrestrained. The merit of this reformation was in\na great measure ascribed to the care and example of Mr. Fathom, who was\nreceived by the old Count and his lady with marks of singular\nfriendship and esteem; nor was he overlooked by Mademoiselle, who still\nremained in a state of celibacy, and seemed to have resigned all hope\nof altering her condition; she expressed uncommon satisfaction at the\nreturn of her old favourite, and readmitted him into the same degree of\nfamiliarity with which he had been honoured before his departure.\n\nThe joy of Teresa was so excessive at his arrival, that she could\nscarce suppress her raptures, so as to conceal them from the notice of\nthe family; and our hero, upon this occasion, performed the part of an\nexquisite actor, in dissembling those transports which his bosom never\nknew. So well had this pupil retained the lessons of her instructor,\nthat, in the midst of those fraudulent appropriations, which she still\ncontinued to make, she had found means to support her interest and\ncharacter with Mademoiselle, and even to acquire such influence in the\nfamily, that no other servant, male or female, could pretend to live\nunder the same roof, without paying incessant homage to this artful\nwaiting-woman, and yielding the most abject submission to her will.\n\nThe young gentlemen having tarried at Presburg about six weeks, during\nwhich a small field equipage was prepared for Renaldo, they repaired to\nthe camp at Heilbron, under the auspices of Count Melvil, in whose\nregiment they carried arms as volunteers, with a view to merit\npromotion in the service by their own personal behaviour. Our\nadventurer would have willingly dispensed with this occasion of\nsignalising himself, his talents being much better adapted to another\nsphere of life; nevertheless, he affected uncommon alacrity at the\nprospect of gathering laurels in the field, and subscribed to his\nfortune with a good grace; foreseeing, that even in a campaign, a man\nof his art and ingenuity might find means to consult his corporal\nsafety, without any danger to his reputation. Accordingly, before he\nhad lived full three weeks in camp, the damp situation, and sudden\nchange in his way of life, had such a violent effect upon his\nconstitution, that he was deprived of the use of all his limbs, and\nmourned, without ceasing, his hard fate, by which he found himself\nprecluded from all opportunity of exerting his diligence, courage, and\nactivity, in the character of a soldier, to which he now aspired.\n\nRenaldo, who was actually enamoured of a martial life, and missed no\noccasion of distinguishing himself, consoled his companion with great\ncordiality, encouraged him with the hope of seeing his constitution\nfamiliarised to the inconveniences of a camp, and accommodated him with\neverything which he thought would alleviate the pain of his body, as\nwell as the anxiety of his mind. The old Count, who sincerely\nsympathised with his affliction, would have persuaded him to retire\ninto quarters, where he could be carefully nursed, and provided with\neverything necessary to a person in his condition; but such was his\ndesire of glory, that he resisted his patron’s importunities with great\nconstancy, till at length, seeing the old gentleman obstinately\ndetermined to consult his health by removing him from the field, he\ngradually suffered himself to recover the use of his hands, made shift\nto sit up in his bed, and amuse himself with cards or backgammon, and,\nnotwithstanding the feeble condition of his legs, ventured to ride out\non horseback to visit the lines, though the Count and his son would\nnever yield to his solicitations so far, as to let him accompany\nRenaldo in those excursions and reconnoitring parties, by which a\nvolunteer inures himself to toil and peril, and acquires that knowledge\nin the operations of war, which qualifies him for a command in the\nservice.\n\nNotwithstanding this exemption from all duty, our adventurer managed\nmatters so as to pass for a youth of infinite mettle, and even rendered\nhis backwardness and timidity subservient to the support of that\ncharacter, by expressing an impatience of lying inactive, and a desire\nof signalising his prowess, which even the disabled condition of his\nbody could scarce restrain. He must be a man of very weak nerves and\nexcessive irresolution, who can live in the midst of actual service,\nwithout imbibing some portion of military fortitude: danger becomes\nhabitual, and loses a great part of its terror; and as fear is often\ncaught by contagion, so is courage communicated among the individuals\nof an army. The hope of fame, desire of honours and preferment, envy,\nemulation, and the dread of disgrace, are motives which co-operate in\nsuppressing that aversion to death or mutilation, which nature hath\nimplanted in the human mind; and therefore it is not to be wondered at,\nif Fathom, who was naturally chicken-hearted, gained some advantages\nover his disposition before the end of the campaign, which happened to\nbe neither perilous nor severe.\n\nDuring the winter, while both armies remained in quarters, our\nadventurer attended his patron to Presburg, and, before the troops were\nin motion, Renaldo obtained a commission, in consequence of which he\nwent into garrison at Philipsburg, whither he was followed by our hero,\nwhile the old Count’s duty called him to the field in a different\nplace. Ferdinand for some time had no reason to be dissatisfied with\nthis disposition, by which he was at once delivered from the fatigues\nof a campaign, and the inspection of a severe censor, in the person of\nCount Melvil; and his satisfaction was still increased by an accidental\nmeeting with the Tyrolese who had been his confederate at Vienna, and\nnow chanced to serve in garrison on the same footing with himself.\nThese two knights-errant renewed their former correspondence, and, as\nall soldiers are addicted to gaming, levied contributions upon all\nthose officers who had money to lose, and temerity to play.\n\nHowever, they had not long pursued this branch of traffic, when their\nsuccess was interrupted by a very serious occurrence, that for the\npresent entirely detached the gentlemen in the garrison from such\namusements. The French troops invested Fort Kehl, situated on the\nRhine, opposite to Strasburg; and the Imperialists, dreading that the\nnext storm would fall upon Philipsburg, employed themselves with great\ndiligence to put that important fortress in a proper posture of\ndefence. If the suspension of play was displeasing to our hero, the\nexpectation of being besieged was by no means more agreeable. He knew\nthe excellence of the French engineers, the power of their artillery,\nand the perseverance of their general. He felt, by anticipation, the\ntoils of hard duty upon the works, the horrors of night-alarms,\ncannonading, bombardment, sallies, and mines blown up; and deliberated\nwith himself whether or not he should privately withdraw, and take\nrefuge among the besiegers; but, when he reflected that such a step,\nbesides the infamy that must attend it, would be like that of running\nupon Scylla, seeking to avoid Charybdis, as he would be exposed to more\ndanger and inconvenience in the trenches than he could possibly undergo\nin the town, and after all run the risk of being taken and treated as a\ndeserter; upon these considerations he resolved to submit himself to\nhis destiny, and endeavoured to mitigate the rigour of his fate by\nthose arts he had formerly practised with success. He accordingly found\nmeans to enjoy a very bad state of health during the whole siege, which\nlasted about six weeks after the trenches were opened; and then the\ngarrison marched out by capitulation, with all the honours of war.\n\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\n\nHE PUTS HIMSELF UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF HIS ASSOCIATE, AND STUMBLES UPON\nTHE FRENCH CAMP, WHERE HE FINISHES HIS MILITARY CAREER.\n\nNothing else of moment was transacted during that campaign; and in the\nwinter our adventurer, with the young Count, and his friend the\nTyrolese, were disposed in quarters of cantonment, where Ferdinand made\nhimself amends for the chagrin he had undergone, by the exercise of\nthose talents in which he excelled. Not that he was satisfied with the\nsphere of life in which he acted; though he knew himself consummate in\nthe art of play, he was not at all ambitious of a gamester’s name; nor\ndid he find himself disposed to hazard those discoveries and\nexplanations to which heroes of that class are sometimes necessarily\nexposed. His aim was to dwell among the tents of civil life,\nundisturbed by quarrels and the din of war, and render mankind\nsubservient to his interest, not by stratagems which irritate, but by\nthat suppleness of insinuation, which could not fail to soothe the\ntemper of those on whom he meant to prey.\n\nHe saw that all his expectations of Count Melvil’s future favour were\nconnected with his choice of a military life; and that his promotion in\nthe service would, in a great measure, depend upon his personal\nbehaviour in such emergencies as he did not at all wish to encounter.\nOn the other hand, he confided so much in his own dexterity and\naddress, that he never doubted of being able to rear a splendid fortune\nfor himself, provided he could once obtain a fixed and firm foundation.\nHe had in fancy often enjoyed a prospect of England, not only as his\nnative country, to which, like a true citizen, he longed to be united;\nbut also as the land of promise, flowing with milk and honey, and\nabounding with subjects on which he knew his talents would be properly\nexercised.\n\nThese reflections never occurred, without leaving a strong impression\nupon the mind of our adventurer, which influenced his deliberations in\nsuch a manner, as at length amounted to a perfect resolution of\nwithdrawing himself privately from a service that teemed with\ndisagreeable events, and of transporting himself into the country of\nhis ancestors, which he considered as the Canaan of all able\nadventurers. But, previous to his appearance on that stage, he was\ndesirous of visiting the metropolis of France, in which he hoped to\nimprove himself in the knowledge of men and things, and acquire such\nintelligence as would qualify him to act a more important part upon the\nBritish scene. After having for some time indulged these prospects in\nsecret, he determined to accommodate himself with the company and\nexperience of the Tyrolese, whom, under the specious title of an\nassociate, he knew he could convert into a very serviceable tool, in\nforwarding the execution of his own projects.\n\nAccordingly, the inclination of this confederate was sounded by distant\nhints, and being found apt, our hero made him privy to his design of\ndecamping without beat of drum; though, at the same time, he begged his\nadvice touching the method of their departure, that he might retire\nwith as much delicacy as the nature of such a step would permit. Divers\nconsultations were held upon this subject, before they adhered to the\nresolution of making their escape from the army, after it should have\ntaken the field in the spring; because, in that case, they would have\nfrequent opportunities of going abroad on foraging parties, and, during\none of these excursions, might retire in such a manner as to persuade\ntheir companions that they had fallen into the enemy’s hands.\n\nAgreeable to this determination, the camp was no sooner formed in\nAlsace than our associates began to make preparations for their march,\nand had already taken all the previous measures for their departure,\nwhen an accident happened, which our hero did not fail to convert to\nhis own advantage. This was no other than the desertion of Renaldo’s\nvalet, who, in consequence of a gentle chastisement, which he had\nrichly merited, thought proper to disappear, after having plundered his\nmaster’s portmanteau, which he had forced open for the purpose.\nFerdinand, who was the first person that discovered the theft,\nimmediately comprehended the whole adventure, and, taking it for\ngranted that the delinquent would never return, resolved to finish what\nthe fugitive had imperfectly performed.\n\nBeing favoured with the unreserved confidence of the young Count, he\ninstantly had recourse to his bureau, the locks of which he found means\nto burst open, and, examining a private drawer, contrived with great\nart to conceal Renaldo’s jewels and cash, made himself master of the\ncontents without hesitation; then cutting open his cloak-bag, and\nstrewing the tent with his linen and clothes, began to raise his voice,\nand produce such a clamour as alarmed the whole neighbourhood, and\nbrought a great many officers into the tent.\n\nHe on this, as on all other occasions, performed his cue to a miracle,\nexpressing confusion and concern so naturally in his gestures and\nexclamation, that no man could possibly suspect his sincerity; nay, to\nsuch a degree of finesse did his cunning amount, that when his friend\nand patron entered, in consequence of an intimation he soon received of\nhis loss, our adventurer exhibited undoubted signs of distraction and\ndelirium, and, springing upon Renaldo with all the frantic fury of a\nbedlamite, “Villain,” cried he, “restore the effects you have stole\nfrom your master, or you shall be immediately committed to the care of\nthe prevot.” However mortified M. de Melvil might be at his own\nmisfortune, the condition of his friend seemed to touch him more\nnearly; he undervalued his own loss as a trifle that could be easily\nrepaired; said everything which he thought would tend to soothe and\ncompose the agitation of Ferdinand; and finally prevailed upon him to\nretire to rest. The calamity was wholly attributed to the deserter; and\nRenaldo, far from suspecting the true author, took occasion, from his\nbehaviour on this emergency, to admire him as a mirror of integrity and\nattachment; in such an exquisite manner did he plan all his designs,\nthat almost every instance of his fraud furnished matter of triumph to\nhis reputation.\n\nHaving thus profitably exercised his genius, this subtle politician\nthought it high time to relinquish his military expectations, and\nsecuring all his valuable acquisitions about his own person, rode out\nwith his understrapper, in the midst of fifty dragoons, who went in\nquest of forage. While the troopers were employed in making up their\ntrusses, the two adventurers advanced towards the skirt of a wood, on\npretence of reconnoitring, and the Tyrolese, who undertook to be our\nhero’s guide, directing him to a path which leads towards Strasburg,\nthey suddenly vanished from the eyes of their companions, who in a few\nminutes hearing the report of several pistols, which the confederates\npurposely fired, conjectured that they had fallen in with a party of\nFrench, by whom they were made prisoners of war.\n\nThe Tyrolese had overrated his own knowledge when he took upon himself\nthe charge of conducting our hero; for upon their arrival at a certain\nplace, where two roads crossed each other, he chanced to follow that\nwhich not only frustrated their intention, but even led them directly\nto the French camp; so that, in the twilight, they fell in upon one of\nthe outguards before they were aware of their mistake.\n\nWhatever confusion and perplexity they might undergo, when they heard\nthemselves questioned by the sentinel on the advanced post, certain it\nis, they betrayed no symptoms of fear or disorder; but while Ferdinand\nendeavoured to recollect himself, his fellow-traveller, with the\nappearance of admirable intrepidity and presence of mind, told the\nsoldier that he and his companion were two gentlemen of family, who had\nquitted the Austrian army, on account of having sustained some\nill-usage, which they had no opportunity of resenting in any other way,\nand that they were come to offer their services to the French general,\nto whose quarters they desired to be immediately conveyed.\n\nThe sentinel, to whom such an instance of desertion was neither rare,\nnor indeed uncommon, directed them without scruple to the next post,\nwhere they found a serjeant’s party, from which, at their request, they\nwere transmitted to the officer of the grand guard, and by him next\nmorning introduced to Count Coigny, who very politely received them as\nvolunteers in the army of France. Though this translation was not at\nall to our hero’s liking, he was forced to acquiesce in his fate, glad\nto find himself, on these terms, in possession of his effects, of which\nhe would otherwise have been infallibly rifled.\n\nThis campaign, however, was the most disagreeable period of his whole\nlife; because the manner in which he had entered into the service\nsubjected him to the particular observation and notice of the French\nofficers; so that he was obliged to be very alert in his duty, and\nsummon all his fortitude to maintain the character he had assumed. What\nrendered his situation still more unpalatable, was the activity of both\narmies in the course of this season, during which, over and above\nsundry fatiguing marches and countermarches, he was personally engaged\nin the affair of Halleh, which was very obstinate; where, being in the\nskirts of the detachment, he was actually wounded in the face by the\nsword of an hussar; but this was, luckily for him, the last time he\nfound himself under the necessity of exerting his military prowess, for\na cessation of arms was proclaimed before he was cured of his wound,\nand peace concluded about the end of the campaign.\n\nDuring his sojourn in the French camp, he assumed the character of a\nman of family, who being disgusted at some supercilious treatment he\nhad met with in the German service, and at the same time ambitious of\ncarrying arms under the banners of France, took the opportunity of\nretreating by stealth from his friends, accompanied only by one with\nwhom he could intrust his intention. In this capacity he had managed\nhis matters to such advantage, that many French officers of rank were\nvery well disposed to contribute their interest in his behalf, had his\ninclination verged towards promotion in the army; but he thought proper\nto conceal his real design, under the specious pretext of longing to\nsee the metropolis of France, that centre of pleasure and politeness,\nin which he proposed to spend some time for the improvement of his\naddress and understanding. These were motives too laudable to be\nopposed by his new patrons, some of whom furnished him with letters of\nrecommendation to certain noblemen of the first rank at the court of\nVersailles, for which place he and his companion set out from the banks\nof the Rhine, very well satisfied with the honourable dismission they\nhad obtained from a life of inconvenience, danger, and alarm.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY\n\nHE PREPARES A STRATAGEM BUT FINDS HIMSELF COUNTERMINED—PROCEEDS ON HIS\nJOURNEY, AND IS OVERTAKEN BY A TERRIBLE TEMPEST.\n\nIn the course of this journey, Ferdinand, who was never deficient in\nhis political capacity, held a secret conclave with his own thoughts,\nnot only touching the plan of his own future conduct, but also\nconcerning his associate, of whose fidelity and adherence he began to\nentertain such doubts as discouraged him from the prosecution of that\ndesign in which the Tyrolese had been at first included; for he had\nlately observed him practise the arts of his occupation among the\nFrench officers, with such rapacity and want of caution, as indicated a\ndangerous temerity of temper, as well as a furious rage of acquiring,\nwhich might be some time or other satiated upon his own friends. In\nother words, our adventurer was afraid that his accomplice would profit\nby his knowledge of the road and countries through which they\ntravelled, and, after having made free with his most valuable effects,\nin consequence of the familiarity subsisting between them, leave him\nsome morning without the ceremony of a formal adieu.\n\nAroused by this suspicion, he resolved to anticipate the supposed\nintention of the Tyrolese, by taking his own departure in the same\nabrupt manner; and this scheme he actually put in execution, upon their\narrival in Bar-le-duc, where it was agreed they should spend a day to\nrepose and refresh themselves from the fatigue of hard riding.\nFerdinand, therefore, taking the advantage of his companion’s\nabsence—for the Tyrolese had walked abroad to view the town—found means\nto hire a peasant, who undertook to conduct him through a by-road as\nfar as Chalons, and with his guide he accordingly set out on horseback,\nafter having discharged the bill, left a blank paper sealed up in form\nof a letter, directed to his friend, and secured behind his own saddle\na pair of leathern bags, in which his jewels and cash were usually\ncontained. So eager was our hero to leave the Tyrolese at a\nconsiderable distance behind, that he rode all night at a round pace\nwithout halting, and next morning found himself at a village distant\nthirteen good leagues from any part of the route which he and his\ncompanion had at first resolved to pursue.\n\nHere, thinking himself safely delivered from the cause of all his\napprehension, he determined to lie incognito for a few days, so as that\nhe might run no risk of an accidental meeting upon the road with the\nperson whose company he had forsaken; and accordingly took possession\nof an apartment, in which he went to rest, desiring his guide to wake\nhim when dinner should be ready. Having enjoyed a very comfortable\nrefreshment of sleep, with his bags under his pillow, he was summoned,\naccording to his direction, and ate a very hearty meal, with great\ntranquillity and internal satisfaction. In the afternoon he amused\nhimself with happy presages and ideal prospects of his future fortune,\nand, in the midst of these imaginary banquets, was seized with an\ninclination of realising his bliss, and regaling his eyesight with the\nfruits of that success which had hitherto attended his endeavours. Thus\ninflamed, he opened the repository, and, O reader! what were his\nreflections, when, in lieu of Mademoiselle Melvil’s ear-rings and\nnecklace, the German’s golden chain, divers jewels of considerable\nvalue, the spoils of sundry dupes, and about two hundred ducats in\nready money, he found neither more nor less than a parcel of rusty\nnails, disposed in such a manner as to resemble in weight and bulk the\nmoveables he had lost.\n\nIt is not to be supposed our adventurer made this discovery without\nemotion. If the eternal salvation of mankind could have been purchased\nfor the tenth part of his treasure, he would have left the whole\nspecies in a state of reprobation, rather than redeem them at that\nprice, unless he had seen in the bargain some evident advantage to his\nown concerns. One may, therefore, easily conceive with what milkiness\nof resignation he bore the loss of the whole, and saw himself reduced\nfrom such affluence to the necessity of depending upon about twenty\nducats, and some loose silver, which he carried in his pocket, for his\nexpense upon the road. However bitter this pill might be in swallowing,\nhe so far mastered his mortification, as to digest it with a good\ngrace. His own penetration at once pointed out the canal through which\nthis misfortune had flowed upon him; he forthwith placed the calamity\nto the account of the Tyrolese, and never doubting that he had retired\nwith the booty across the Rhine, into some place to which he knew\nFathom would not follow his footsteps, he formed the melancholy\nresolution of pursuing with all despatch his journey to Paris, that he\nmight, with all convenient expedition, indemnify himself for the\ndiscomfiture he had sustained.\n\nWith regard to his confederate, his conjecture was perfectly right;\nthat adventurer, though infinitely inferior to our hero in point of\ngenius and invention, had manifestly the advantage of him in the\narticles of age and experience; he was no stranger to Fathom’s\nqualifications, the happy exertion of which he had often seen. He knew\nhim to be an economist of the most frugal order, consequently concluded\nhis finances were worthy of examination; and, upon the true principles\nof a sharper, eased him of the encumbrance, taking it for granted,\nthat, in so doing, he only precluded Ferdinand from the power of acting\nthe same tragedy upon him, should ever opportunity concur with his\ninclination. He had therefore concerted his measures with the dexterity\nof an experienced conveyancer, and, snatching the occasion, while our\nhero, travel-tainted, lay sunk in the arms of profound repose, he\nripped up the seams of the leather depository, withdrew the contents,\nintroduced the parcel of nails, which he had made up for the purpose,\nand then repaired the breach with great deliberation.\n\nHad Fathom’s good genius prompted him to examine his effects next\nmorning, the Tyrolese, in all probability, would have maintained his\nacquisition by force of arms; for his personal courage was rather more\ndetermined than that of our adventurer, and he was conscious of his own\nascendency in this particular; but his good fortune prevented such\nexplanation. Immediately after dinner, he availed himself of his\nknowledge, and, betaking himself to a remote part of the town, set out\nin a post-chaise for Luneville, while our hero was meditating his own\nescape.\n\nFathom’s conception was sufficient to comprehend the whole of this\nadventure, as soon as his chagrin would give his sagacity fair play;\nnor would he allow his resolution to sink under the trial; on the\ncontrary, he departed from the village that same afternoon, under the\nauspices of his conductor, and found himself benighted in the midst of\na forest, far from the habitations of men. The darkness of the night,\nthe silence and solitude of the place, the indistinct images of the\ntrees that appeared on every side, “stretching their extravagant arms\nathwart the gloom,” conspired, with the dejection of spirits occasioned\nby his loss, to disturb his fancy, and raise strange phantoms in his\nimagination. Although he was not naturally superstitious, his mind\nbegan to be invaded with an awful horror, that gradually prevailed over\nall the consolations of reason and philosophy; nor was his heart free\nfrom the terrors of assassination. In order to dissipate these\ndisagreeable reveries, he had recourse to the conversation of his\nguide, by whom he was entertained with the history of divers travellers\nwho had been robbed and murdered by ruffians, whose retreat was in the\nrecesses of that very wood.\n\nIn the midst of this communication, which did not at all tend to the\nelevation of our hero’s spirits, the conductor made an excuse for\ndropping behind, while our traveller jogged on in expectation of being\njoined again by him in a few minutes. He was, however, disappointed in\nthat hope; the sound of the other horse’s feet by degrees grew more and\nmore faint, and at last altogether died away. Alarmed at this\ncircumstance, Fathom halted in the middle of the road, and listened\nwith the most fearful attention; but his sense of hearing was saluted\nwith nought but the dismal sighings of the trees, that seemed to\nforetell an approaching storm. Accordingly, the heavens contracted a\nmore dreary aspect, the lightning began to gleam, and the thunder to\nroll, and the tempest, raising its voice to a tremendous roar,\ndescended in a torrent of rain.\n\nIn this emergency, the fortitude of our hero was almost quite overcome.\nSo many concurring circumstances of danger and distress might have\nappalled the most undaunted breast; what impression then must they have\nmade upon the mind of Ferdinand, who was by no means a man to set fear\nat defiance! Indeed, he had well-nigh lost the use of his reflection,\nand was actually invaded to the skin, before he could recollect himself\nso far as to quit the road, and seek for shelter among the thickets\nthat surrounded him. Having rode some furlongs into the forest, he took\nhis station under a tuft of tall trees, that screened him from the\nstorm, and in that situation called a council within himself, to\ndeliberate upon his next excursion. He persuaded himself that his guide\nhad deserted him for the present, in order to give intelligence of a\ntraveller to some gang of robbers with whom he was connected; and that\nhe must of necessity fall a prey to those banditti, unless he should\nhave the good fortune to elude their search, and disentangle himself\nfrom the mazes of the wood.\n\nHarrowed with these apprehensions, he resolved to commit himself to the\nmercy of the hurricane, as of two evils the least, and penetrate\nstraightforwards through some devious opening, until he should be\ndelivered from the forest. For this purpose he turned his horse’s head\nin a line quite contrary to the direction of the high road which he had\nleft, on the supposition that the robbers would pursue that track in\nquest of him, and that they would never dream of his deserting the\nhighway, to traverse an unknown forest, amidst the darkness of such a\nboisterous night. After he had continued in this progress through a\nsuccession of groves, and bogs, and thorns, and brakes, by which not\nonly his clothes, but also his skin suffered in a grievous manner,\nwhile every nerve quivered with eagerness and dismay, he at length\nreached an open plain, and pursuing his course, in full hope of\narriving at some village, where his life would be safe, he descried a\nrush-light at a distance, which he looked upon as the star of his good\nfortune, and riding towards it at full speed, arrived at the door of a\nlone cottage, into which he was admitted by an old woman, who,\nunderstanding he was a bewildered traveller, received him with great\nhospitality.\n\nWhen he learned from his hostess, that there was not another house\nwithin three leagues; that she could accommodate him with a tolerable\nbed, and his horse with lodging and oats, he thanked Heaven for his\ngood fortune, in stumbling upon this homely habitation, and determined\nto pass the night under the protection of the old cottager, who gave\nhim to understand, that her husband, who was a faggot-maker, had gone\nto the next town to dispose of his merchandise; and that, in all\nprobability, he would not return till next morning, on account of the\ntempestuous night. Ferdinand sounded the beldame with a thousand artful\ninterrogations, and she answered with such appearance of truth and\nsimplicity, that he concluded his person was quite secure; and, after\nhaving been regaled with a dish of eggs and bacon, desired she would\nconduct him into the chamber where she proposed he should take his\nrepose. He was accordingly ushered up by a sort of ladder into an\napartment furnished with a standing-bed, and almost half filled with\ntrusses of straw. He seemed extremely well pleased with his lodging,\nwhich in reality exceeded his expectation; and his kind landlady,\ncautioning him against letting the candle approach the combustibles,\ntook her leave, and locked the door on the outside.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\n\nHE FALLS UPON SCYLLA, SEEKING TO AVOID CHARYBDIS.\n\nFathom, whose own principles taught him to be suspicious, and ever upon\nhis guard against the treachery of his fellow-creatures, could have\ndispensed with this instance of her care, in confining her guest to her\nchamber, and began to be seized with strange fancies, when he observed\nthat there was no bolt on the inside of the door, by which he might\nsecure himself from intrusion. In consequence of these suggestions, he\nproposed to take an accurate survey of every object in the apartment,\nand, in the course of his inquiry, had the mortification to find the\ndead body of a man, still warm, who had been lately stabbed, and\nconcealed beneath several bundles of straw.\n\nSuch a discovery could not fail to fill the breast of our hero with\nunspeakable horror; for he concluded that he himself would undergo the\nsame fate before morning, without the interposition of a miracle in his\nfavour. In the first transports of his dread, he ran to the window,\nwith a view to escape by that outlet, and found his flight effectually\nobstructed by divers strong bars of iron. Then his heart began to\npalpitate, his hair to bristle up, and his knees to totter; his\nthoughts teemed with presages of death and destruction; his conscience\nrose up in judgment against him, and he underwent a severe paroxysm of\ndismay and distraction. His spirits were agitated into a state of\nfermentation that produced a species of resolution akin to that which\nis inspired by brandy or other strong liquors, and, by an impulse that\nseemed supernatural, he was immediately hurried into measures for his\nown preservation.\n\nWhat upon a less interesting occasion his imagination durst not\npropose, he now executed without scruple or remorse. He undressed the\ncorpse that lay bleeding among the straw, and, conveying it to the bed\nin his arms, deposited it in the attitude of a person who sleeps at his\nease; then he extinguished the light, took possession of the place from\nwhence the body had been removed, and, holding a pistol ready cocked in\neach hand, waited for the sequel with that determined purpose which is\noften the immediate production of despair. About midnight he heard the\nsound of feet ascending the ladder; the door was softly opened; he saw\nthe shadow of two men stalking towards the bed, a dark lanthorn being\nunshrouded, directed their aim to the supposed sleeper, and he that\nheld it thrust a poniard to his heart; the force of the blow made a\ncompression on the chest, and a sort of groan issued from the windpipe\nof the defunct; the stroke was repeated, without producing a repetition\nof the note, so that the assassins concluded the work was effectually\ndone, and retired for the present with a design to return and rifle the\ndeceased at their leisure.\n\nNever had our hero spent a moment in such agony as he felt during this\noperation; the whole surface of his body was covered with a cold sweat,\nand his nerves were relaxed with an universal palsy. In short, he\nremained in a trance that, in all probability, contributed to his\nsafety; for, had he retained the use of his senses, he might have been\ndiscovered by the transports of his fear. The first use he made of his\nretrieved recollection, was to perceive that the assassins had left the\ndoor open in their retreat; and he would have instantly availed himself\nof this their neglect, by sallying out upon them, at the hazard of his\nlife, had he not been restrained by a conversation he overheard in the\nroom below, importing, that the ruffians were going to set out upon\nanother expedition, in hopes of finding more prey. They accordingly\ndeparted, after having laid strong injunctions upon the old woman to\nkeep the door fast locked during their absence; and Ferdinand took his\nresolution without farther delay. So soon as, by his conjecture, the\nrobbers were at a sufficient distance from the house, he rose from his\nlurking-place, moved softly towards the bed, and, rummaging the pockets\nof the deceased, found a purse well stored with ducats, of which,\ntogether with a silver watch and a diamond ring, he immediately\npossessed himself without scruple; then, descending with great care and\ncircumspection into the lower apartment, stood before the old beldame,\nbefore she had the least intimation of his approach.\n\nAccustomed as she was to the trade of blood, the hoary hag did not\nbehold this apparition without giving signs of infinite terror and\nastonishment, believing it was no other than the spirit of her second\nguest, who had been murdered; she fell upon her knees and began to\nrecommend herself to the protection of the saints, crossing herself\nwith as much devotion as if she had been entitled to the particular\ncare and attention of Heaven. Nor did her anxiety abate, when she was\nundeceived in this her supposition, and understood it was no phantom,\nbut the real substance of the stranger, who, without staying to upbraid\nher with the enormity of her crimes, commanded her, on pain of\nimmediate death, to produce his horse, to which being conducted, he set\nher upon the saddle without delay, and, mounting behind, invested her\nwith the management of the reins, swearing, in a most peremptory tone,\nthat the only chance she had for her life, was in directing him safely\nto the next town; and that, so soon as she should give him the least\ncause to doubt her fidelity in the performance of that task, he would\non the instant act the part of her executioner.\n\nThis declaration had its effect upon the withered Hecate, who, with\nmany supplications for mercy and forgiveness, promised to guide him in\nsafety to a certain village at the distance of two leagues, where he\nmight lodge in security, and be provided with a fresh horse, or other\nconvenience, for pursuing his intended route. On these conditions he\ntold her she might deserve his clemency; and they accordingly took\ntheir departure together, she being placed astride upon the saddle,\nholding the bridle in one hand and a switch in the other; and our\nadventurer sitting on the crupper, superintending her conduct, and\nkeeping the muzzle of a pistol close at her ear. In this equipage they\ntravelled across part of the same wood in which his guide had forsaken\nhim; and it is not to be supposed that he passed his time in the most\nagreeable reverie, while he found himself involved in the labyrinth of\nthose shades, which he considered as the haunts of robbery and\nassassination.\n\nCommon fear was a comfortable sensation to what he felt in this\nexcursion. The first steps he had taken for his preservation were the\neffects of mere instinct, while his faculties were extinguished or\nsuppressed by despair; but now, as his reflection began to recur, he\nwas haunted by the most intolerable apprehensions. Every whisper of the\nwind through the thickets was swelled into the hoarse menaces of\nmurder, the shaking of the boughs was construed into the brandishing of\nponiards, and every shadow of a tree became the apparition of a ruffian\neager for blood. In short, at each of these occurrences he felt what\nwas infinitely more tormenting than the stab of a real dagger; and at\nevery fresh fillip of his fear, he acted as a remembrancer to his\nconductress, in a new volley of imprecations, importing, that her life\nwas absolutely connected with his opinion of his own safety.\n\nHuman nature could not longer subsist under such complicated terror. At\nlast he found himself clear of the forest, and was blessed with the\ndistant view of an inhabited place. He then began to exercise his\nthoughts upon a new subject. He debated with himself, whether he should\nmake a parade of his intrepidity and public spirit, by disclosing his\nachievement, and surrendering his guide to the penalty of the law; or\nleave the old hag and her accomplices to the remorse of their own\nconsciences, and proceed quietly on his journey to Paris in undisturbed\npossession of the prize he had already obtained. This last step he\ndetermined to take, upon recollecting, that, in the course of his\ninformation, the story of the murdered stranger would infallibly\nattract the attention of justice, and, in that case, the effects he had\nborrowed from the defunct must be refunded for the benefit of those who\nhad a right to the succession. This was an argument which our\nadventurer could not resist; he foresaw that he should be stripped of\nhis acquisition, which he looked upon as the fair fruits of his valour\nand sagacity; and, moreover, be detained as an evidence against the\nrobbers, to the manifest detriment of his affairs. Perhaps too he had\nmotives of conscience, that dissuaded him from bearing witness against\na set of people whose principles did not much differ from his own.\n\nInfluenced by such considerations, he yielded to the first importunity\nof the beldame, whom he dismissed at a very small distance from the\nvillage, after he had earnestly exhorted her to quit such an atrocious\ncourse of life, and atone for her past crimes, by sacrificing her\nassociates to the demands of justice. She did not fail to vow a perfect\nreformation, and to prostrate herself before him for the favour she had\nfound; then she betook herself to her habitation, with full purpose of\nadvising her fellow-murderers to repair with all despatch to the\nvillage, and impeach our hero, who, wisely distrusting her professions,\nstayed no longer in the place than to hire a guide for the next stage,\nwhich brought him to the city of Chalons-sur-Marne.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\n\nHE ARRIVES AT PARIS, AND IS PLEASED WITH HIS RECEPTION.\n\nHe was not so smitten with the delightful situation of this ancient\ntown, but that he abandoned it as soon as he could procure a\npost-chaise, in which he arrived at Paris, without having been exposed\nto any other troublesome adventure upon the road. He took lodgings at a\ncertain hotel in the Fauxbourg de St. Germain, which is the general\nrendezvous of all the strangers that resort to this capital; and now\nsincerely congratulated himself upon his happy escape from his\nHungarian connexions, and from the snares of the banditti, as well as\nupon the spoils of the dead body, and his arrival at Paris, from whence\nthere was such a short conveyance to England, whither he was attracted,\nby far other motives than that of filial veneration for his native\nsoil.\n\nHe suppressed all his letters of recommendation, which he justly\nconcluded would subject him to a tedious course of attendance upon the\ngreat, and lay him under the necessity of soliciting preferment in the\narmy, than which nothing was farther from his inclination; and resolved\nto make his appearance in the character of a private gentleman, which\nwould supply him with opportunities of examining the different scenes\nof life in such a gay metropolis, so as that he should be able to\nchoose that sphere in which he could move the most effectually to his\nown advantage. He accordingly hired an occasional domestic, and under\nthe denomination of Count Fathom, which he had retained since his\nelopement from Renaldo, repaired to dinner at an ordinary, to which he\nwas directed as a reputable place, frequented by fashionable strangers\nof all nations.\n\nHe found this piece of information perfectly just; for he no sooner\nentered the apartment, than his ears were saluted with a strange\nconfusion of sounds, among which he at once distinguished the High and\nLow Dutch, barbarous French, Italian, and English languages. He was\nrejoiced at this occasion of displaying his own qualifications, took\nhis place at one of the three long tables, betwixt a Westphalian count\nand a Bolognian marquis, insinuated himself into the conversation with\nhis usual address, and in less than half an hour, found means to accost\na native of each different country in his own mother-tongue.\n\nSuch extensive knowledge did not pass unobserved. A French abbe, in a\nprovincial dialect, complimented him upon his retaining that purity in\npronunciation, which is not to be found in the speech of a Parisian.\nThe Bolognian, mistaking him for a Tuscan, “Sir,” said he, “I presume\nyou are from Florence. I hope the illustrious house of Lorrain leaves\nyou gentlemen of that famous city no room to regret the loss of your\nown princes.” The castle of Versailles becoming the subject of\nconversation, Monsieur le Compte appealed to him, as to a native\nGerman, whether it was not inferior in point of magnificence to the\nchateau of Grubenhagen. The Dutch officer, addressing himself to\nFathom, drank to the prosperity of Faderland, and asked if he had not\nonce served in garrison at Shenkenschans; and an English knight swore,\nwith great assurance, that he had frequently rambled with him at\nmidnight among the hundreds of Drury.\n\nTo each person he replied in a polite, though mysterious manner, which\ndid not fail to enhance their opinion of his good breeding and\nimportance; and, long before the dessert appeared, he was by all the\ncompany supposed to be a personage of great consequence, who for some\nsubstantial reasons, found it convenient to keep himself incognito.\nThis being the case, it is not to be doubted that particular civilities\nwere poured upon him from all quarters. He perceived their sentiments,\nand encouraged them, by behaving with that sort of complaisance which\nseems to be the result of engaging condescension in a character of\nsuperior dignity and station. His affability was general but his chief\nattention limited to those gentlemen already mentioned, who chanced to\nsit nearest him at table; and he no sooner gave them to understand that\nhe was an utter stranger in Paris, than they unanimously begged to have\nthe honour of making him acquainted with the different curiosities\npeculiar to that metropolis.\n\nHe accepted of their hospitality, accompanied them to a coffee-house in\nthe afternoon, from whence they repaired to the opera, and afterwards\nadjourned to a noted hotel, in order to spend the remaining part of the\nevening. It was here that our hero secured himself effectually in the\nfooting he had gained in their good graces. He in a moment saw through\nall the characters of the party, and adapted himself to the humour of\neach individual, without descending from that elevation of behaviour\nwhich he perceived would operate among them in his behalf. With the\nItalian he discoursed on music, in the style of a connoisseur; and\nindeed had a better claim to that title than the generality of those\nupon whom it is usually conferred; for he understood the art in theory\nas well as in practice, and would have made no contemptible figure\namong the best performers of the age.\n\nHe harangued upon taste and genius to the abbe, who was a wit and\ncritic, ex officio, or rather ex vestitu for a young pert Frenchman,\nthe very moment he puts on the petit collet, or little band, looks upon\nhimself as an inspired son of Apollo; and every one of the fraternity\nthinks it incumbent upon him to assert the divinity of his mission. In\na word, the abbes are a set of people that bear a strong analogy to the\ntemplars in London. Fools of each fabric, sharpers of all sorts, and\ndunces of every degree, profess themselves of both orders. The templar\nis, generally speaking, a prig, so is the abbe: both are distinguished\nby an air of petulance and self-conceit, which holds a middle rank\nbetwixt the insolence of a first-rate buck and the learned pride of a\nsupercilious pedant. The abbe is supposed to be a younger brother in\nquest of preferment in the church—the Temple is considered as a\nreceptacle or seminary for younger sons intended for the bar; but a\ngreat number of each profession turn aside into other paths of life,\nlong before they reach these proposed goals. An abbe is often\nmetamorphosed into a foot soldier; a templar sometimes sinks into an\nattorney’s clerk. The galleys of France abound with abbes; and many\ntemplars may be found in our American plantations; not to mention those\nwho have made a public exit nearer home. Yet I would not have it\nthought that my description includes every individual of those\nsocieties. Some of the greatest scholars, politicians, and wits, that\never Europe produced, have worn the habit of an abbe; and many of our\nmost noble families in England derive their honours from those who have\nstudied law in the Temple. The worthy sons of every community shall\nalways be sacred from my censure and ridicule; and, while I laugh at\nthe folly of particular members, I can still honour and revere the\ninstitution.\n\nBut let us return from this comparison, which some readers may think\nimpertinent and unseasonable, and observe, that the Westphalian count,\nDutch officer, and English knight, were not excepted from the\nparticular regard and attention of our adventurer. He pledged the\nGerman in every bumper; flattered the Hollander with compliments upon\nthe industry, wealth, and policy of the Seven United Provinces; but he\nreserved his chief battery for his own countryman, on the supposition\nthat he was, in all respects, the best adapted for the purposes of a\nneedy gamester. Him, therefore, he cultivated with extraordinary care\nand singular observance; for he soon perceived him to be a humourist,\nand, from that circumstance, derived an happy presage of his own\nsuccess. The baronet’s disposition seemed to be cast in the true\nEnglish mould. He was sour, silent, and contemptuous; his very looks\nindicated a consciousness of superior wealth; and he never opened his\nmouth, except to make some dry, sarcastic, national reflection. Nor was\nhis behaviour free from that air of suspicion which a man puts on when\nhe believes himself in a crowd of pick-pockets, whom his caution and\nvigilance set at defiance. In a word, though his tongue was silent on\nthe subject, his whole demeanour was continually saying, “You are all a\npack of poor lousy rascals, who have a design upon my purse. ’Tis true,\nI could buy your whole generation, but I won’t be bubbled, d’ye see; I\nam aware of your flattery, and upon my guard against all your knavish\npranks; and I come into your company for my own amusement only.”\n\nFathom having reconnoitred this peculiarity of temper, instead of\ntreating him with that assiduous complaisance, which he received from\nthe other gentlemen of the party, kept aloof from him in the\nconversation, with a remarkable shyness of distant civility, and seldom\ntook notice of what he said, except with a view to contradict him, or\nretort some of his satirical observations. This he conceived to be the\nbest method of acquiring his good opinion; because the Englishman would\nnaturally conclude he was a person who could have no sinister views\nupon his fortune, else he would have chosen quite a different manner of\ndeportment. Accordingly, the knight seemed to bite at the hook. He\nlistened to Ferdinand with uncommon regard; he was even heard to\ncommend his remarks, and at length drank to their better acquaintance.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\n\nACQUITS HIMSELF WITH ADDRESS IN A NOCTURNAL RIOT.\n\nThe Italian and the abbe were the first who began to grow whimsical\nunder the influence of the burgundy; and, in the heat of their\nelevation, proposed that the company should amuse themselves during the\nremaining part of the night, at the house of an obliging dame, who\nmaintained a troop of fair nymphs for the accommodation of the other\nsex. The proposal was approved by all, except the Hollander, whose\neconomy the wine had not as yet invaded; and, while he retreated\nsoberly to his own lodgings, the rest of the society adjourned in two\ncoaches to the temple of love, where they were received by the\nvenerable priestess, a personage turned of seventy, who seemed to\nexercise the functions of her calling, in despite of the most cruel\nravages of time; for age had bent her into the form of a Turkish bow.\nHer head was agitated by the palsy, like the leaf of the poplar tree;\nher hair fell down in scanty parcels, as white as the driven snow; her\nface was not simply wrinkled, but ploughed into innumerable furrows;\nher jaws could not boast of one remaining tooth; one eye distilled a\nlarge quantity of rheum, by virtue of the fiery edge that surrounded\nit; the other was altogether extinguished, and she had lost her nose in\nthe course of her ministration. The Delphic sibyl was but a type of\nthis hoary matron, who, by her figure, might have been mistaken for the\nconsort of Chaos, or mother of Time. Yet there was something\nmeritorious in her appearance, as it denoted her an indefatigable\nminister to the pleasure of mankind, and as it formed an agreeable\ncontrast with the beauty and youth of the fair damsels that wantoned in\nher train. It resembled those discords in music, which, properly\ndisposed, contribute to the harmony of the whole piece; or those\nhorrible giants, who, in the world of romance, used to guard the gates\nof the castle in which the enchanted damsel was confined.\n\nThis Urganda seemed to be aware of her own importance, and perfectly\nwell acquainted with the human appetite; for she compelled the whole\ncompany to undergo her embrace. Then a lacquey, in magnificent livery,\nushered them into a superb apartment, where they waited some minutes,\nwithout being favoured with the appearance of the ladies, to the\nmanifest dissatisfaction of the abbe, who, sending for the gouvernante,\nreprimanded her severely for her want of politesse. The old lady, who\nwas by no means a pattern of patience and submission, retorted his\nreproaches with great emphasis and vivacity. Her eloquence flowed\naltogether in the Covent Garden strain; and I question whether the\ncelebrated Mother Douglas herself could have made such a figure in an\nextemporaneous altercation.\n\nAfter having bestowed upon the abbe the epithets of saucy insignificant\npimp, she put him in mind of the good offices which he had received at\nher hands; how she had supplied him with bed, board, and bedfellow, in\nhis greatest necessity; sent him abroad with money in his pockets—and,\nin a word, cherished him in her bosom, when his own mother had\nabandoned him to distress. She then reviled him for presuming to\naffront her before strangers, and gave the company to understand, that\nthe young ladies would wait upon them as soon as they could be\nconfessed and receive absolution from a worthy cordelier, who was now\nemployed in performing that charitable office. The gentlemen were\nsatisfied with this remonstrance, which argued the old lady’s pious\nconcern for the souls that were under her care, and our adventurer\nproposed an accommodation betwixt her and the abbe, who was prevailed\nupon to ask her pardon, and received her blessing upon his knees.\n\nThis affair had not been long adjusted, when five damsels were\nintroduced in a very gay dishabille, and our hero was complimented with\nthe privilege of choosing his Amanda from the whole bevy. When he was\nprovided, the others began to pair themselves, and, unhappily, the\nGerman count chanced to pitch upon the same nymph who had captivated\nthe desires of the British knight. A dispute immediately ensued; for\nthe Englishman made his addresses to the lady, without paying the least\nregard to the priority of the other’s claim; and she, being pleased\nwith his attachment, did not scruple to renounce his rival, who swore\nby the thunder, lightning, and sacrament, that he would not quit his\npretensions for any prince in Christendom, much less for a little\nEnglish cavalier, whom he had already honoured too much in\ncondescending to be his companion.\n\nThe knight, provoked at this stately declaration, which was the\nimmediate effect of anger and ebriety, eyed his antagonist with a most\ncontemptuous aspect, and advised him to avoid such comparisons for the\nfuture. “We all know,” said he, “the importance of a German count; I\nsuppose your revenue amounts to three hundred rix-dollars; and you have\na chateau that looks like the ruins of an English gaol. I will bind\nmyself to lend you a thousand pounds upon a mortgage of your estate,\n(and a bad bargain I am sure I shall have,) if I do not, in less than\ntwo months, find a yeoman of Kent, who spends more in strong ale than\nthe sum-total of your yearly income; and, were the truth known, I\nbelieve that lace upon your coat is no better than tinsel, and those\nfringed ruffles, with fine Holland sleeves, tacked to a shirt of brown\ncanvas, so that, were you to undress yourself before the lady, you\nwould only expose your own poverty and pride.”\n\nThe count was so much enraged at these sarcastic observations, that his\nfaculty of speech was overwhelmed by his resentment; though, in order\nto acquit himself of the Englishman’s imputation, he forthwith pulled\noff his clothes with such fury, that his brocade waistcoat was tore\nfrom top to bottom. The knight, mistaking his meaning, considered this\ndemeanour as a fair challenge, to try which was the better man in the\nexercise of boxing; and, on that supposition, began to strip in his\nturn, when he was undeceived by Fathom, who put the right\ninterpretation upon the count’s behaviour, and begged that the affair\nmight be compromised. By this time the Westphalian recovered the use of\nhis tongue, and with many threats and imprecations, desired they would\ntake notice how falsely he had been aspersed, and do him justice in\nespousing his claim to the damsel in question.\n\nBefore the company had time or inclination to interest themselves in\nthe quarrel, his opponent observed that no person who was not a mere\nGerman, would ever dream of forcing the inclinations of a pretty girl,\nwhom the accidents of fortune had subjected to his power; that such\ncompulsion was equivalent to the most cruel rape that could be\ncommitted; and that the lady’s aversion was not at all surprising; for,\nto speak his own sentiments, were he a woman of pleasure, he would as\nsoon grant favours to a Westphalian hog, as to the person of his\nantagonist. The German, enraged at this comparison, was quite abandoned\nby his patience and discretion. He called the knight an English clown,\nand, swearing he was the most untoward beast of a whole nation of\nmules, snatched up one of the candlesticks, which he launched at him\nwith such force and violence, that it sung through the air, and,\nwinging its flight into the ante-chamber, encountered the skull of his\nown valet, who with immediate prostration received the message of his\nmaster.\n\nThe knight, that he might not be behindhand with the Westphalian in\npoint of courtesy, returned the compliment with the remaining\nchandelier, which also missed its mark, and, smiting a large mirror\nthat was fixed behind them, emitted such a crash as one might expect to\nhear if a mine were sprung beneath a manufacture of glass. Both lights\nbeing thus extinguished, a furious combat ensued in the dark; the\nItalian scampered off with infinite agility, and, as he went\ndownstairs, desired that nobody would interpose, because it was an\naffair of honour, which could not be made up. The ladies consulted\ntheir safety in flight; Count Fathom slyly retired to one corner of the\nroom; while the abbe, having upon him the terrors of the commissaire,\nendeavoured to appease and part the combatants, and, in the attempt,\nsustained a random blow upon his nose, which sent him howling into the\nother chamber, where, finding his band besmeared with his own blood, he\nbegan to caper about the apartment, in a transport of rage and\nvexation.\n\nMeanwhile, the old gentlewoman being alarmed with the noise of the\nbattle, and apprehensive that it would end in murder, to the danger and\ndiscredit of herself and family, immediately mustered up her myrmidons,\nof whom she always retained a formidable band, and, putting herself at\ntheir head, lighted them to the scene of uproar. Ferdinand, who had\nhitherto observed a strict neutrality, no sooner perceived them\napproach, than he leaped in between the disputants, that he might be\nfound acting in the character of a peacemaker; and, indeed, by this\ntime, victory had declared for the baronet, who had treated his\nantagonist with a cross-buttock, which laid him almost breathless on\nthe floor. The victor was prevailed upon, by the entreaties of Fathom,\nto quit the field of battle, and adjourn into another room, where, in\nless than half an hour, he received a billet from the count, defying\nhim to single combat on the frontiers of Flanders, at an appointed time\nand place. The challenge was immediately accepted by the knight, who,\nbeing flushed with conquest, treated his adversary with great contempt.\n\nBut, next day, when the fumes of the burgundy were quite exhaled, and\nthe adventure recurred to his remembrance and sober reflection, he\nwaited upon our adventurer at his lodgings, and solicited his advice in\nsuch a manner, as gave him to understand that he looked upon what had\nhappened as a drunken brawl, which ought to have no serious\nconsequences. Fathom foreseeing that the affair might be managed for\nhis own interest, professed himself of the baronet’s opinion; and,\nwithout hesitation, undertook the office of a mediator, assuring his\nprincipal, that his honour should suffer no stain in the course of his\nnegotiation.\n\nHaving received the Englishman’s acknowledgments for this instance of\nfriendship, he forthwith set out for the place of the German’s\nhabitation, and understanding he was still asleep, insisted upon his\nbeing immediately waked, and told, that a gentleman from the chevalier\ndesired to see him, upon business of importance which could not be\ndelayed. Accordingly, his valet-de-chambre, pressed by Fathom’s\nimportunities and remonstrances, ventured to go in and shake the count\nby the shoulder; when this furious Teutonian, still agitated by the\nfever of the preceding night, leaped out of bed in a frenzy, and\nseizing his sword that lay upon a table, would have severely punished\nthe presumption of his servant, had not he been restrained by the\nentrance of Ferdinand, who, with a peremptory countenance, gave him to\nunderstand that the valet had acted at his immediate instigation; and\nthat he was come, as the Englishman’s friend, to concert with him\nproper measures for keeping the appointment they had made at their last\nmeeting.\n\nThis message effectually calmed the German, who was not a little\nmortified to find himself so disagreeably disturbed. He could not help\ncursing the impatience of his antagonist, and even hinting that he\nwould have acted more like a gentleman and good Christian, in\nexpressing a desire of seeing the affair accommodated, as he knew\nhimself to be the aggressor, consequently the first offender against\nthe laws of politeness and good-fellowship. Fathom, finding him in a\nfit temper of mind, took the opportunity of assenting to the\nreasonableness of his observation. He ventured to condemn the\nimpetuosity of the baronet, who, he perceived, was extremely nice and\nscrupulous in the punctilios of honour; and said it was a pity that two\ngentlemen should forfeit each other’s friendship, much less expose\ntheir lives, for such a frivolous cause. “My dear count,” cried the\nWestphalian, “I am charmed to find your sentiments so conformable to my\nown. In an honourable cause, I despise all danger; my courage, thank\nHeaven! has been manifested in many public engagements as well as in\nprivate rencounters; but, to break with my friend, whose eminent\nvirtues I admire, and even to seek his life, on such a scandalous\noccasion, for a little insignificant w—-e, who, I suppose, took the\nadvantage of our intoxication, to foment the quarrel: by Heaven! my\nconscience cannot digest it.”\n\nHaving expressed himself to this purpose, he waited impatiently for the\nreply of Ferdinand, who, after a pause of deliberation, offered his\nservices in the way of mediation; though, he observed, it was a matter\nof great delicacy, and the event altogether uncertain. “Nevertheless,”\nadded our adventurer, “I will strive to appease the knight, who, I\nhope, will be induced by my remonstrances to forget the unlucky\naccident, which hath so disagreeably interrupted your mutual\nfriendship.” The German thanked him for this proof of his regard, which\nyielded him more satisfaction on account of the chevalier than of\nhimself. “For, by the tombs of my fathers,” cried he, “I have so little\nconcern for my personal safety, that, if my honour were interested, I\ndurst oppose myself singly to the whole ban of the empire; and I am now\nready, if the chevalier requires it, to give him the rendezvous in the\nforest of Senlis, either on horseback or on foot, where this contest\nmay be terminated with the life of one or both of us.”\n\nCount Fathom, with a view to chastise the Westphalian for this\nrhodomontade, told him, with a mortifying air of indifference, that if\nthey were both bent upon taking the field, he would save himself the\ntrouble of interposing farther in the affair; and desired to know the\nhour at which it would suit him to take the air with the baronet. The\nother, not a little embarrassed by this question, said, with a\nfaltering tongue, he should be proud to obey the chevalier’s orders;\nbut, at the same time, owned he should be much better pleased if our\nhero would execute the pacific proposal he had made. Fathom accordingly\npromised to exert himself for that purpose, and returned to the knight,\nwith whom he assumed the merit of having tranquillised the rage of an\nincensed barbarian, who was now disposed to a reconciliation upon equal\nterms. The baronet overwhelmed him with caresses and compliments upon\nhis friendship and address; the parties met that same forenoon, as if\nby accident, in Fathom’s apartment, where they embraced each other\ncordially, exchanged apologies, and renewed their former\ncorrespondence.\n\nOur adventurer thought he had good reason to congratulate himself upon\nthe part he had acted in this pacification. He was treated by both with\nsignal marks of particular affection and esteem. The count pressed him\nto accept, as a token of his attachment, a sword of very curious\nworkmanship, which he had received in a present from a certain prince\nof the empire. The knight forced upon his finger a very splendid\ndiamond ring, as a testimony of his gratitude and esteem. But there was\nstill another person to be appeased, before the peace of the whole\ncompany could be established. This was no other than the abbe, from\nwhom each of the reconciled friends received at dinner a billet couched\nin these words:—\n\n“I have the honour to lament the infinite chagrin and mortification\nthat compels me to address myself in this manner to a person of your\nrank and eminence, whom I should do myself the pleasure of waiting upon\nin person, were I not prevented by the misfortune of my nose, which was\nlast night most cruelly disarranged, by a violent contusion I had the\nhonour to receive, in attempting to compose that unhappy fracas, at the\nhouse of Madame la Maquerelle; and what puts the finishing stroke to my\nmishap, is my being rendered incapable of keeping three or four\nassignations with ladies of fashion, by whom I have the honour to be\nparticularly esteemed. The disfiguration of my nose, the pain I have\nundergone, with the discomposure of brain which it produced, I could\nbear as a philosopher; but the disappointment of the ladies, my glory\nwill not permit me to overlook. And as you know the injury was\nsustained in your service, I have the pleasure to hope you will not\nrefuse to grant such reparation as will be acceptable to a gentleman,\nwho has the honour to be with inviolable attachment,—\n\nSir, your most devoted slave,\nPEPIN CLOTHAIRE CHARLE HENRI LOOUIS BARNABE DE FUMIER.”\n\nThis epistle was so equivocal, that the persons to whom it was\naddressed did not know whether or not they ought to interpret the\ncontents into a challenge; when our hero observed, that the ambiguity\nof his expressions plainly proved there was a door left open for\naccommodation; and proposed that they should forthwith visit the writer\nat his own apartment. They accordingly followed his advice, and found\nthe abbe in his morning gown and slippers, with three huge nightcaps on\nhis head, and a crape hat-band tied over the middle of his face, by way\nof bandage to his nose. He received his visitors with the most\nridiculous solemnity, being still a stranger to the purport of their\nerrand; but soon as the Westphalian declared they were come in\nconsequence of his billet, in order to ask pardon for the undesigned\noffence they had given, his features retrieved their natural vivacity,\nand he professed himself perfectly satisfied with their polite\nacknowledgment. Then they condoled him upon the evil plight of his\nnose, and seeing some marks upon his shirt, asked with seeming concern,\nif he had lost any blood in the fray? To this interrogation he replied,\nthat he had still a sufficient quantity left for the occasions of his\nfriends; and that he should deem it his greatest glory to expend the\nlast drop of it in their service.\n\nMatters being thus amicably adjusted, they prevailed upon him to unease\nhis nose, which retained no signs of the outrage he had suffered; and\nthe amusements of the day were concerted. It was in consequence of this\nplan, that, after the comedy, they were entertained at the count’s\nlodgings, where quadrille was proposed by the abbe, as the most\ninnocent pastime, and the proposal was immediately embraced by all\npresent, and by none with more alacrity than by our adventurer, who,\nwithout putting forth a moiety of his skill, went home with twenty\nlouis clear gain. Though, far from believing himself greatly superior\nto the rest of the party, in the artifices of play, he justly suspected\nthat they had concealed their skill, with a view of stripping him on\nsome other occasion; for he could not suppose that persons of their\nfigure and character should be, in reality, such novices as they\naffected to appear.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n\nHE OVERLOOKS THE ADVANCES OF HIS FRIENDS, AND SMARTS SEVERELY FOR HIS\nNEGLECT.\n\nSteeled with this cautious maxim, he guarded himself from their united\nendeavours, in sundry subsequent attacks, by which his first conjecture\nwas confirmed, and still came off conqueror, by virtue of his\nunparalleled finesse and discretion; till at length they seemed to\ndespair of making him their prey, and the count began to drop some\nhints, importing a desire of seeing him more closely united to the\nviews and interest of their triumvirate. But Ferdinand, who was\naltogether selfish, and quite solitary in his prospects, discouraged\nall those advances, being resolved to trade upon his own bottom only,\nand to avoid all such connexions with any person or society whatever;\nmuch more, with a set of raw adventurers whose talents he despised.\nWith these sentiments, he still maintained the dignity and reserve of\nhis first appearance among them, and rather enhanced than diminished\nthat idea of importance which he had inspired at the beginning;\nbecause, besides his other qualifications, they gave him credit for the\naddress with which he kept himself superior to their united designs.\n\nWhile he thus enjoyed his pre-eminence, together with the fruits of his\nsuccess at play, which he managed so discreetly as never to incur the\nreputation of an adventurer, he one day chanced to be at the ordinary,\nwhen the company was surprised by the entrance of such a figure as had\nnever appeared before in that place. This was no other than a person\nhabited in the exact uniform of an English jockey. His leathern cap,\ncut bob, fustian frock, flannel waistcoat, buff breeches, hunting-boots\nand whip, were sufficient of themselves to furnish out a phenomenon for\nthe admiration of all Paris. But these peculiarities were rendered\nstill more conspicuous by the behaviour of the man who owned them. When\nhe crossed the threshold of the outward door, he produced such a sound\nfrom the smack of his whip, as equalled the explosion of an ordinary\ncohorn; and then broke forth into the halloo of a foxhunter, which he\nuttered with all its variations, in a strain of vociferation that\nseemed to astonish and confound the whole assembly, to whom he\nintroduced himself and his spaniel, by exclaiming, in a tone something\nless melodious than the cry of mackerel or live cod, “By your leave,\ngentlevolks, I hope there’s no offence, in an honest plain Englishman’s\ncoming with money in his pocket, to taste a bit of your Vrench frigasee\nand ragooze.”\n\nThis declaration was made in such a wild, fantastical manner, that the\ngreatest part of the company mistook him for some savage monster or\nmaniac, and consulted their safety by starting up from table, and\ndrawing their swords. The Englishman, seeing such a martial apparatus\nproduced against him, recoiled two or three steps, saying, “Waunds! a\nbelieve the people are all bewitched. What, do they take me for a beast\nof prey? is there nobody here that knows Sir Stentor Stile, or can\nspeak to me in my own lingo?” He had no sooner pronounced these words,\nthan the baronet, with marks of infinite surprise, ran towards him,\ncrying, “Good Heaven! Sir Stentor, who expected to meet with you in\nParis?” Upon which, the other eyeing him very earnestly, “Odds\nheartlikins!” cried he, “my neighbour, Sir Giles Squirrel, as I am a\nliving soul!” With these words he flew upon him like a tiger, kissed\nhim from ear to ear, demolished his periwig, and disordered the whole\neconomy of his dress, to the no small entertainment of the company.\n\nHaving well-nigh stifled his countryman with embraces, and besmeared\nhimself with pulville from head to foot, he proceeded in this manner,\n“Mercy upon thee, knight, thou art so transmographied, and bedaubed,\nand bedizened, that thou mought rob thy own mother without fear of\ninformation. Look ye here now, I will be trussed, if the very bitch\nthat was brought up in thy own bosom knows thee again. Hey, Sweetlips,\nhere hussy, d—n the tuoad, dos’t n’t know thy old measter? Ey, ey, thou\nmay’st smell till Christmas, I’ll be bound to be hanged, knight, if the\ncreature’s nose an’t foundered by the d——d stinking perfumes you have\ngot among you.”\n\nThese compliments being passed, the two knights sat down by one\nanother, and Sir Stentor being asked by his neighbour, upon what errand\nhe had crossed the sea, gave him to understand, that he had come to\nFrance, in consequence of a wager with Squire Snaffle, who had laid a\nthousand pounds, that he, Sir Stentor, would not travel to Paris by\nhimself, and for a whole month appear every day at a certain hour in\nthe public walks, without wearing any other dress than that in which he\nsaw him. “The fellor has got no more stuff in his pate,” continued this\npolite stranger, “than a jackass, to think I could not find my way\nhither thof I could not jabber your French lingo. Ecod! the people of\nthis country are sharp enough to find out your meaning, when you want\nto spend anything among them; and, as for the matter of dress,\nbodikins! for a thousand pound, I would engage to live in the midst of\nthem, and show myself without any clothes at all. Odds heart! a\ntrue-born Englishman needs not be ashamed to show his face, nor his\nbackside neither, with the best Frenchman that ever trod the ground.\nThof we Englishmen don’t beplaister our doublets with gold and silver,\nI believe as how we have our pockets better lined than most of our\nneighbours; and for all my bit of a fustian frock, that cost me in all\nbut forty shillings, I believe, between you and me, knight, I have more\ndust in my fob, than all those powdered sparks put together. But the\nworst of the matter is this; here is no solid belly-timber in this\ncountry. One can’t have a slice of delicate sirloin, or nice buttock of\nbeef, for love nor money. A pize upon them! I could get no eatables\nupon the ruoad, but what they called bully, which looks like the flesh\nof Pharaoh’s lean kine stewed into rags and tatters; and then their\npeajohn, peajohn, rabbet them! One would think every old woman of this\nkingdom hatched pigeons from her own body.”\n\nIt is not to be supposed that such an original sat unobserved. The\nFrench and other foreigners, who had never been in England, were struck\ndumb with amazement at the knight’s appearance and deportment; while\nthe English guests were overwhelmed with shame and confusion, and kept\na most wary silence, for fear of being recognised by their countryman.\nAs for our adventurer, he was inwardly transported with joy at sight of\nthis curiosity. He considered him as a genuine, rich country booby, of\nthe right English growth, fresh as imported; and his heart throbbed\nwith rapture, when he heard Sir Stentor value himself upon the lining\nof his pockets. He foresaw, indeed, that the other knight would\nendeavour to reserve him for his own game; but he was too conscious of\nhis own accomplishments to think he should find great difficulty in\nsuperseding the influence of Sir Giles.\n\nMeanwhile, the new-comer was by his friend helped to some ragout, which\npleased his palate so well, that he declared he should now make a\nhearty meal, for the first time since he had crossed the water; and,\nwhile his good-humour prevailed, he drank to every individual around\nthe table. Ferdinand seized this opportunity of insinuating himself\ninto his favour, by saying in English, he was glad to find there was\nanything in France that was agreeable to Sir Stentor. To this\ncompliment the knight replied with an air of surprise: “Waunds! I find\nhere’s another countryman of mine in this here company. Sir, I am proud\nto see you with all my heart.” So speaking, he thrust out his right\nhand across the table, and shook our hero by the fist, with such\nviolence of civility, as proved very grievous to a French marquis, who,\nin helping himself to soup, was jostled in such a manner, as to\noverturn the dividing-spoon in his own bosom. The Englishman, seeing\nthe mischief he had produced, cried, “No offence, I hope,” in a tone of\nvociferation, which the marquis in all probability misconstrued; for he\nbegan to model his features into a very sublime and peremptory look,\nwhen Fathom interpreted the apology, and at the same time informed Sir\nStentor, that although he himself had not the honour of being an\nEnglishman, he had always entertained a most particular veneration for\nthe country, and learned the language in consequence of that esteem.\n\n“Blood!” answered the knight, “I think myself the more obliged to you\nfor your kind opinion, than if you was my countryman in good earnest.\nFor there be abundance of we English—no offence, Sir Giles—that seem to\nbe ashamed of their own nation, and leave their homes to come and spend\ntheir fortunes abroad, among a parcel of—you understand me, sir—a word\nto the wise, as the saying is.”—Here he was interrupted by an article\nof the second course, that seemed to give him great disturbance. This\nwas a roasted leveret, very strong of the fumet, which happened to be\nplaced directly under his nose. His sense of smelling was no sooner\nencountered by the effluvia of this delicious fare, than he started up\nfrom table, exclaiming, “Odd’s my liver! here’s a piece of carrion,\nthat I would not offer to e’er a hound in my kennel; ’tis enough to\nmake any Christian vomit both gut and gall;” and indeed by the wry\nfaces he made while he ran to the door, his stomach seemed ready to\njustify this last assertion.\n\nThe abbe, who concluded, from these symptoms of disgust, that the\nleveret was not sufficiently stale, began to exhibit marks of\ndiscontent, and desired that it might be brought to the other end of\nthe table for his examination. He accordingly hung over it with the\nmost greedy appetite, feasting his nostrils with the steams of animal\nputrefaction; and at length declared that the morceau was passable,\nthough he owned it would have been highly perfect, had it been kept\nanother week. Nevertheless, mouths were not wanting to discuss it,\ninsipid as it was; for in three minutes there was not a vestige to be\nseen of that which had offended the organs of Sir Stentor, who now\nresumed his place, and did justice to the dessert. But what he seemed\nto relish better than any other part of the entertainment, was the\nconversation of our adventurer, whom, after dinner, he begged to have\nthe honour of treating with a dish of coffee, to the seeming\nmortification of his brother knight, over which Fathom exulted in his\nown heart.\n\nIn short, our hero, by his affability and engaging deportment,\nimmediately gained possession of Sir Stentor’s good graces, insomuch,\nthat he desired to crack a bottle with him in the evening, and they\nrepaired to an auberge, whither his fellow-knight accompanied him, not\nwithout manifest signs of reluctance. There the stranger gave a loose\nto jollity; though at first he d—-ed the burgundy as a poor thin\nliquor, that ran through him in a twinkling, and, instead of warming,\ncooled his heart and bowels. However, it insensibly seemed to give the\nlie to his imputation; for his spirits rose to a more elevated pitch of\nmirth and good-fellowship; he sung, or rather roared, the Early Horn,\nso as to alarm the whole neighbourhood, and began to slabber his\ncompanions with a most bear-like affection. Yet whatever haste he made\nto the goal of ebriety, he was distanced by his brother baronet, who\nfrom the beginning of the party had made little other use of his mouth\nthan to receive the glass, and now sunk down upon the floor, in a state\nof temporary annihilation.\n\nHe was immediately carried to bed by the direction of Ferdinand, who\nnow saw himself in a manner possessor of that mine to which he had made\nsuch eager and artful advances. That he might, therefore, carry on the\napproaches in the same cautious manner, he gradually shook off the\ntrammels of sobriety, gave a loose to that spirit of freedom which good\nliquor commonly inspires, and, in the familiarity of drunkenness, owned\nhimself head of a noble family of Poland, from which he had been\nobliged to absent himself on account of an affair of honour, not yet\ncompromised.\n\nHaving made this confession, and laid strong injunctions of secrecy\nupon Sir Stentor, his countenance seemed to acquire from every\nsucceeding glass a new symptom of intoxication. They renewed their\nembraces, swore eternal friendship from that day, and swallowed fresh\nbumpers, till both being in all appearance quite overpowered, they\nbegan to yawn in concert, and even nod in their chairs. The knight\nseemed to resent the attacks of slumber, as so many impertinent\nattempts to interrupt their entertainment; he cursed his own propensity\nto sleep, imputing it to the d—-ed French climate, and proposed to\nengage in some pastime that would keep them awake. “Odd’s flesh!” cried\nthe Briton, “when I’m at home, I defy all the devils in hell to fasten\nmy eyelids together, if so be as I’m otherwise inclined. For there’s\nmother and sister Nan, and brother Numps and I, continue to divert\nourselves at all-fours, brag, cribbage, tetotum, husslecap, and\nchuck-varthing, and, thof I say it, that should n’t say it, I won’t\nturn my back to e’er a he in England, at any of these pastimes. And so,\nCount, if you are so disposed, I am your man, that is, in the way of\nfriendship, at which of these you shall please to pitch upon.”\n\nTo this proposal Fathom replied, he was quite ignorant of all the games\nhe had mentioned; but, in order to amuse Sir Stentor, he would play\nwith him at lansquenet, for a trifle, as he had laid it down for a\nmaxim, to risk nothing considerable at play. “Waunds!” answered the\nknight, “I hope you don’t think I come here in quest of money. Thank\nGod! I have a good landed estate worth five thousand a year, and owe no\nman a halfpenny; and I question whether there be many counts in your\nnation—no offence, I hope—that can say a bolder word. As for your\nlambskin net, I know nothing of the matter; but I will toss up with you\nfor a guinea, cross or pile, as the saying is; or, if there’s such a\nthing in this country as a box and dice, I love to hear the bones\nrattle sometimes.”\n\nFathom found some difficulty in concealing his joy at the mention of\nthis last amusement, which had been one of his chief studies, and in\nwhich he had made such progress, that he could calculate all the\nchances with the utmost exactness and certainty. However, he made shift\nto contain himself within due bounds, and, with seeming indifference,\nconsented to pass away an hour at hazard, provided the implements could\nbe procured. Accordingly, the landlord was consulted, and their desire\ngratified; the dice were produced, and the table resounded with the\neffects of their mutual eagerness. Fortune, at first, declared for the\nEnglishman, who was permitted by our adventurer to win twenty broad\npieces; and he was so elated with his success, as to accompany every\nlucky throw with a loud burst of laughter, and other savage and simple\nmanifestations of excessive joy, exclaiming, in a tone something less\nsweet than the bellowing of a bull, “Now for the main, Count,—odd! here\nthey come—here are the seven black stars, i’faith. Come along, my\nyellow boys—odd’s heart! I never liked the face of Lewis before.”\n\nFathom drew happy presages from these boyish raptures, and, after\nhaving indulged them for some time, began to avail himself of his\narithmetic, in consequence of which the knight was obliged to refund\nthe greatest part of his winning. Then he altered his note, and became\nas intemperate in his chagrin, as he had been before immoderate in his\nmirth. He cursed himself and his whole generation, d—-ed his bad luck,\nstamped with his feet upon the floor, and challenged Ferdinand to\ndouble stakes. This was a very welcome proposal to our hero, who found\nSir Stentor just such a subject as he had long desired to encounter\nwith; the more the Englishman laid, the more he lost, and Fathom took\ncare to inflame his passions, by certain well-timed sarcasms upon his\nwant of judgment, till at length he became quite outrageous, swore the\ndice were false, and threw them out at the window; pulled off his\nperiwig, and committed it to the flames, spoke with the most rancorous\ncontempt of his adversary’s skill, insisted upon his having stripped\nmany a better man, for all he was a Count, and threatening that, before\nthey parted, he should not only look like a Pole, but also smell like a\npole-cat.\n\nThis was a spirit which our adventurer industriously kept up, observing\nthat the English were dupes to all the world; and that, in point of\ngenius and address, they were no more than noisy braggadocios. In\nshort, another pair of dice was procured, the stakes were again raised,\nand, after several vicissitudes, fortune declared so much in favour of\nthe knight, that Fathom lost all the money in his pocket, amounting to\na pretty considerable sum. By this time he was warmed into uncommon\neagerness and impatience; being equally piqued at the success and\nprovoking exultations of his antagonist, whom he now invited to his\nlodgings, in order to decide the contest. Sir Stentor complied with\nthis request; the dispute was renewed with various success, till,\ntowards daylight, Ferdinand saw this noisy, raw, inexperienced\nsimpleton, carry off all his ready cash, together with his jewels, and\nalmost everything that was valuable about his person; and, to crown the\nwhole, the victor at parting told him with a most intolerable sneer,\nthat as soon as the Count should receive another remittance from\nPoland, he would give him his revenge.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\n\nHE BEARS HIS FATE LIKE A PHILOSOPHER; AND CONTRACTS ACQUAINTANCE WITH A\nVERY REMARKABLE PERSONAGE.\n\nThis was a proper subject for our hero to moralise upon; and\naccordingly it did not pass without his remarks; he found himself\nfairly foiled at his own weapons, reduced to indigence in a foreign\nland, and, what he chiefly regretted, robbed of all those gay\nexpectations he had indulged from his own supposed excellence in the\nwiles of fraud; for, upon a little recollection, he plainly perceived\nhe had fallen a sacrifice to the confederacy he had refused to join;\nand did not at all doubt that the dice were loaded for his destruction.\nBut, instead of beating his head against the wall, tearing his hair,\nimprecating vain curses upon himself, or betraying other frantic\nsymptoms of despair, he resolved to accommodate himself to his fate,\nand profit by the lesson he had so dearly bought.\n\nWith this intention, he immediately dismissed his valet, quitted his\nlodgings, retired to an obscure street on the other side of the river,\nand, covering one eye with a large patch of black silk, presented\nhimself in quality of a musician to the director of the opera, who,\nupon hearing a trial of his skill, received him into the band without\nfurther question. While he continued in this situation, he not only\nimproved his taste and execution in music, but likewise found frequent\nopportunities to extend his knowledge of mankind; for, besides the\nemployment he exercised in public, he was often concerned in private\nconcerts that were given in the hotels of noblemen; by which means he\nbecame more and more acquainted with the persons, manners, and\ncharacters of high life, which he contemplated with the most\nindustrious attention, as a spectator, who, being altogether\nunconcerned in the performance, is at more liberty to observe and enjoy\nthe particulars of the entertainment.\n\nIt was in one of those assemblies he had the pleasure of seeing his\nfriend Sir Stentor, dressed in the most fashionable manner, and\nbehaving with all the overstrained politesse of a native Frenchman. He\nwas accompanied by his brother knight and the abbe; and this\ntriumvirate, even in Fathom’s hearing, gave a most ludicrous detail of\nthe finesse they had practised upon the Polish Count, to their\nentertainer, who was ambassador from a certain court, and made himself\nextremely merry with the particulars of the relation. Indeed, they made\nshift to describe some of the circumstances in such a ridiculous light,\nthat our adventurer himself, smarting as he was with the disgrace,\ncould not help laughing in secret at the account. He afterwards made it\nhis business to inquire into the characters of the two British knights,\nand understood they were notorious sharpers, who had come abroad for\nthe good of their country, and now hunted in couple among a French\npack, that dispersed themselves through the public ordinaries, walks,\nand spectacles, in order to make a prey of incautious strangers.\n\nThe pride of Ferdinand was piqued at this information; and he was even\nanimated with the desire of making reprisals upon this fraternity, from\nwhich he ardently longed to retrieve his honour and effects. But the\nissue of his last adventure had reinforced his caution; and, for the\npresent, he found means to suppress the dictates of his avarice and\nambition; resolving to employ his whole penetration in reconnoitring\nthe ground, before he should venture to take the field again. He\ntherefore continued to act the part of a one-eyed fiddler, under the\nname of Fadini, and lived with incredible frugality, that he might save\na purse for his future operations. In this manner had he proceeded for\nthe space of ten months, during which he acquired a competent knowledge\nof the city of Paris, when his curiosity was attracted by certain\npeculiarities in the appearance of a man who lived in one of the upper\napartments belonging to the house in which he himself had fixed his\nhabitation.\n\nThis was a tall, thin, meagre figure, with a long black beard, an\naquiline nose, a brown complexion, and a most piercing vivacity in his\neyes. He seemed to be about the age of fifty, wore the Persian habit,\nand there was a remarkable severity in his aspect and demeanour. He and\nour adventurer had been fellow-lodgers for some time, and, according to\nthe laudable custom in these days, had hitherto remained as much\nestranged to one another, as if they had lived on opposite sides of the\nglobe; but of late the Persian seemed to regard our hero with\nparticular attention; when they chanced to meet on the staircase, or\nelsewhere, he bowed to Ferdinand with great solemnity, and complimented\nhim with the pas. He even proceeded, in the course of this\ncommunication, to open his mouth, and salute him with a good-morrow,\nand sometimes made the common remarks upon the weather. Fathom, who was\nnaturally complaisant, did not discourage these advances. On the\ncontrary, he behaved to him with marks of particular respect, and one\nday desired the favour of his company to breakfast.\n\nThis invitation the stranger declined with due acknowledgment, on\npretence of being out of order; and, in the meantime, our adventurer\nbethought himself of questioning the landlord concerning his outlandish\nguest. His curiosity was rather inflamed than satisfied with the\ninformation he could obtain from this quarter; for all he learned was,\nthat the Persian went by the name of Ali Beker, and that he had lived\nin the house for the space of four months, in a most solitary and\nparsimonious manner, without being visited by one living soul; that,\nfor some time after his arrival, he had been often heard to groan\ndismally in the night, and even to exclaim in an unknown language, as\nif he had laboured under some grievous affliction; and though the first\ntransports of his grief had subsided, it was easy to perceive he still\nindulged a deep-rooted melancholy; for the tears were frequently\nobserved to trickle down his beard. The commissaire of the quarter had\nat first ordered this Oriental to be watched in his outgoings,\naccording to the maxims of the French police; but his life was found so\nregular and inoffensive, that this precaution was soon set aside.\n\nAny man of humane sentiments, from the knowledge of these particulars,\nwould have been prompted to offer his services to the forlorn stranger;\nbut as our hero was devoid of all these infirmities of human nature, it\nwas necessary that other motives should produce the same effect. His\ncuriosity, therefore, joined with the hopes of converting the\nconfidence of Ali to his own emolument, effectually impelled him\ntowards his acquaintance; and, in a little time, they began to relish\nthe conversation of each other. For, as the reader may have already\nobserved, Fathom possessed all the arts of insinuation, and had\ndiscernment enough to perceive an air of dignity in the Persian, which\nthe humility of his circumstances could not conceal. He was, moreover,\na man of good understanding, not without a tincture of letters,\nperfectly well bred, though in a ceremonious style, extremely moral in\nhis discourse, and scrupulously nice in his notions of honour.\n\nOur hero conformed himself in all respects to the other’s opinions, and\nmanaged his discretion so as to pass upon him for a gentleman reduced\nby misfortunes to the exercise of an employment which was altogether\nunsuitable to his birth and quality. He made earnest and repeated\ntenders of his good offices to the stranger, and pressed him to make\nuse of his purse with such cordial perseverance, that, at length, Ali’s\nreserve was overcome, and he condescended to borrow of him a small sum,\nwhich in all probability, saved his life; for he had been driven to the\nutmost extremity of want before he would accept of this assistance.\n\nFathom, having gradually stole into his good graces, began to take\nnotice of many piteous sighs that escaped him in the moments of their\nintercourse, and seemed to denote an heart fraught with woe; and, on\npretence of administering consolation and counsel, begged leave to know\nthe cause of his distress, observing, that his mind would be\ndisburdened by such communication, and, perhaps, his grief alleviated\nby some means which they might jointly concert and execute in his\nbehalf.\n\nAli, thus solicited, would often shake his head, with marks of extreme\nsorrow and despondence, and, while the tears gushed from his eyes,\ndeclared that his distress was beyond the power of any remedy but\ndeath, and that, by making our hero his confidant, he should only\nextend his unhappiness to a friend, without feeling the least remission\nof his own torture. Notwithstanding these repeated declarations,\nFerdinand, who was well enough acquainted with the mind of man to know\nthat such importunity is seldom or never disagreeable, redoubled his\ninstances, together with his expressions of sympathy and esteem, until\nthe stranger was prevailed upon to gratify his curiosity and\nbenevolence. Having, therefore, secured the chamber door one night,\nwhile all the rest of the family were asleep, the unfortunate Ali\ndisclosed himself in these words.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\n\nTHE HISTORY OF THE NOBLE CASTILIAN.\n\nI should be ungrateful, as well as unwise, did I longer resist the\ndesire you express to know the particulars of that destiny which hath\ndriven me to this miserable disguise, and rendered me in all\nconsiderations the most wretched of men. I have felt your friendship,\nam confident of your honour, and though my misfortunes are such as can\nnever be repaired, because I am utterly cut off from hope, which is the\nwretch’s last comfort, yet I may, by your means, be enabled to bear\nthem with some degree of fortitude and resignation.\n\nKnow then, my name is not Ali; neither am I of Persian extraction. I\nhad once the honour to own myself a Castilian, and was, under the\nappellation of Don Diego de Zelos, respected as the head of one of the\nmost ancient families of that kingdom. Judge, then, how severe that\ndistress must be, which compels a Spaniard to renounce his country, his\nhonours, and his name. My youth was not spent in inglorious ease,\nneither did it waste unheeded in the rolls of fame. Before I had\nattained the age of nineteen, I was twice wounded in battle. I once\nfortunately recovered the standard of the regiment to which I belonged,\nafter it had been seized by the enemy; and, at another occasion, made\nshift to save the life of my colonel, when he lay at the mercy of an\nenraged barbarian.\n\nHe that thinks I recapitulate these particulars out of ostentation,\ndoes wrong to the unhappy Don Diego de Zelos, who, in having performed\nthese little acts of gallantry, thinks he has done nothing, but simply\napproved himself worthy of being called a Castilian. I mean only to do\njustice to my own character, and to make you acquainted with one of the\nmost remarkable incidents of my life. It was my fate, during my third\ncampaign, to command a troop of horse in the regiment of Don Gonzales\nOrgullo, between whom and my father a family feud had long been\nmaintained with great enmity; and that gentleman did not leave me\nwithout reason to believe he rejoiced at the opportunity of exercising\nhis resentment upon his adversary’s son; for he withheld from me that\ncountenance which my fellow-officers enjoyed, and found means to\nsubject me to divers mortifications, of which I was not at liberty to\ncomplain. These I bore in silence for some time, as part of my\nprobation in the character of a soldier; resolved, nevertheless, to\nemploy my interest at court for a removal into another corps, and to\ntake some future opportunity of explaining my sentiments to Don\nGonzales upon the injustice of his behaviour.\n\nWhile I animated myself with these sentiments against the\ndiscouragements I underwent, and the hard duty to which I was daily\nexposed, it was our fate to be concerned in the battle of Saragossa,\nwhere our regiment was so severely handled by the English infantry,\nthat it was forced to give ground with the loss of one half of its\nofficers and men. Don Gonzales, who acted as brigadier in another wing,\nbeing informed of our fate, and dreading the disgrace of his corps,\nwhich had never turned back to the enemy, put spurs to his horse, and,\nriding across the field at full speed, rallied our broken squadrons,\nand led us back to the charge with such intrepidity of behaviour, as\ndid not fail to inspire us all with uncommon courage and alacrity. For\nmy own part, I thought myself doubly interested to distinguish my\nvalour, not only on account of my own glory, but likewise on the\nsupposition, that, as I was acting under the eye of Gonzales, my\nconduct would be narrowly observed.\n\nI therefore exerted myself with unusual vigour, and as he began the\nattack with the remains of my troop, fought close by his side during\nthe rest of the engagement. I even acquired his applause in the very\nheat of battle. When his hat was struck off, and his horse fell under\nhim, I accommodated and remounted him upon my own, and, having seized\nfor my own use another that belonged to a common trooper, attended this\nstern commander as before, and seconded him in all his repeated\nefforts; but it was impossible to withstand the numbers and impetuosity\nof the foe, and Don Gonzales having had the mortification to see his\nregiment cut in pieces, and the greatest part of the army routed, was\nfain to yield to the fortune of the day; yet he retired as became a man\nof honour and a Castilian; that is, he marched off with great\ndeliberation in the rear of the Spanish troops, and frequently faced\nabout to check the pursuit of the enemy. Indeed, this exercise of his\ncourage had well-nigh cost him his life; for, in one of those\nwheelings, he was left almost alone, and a small party of the\nPortuguese horse had actually cut off our communication with the\nretreating forces of Spain.\n\nIn this dilemma, we had no other chance of saving our lives and\nliberty, than that of opening a passage sword in hand; and this was\nwhat Gonzales instantly resolved to attempt. We accordingly recommended\nour souls to God, and, charging the line abreast of one another, bore\ndown all opposition, and were in a fair way of accomplishing our\nretreat without further danger; but the gallant Orgullo, in crossing a\nditch, had the misfortune to be thrown from his horse, and was almost\nthe same instant overtaken by one of the Portuguese dragoons, whose\nsword was already suspended over his head, as he lay half stunned with\nhis fall; when I rode up, discharged a pistol in the ruffian’s brain,\nand, seating my colonel on his horse, had the good fortune to conduct\nhim to a place of safety.\n\nHere he was provided with such accommodation as his case required; for\nhe had been wounded in the battle, and dangerously bruised by his fall,\nand, when all the necessary steps were taken towards his recovery, I\ndesired to know if he had any further commands for his service, being\nresolved to join the army without delay. I thought proper to\ncommunicate this question by message, because he had not spoke one word\nto me during our retreat, notwithstanding the good office he had\nreceived at my hands; a reserve which I attributed to his pride, and\nresented accordingly. He no sooner understood my intention, than he\ndesired to see me in his apartment, and, as near as I can remember,\nspoke to this effect:—\n\n“Were your father Don Alonzo alive, I should now, in consequence of\nyour behaviour, banish every suggestion of resentment, and solicit his\nfriendship with great sincerity. Yes, Don Diego, your virtue hath\ntriumphed over that enmity I bore your house, and I upbraid myself with\nthe ungenerous treatment you have suffered under my command. But it is\nnot enough for me to withdraw that rigour which it was unjust to\nexercise, and would be wicked to maintain. I must likewise atone for\nthe injuries you have sustained, and make some suitable acknowledgment\nfor that life which I have twice to-day owed to your valour and\ngenerosity. Whatever interest I have at court shall be employed in your\nbehalf; and I have other designs in your favour, which shall be\ndisclosed in due season. Meanwhile, I desire you will still add one\nobligation to the debt which I have already incurred, and carry this\nbillet in person to my Estifania, who, from the news of this fatal\noverthrow must be in despair upon my account.”\n\nSo saying, he presented a letter, directed to his lady, which I\nreceived in a transport of joy, with expressions suitable to the\noccasion, and immediately set out for his country house, which happened\nto be about thirty leagues from the spot. This expedition was equally\nglorious and interesting; for my thoughts upon the road were engrossed\nby the hope of seeing Don Orgullo’s daughter and heiress Antonia, who\nwas reported to be a young lady of great beauty, and the most amiable\naccomplishments. However ridiculous it may seem for a man to conceive a\npassion for an object which he hath never beheld, certain it is, my\nsentiments were so much prepossessed by the fame of her qualifications,\nthat I must have fallen a victim to her charms, had they been much less\npowerful than they were. Notwithstanding the fatigues I had undergone\nin the field, I closed not an eye until I arrived at the gate of\nGonzales, being determined to precede the report of the battle, that\nMadame d’Orgullo might not be alarmed for the life of her husband.\n\nI declared my errand, and was introduced into a saloon, where I had not\nwaited above three minutes, when my colonel’s lady appeared, and in\ngreat confusion received the letter, exclaiming, “Heaven grant that Don\nGonzales be well!” In reading the contents, she underwent a variety of\nagitations; but, when she had perused the whole, her countenance\nregained its serenity, and, regarding me with an air of ineffable\ncomplacency, “Don Diego,” said she, “while I lament the national\ncalamity, in the defeat of our army, I at the same time feel the most\nsincere pleasure on seeing you upon this occasion, and, according to\nthe directions of my dear lord, bid you heartily welcome to this house,\nas his preserver and friend. I was not unacquainted with your character\nbefore this last triumph of your virtue, and have often prayed to\nHeaven for some lucky determination of that fatal quarrel which raged\nso long between the family of Gonzales and your father’s house. My\nprayers have been heard, the long-wished-for reconciliation is now\neffected, and I hope nothing will ever intervene to disturb this happy\nunion.”\n\nTo this polite and affectionate declaration, I made such a reply as\nbecame a young man, whose heart overflowed with joy and benevolence,\nand desired to know how soon her answer to my commander would be ready,\nthat I might gratify his impatience with all possible despatch. After\nhaving thanked me for this fresh proof of my attachment, she begged I\nwould retire into a chamber, and repose myself from the uncommon\nfatigues I must have undergone; but, finding I persisted in the\nresolution of returning to Don Gonzales, without allowing myself the\nleast benefit of sleep, she left me engaged in conversation with an\nuncle of Don Gonzales, who lodged in the house, and gave orders that a\ncollation should be prepared in another apartment, while she retired to\nher closet, and wrote a letter to her husband.\n\nIn less than an hour from my first arrival, I was introduced into a\nmost elegant dining-room, where a magnificent entertainment was served\nup, and where we were joined by Donna Estifania, and her beautiful\ndaughter the fair Antonia, who, advancing with the most amiable\nsweetness, thanked me in very warm expressions of acknowledgment, for\nthe generosity of my conduct towards her father. I had been ravished\nwith her first appearance, which far exceeded my imagination, and my\nfaculties were so disordered by this address, that I answered her\ncompliment with the most awkward confusion. But this disorder did not\nturn to my prejudice in the opinion of that lovely creature, who has\noften told me in the sequel, that she gave herself credit for that\nperplexity in my behaviour, and that I never appeared more worthy of\nher regard and affection than at that juncture, when my dress was\ndiscomposed, and my whole person disfigured by the toils and duty of\nthe preceding day; for this very dishabille presented itself to her\nreflection as the immediate effect of that very merit by which I was\nentitled to her esteem.\n\nWretch that I am! to survive the loss of such an excellent woman,\nendeared to my remembrance by the most tender offices of wedlock,\nhappily exercised for the space of five-and-twenty years! Forgive these\ntears; they are not the drops of weakness, but remorse. Not to trouble\nyou with idle particulars, suffice it is to say, I was favoured with\nsuch marks of distinction by Madame d’Orgullo, that she thought it\nincumbent upon her to let me know she had not overacted her\nhospitality, and, while we sat at table, accosted me in these words:\n“You will not be surprised, Don Diego, at my expressions of regard,\nwhich I own are unusual from a Spanish lady to a young cavalier like\nyou, when I communicate the contents of this letter from Don Gonzales.”\nSo saying, she put the billet into my hand, and I read these words, or\nwords to this effect:—\n\n“AMIABLE ESTIFANIA,—You will understand that I am as well as a person\ncan possibly be who hath this day lived to see the army of his king\ndefeated. If you would know the particulars of this unfortunate action,\nyour curiosity will be gratified by the bearer, Don Diego de Zelos, to\nwhose virtue and bravery I am twice indebted for my life. I therefore\ndesire you will receive him with that respect and gratitude which you\nshall think due for such an obligation; and, in entertaining him,\ndismiss that reserve which often disgraces the Spanish hospitality. In\na word, let your own virtue and beneficence conduct you upon this\noccasion, and let my Antonia’s endeavours be joined with your own in\ndoing honour to the preserver of her father! Adieu.”\n\nSuch a testimonial could not fail of being very agreeable to a young\nsoldier, who by this time had begun to indulge the transporting hope of\nbeing happy in the arms of the adorable Antonia. I professed myself\nextremely happy in having met with an opportunity of acquiring such a\ndegree of my colonel’s esteem, entertained them with a detail of his\npersonal prowess in the battle, and answered all their questions with\nthat moderation which every man ought to preserve in speaking of his\nown behaviour. Our repast being ended, I took my leave of the ladies,\nand at parting received a letter from Donna Estifania to her husband,\ntogether with a ring of great value, which she begged I would accept,\nas a token of her esteem. Thus loaded with honour and caresses, I set\nout on my return for the quarters of Don Gonzales, who could scarce\ncredit his own eyes when I delivered his lady’s billet; for he thought\nit impossible to perform such a journey in so short a time.\n\nWhen he had glanced over the paper, “Don Diego,” said he, “by your\nshort stay one would imagine you had met with indifferent reception at\nmy house. I hope Estifania has not been deficient in her duty?” I\nanswered this question, by assuring him my entertainment had been so\nagreeable in all respects, that nothing but my duty to him could have\ninduced me to give it up so soon. He then turned the conversation upon\nAntonia, and hinted his intention of giving her in marriage to a young\ncavalier, for whom he had a particular friendship. I was so much\naffected by this insinuation, which seemed at once to blast all my\nhopes of love and happiness, that the blood forsook my face; I was\nseized with an universal trepidation, and even obliged to retire, on\npretence of being suddenly taken ill.\n\nThough Gonzales seemed to impute this disorder to fatigue and want of\nrest, he in his heart ascribed it to the true cause; and, after having\nsounded my sentiments to his own satisfaction, blessed me with a\ndeclaration, importing, that I was the person upon whom he had pitched\nfor a son-in-law. I will not trouble you with a repetition of what\npassed on this interesting occasion, but proceed to observe, that his\nintention in my favour was far from being disagreeable to his lady; and\nthat, in a little time, I had the good fortune to espouse the charming\nAntonia, who submitted to the will of her father without reluctance.\n\nSoon after this happy event, I was, by the influence of Don Gonzales,\njoined to my own interest, promoted to the command of a regiment, and\nserved with honour during the remaining part of the war. After the\ntreaty of Utrecht, I was employed in reducing the Catalans to their\nallegiance; and, in an action with those obstinate rebels had the\nmisfortune to lose my father-in-law, who by that time was preferred to\nthe rank of a major-general. The virtuous Estifania did not long\nsurvive this melancholy accident; and the loss of these indulgent\nparents made such a deep impression upon the tender heart of my\nAntonia, that I took the first opportunity of removing her from a place\nin which every object served to cherish her grief, to a pleasant villa\nnear the city of Seville, which I purchased on account of its agreeable\nsituation. That I might the more perfectly enjoy the possession of my\namiable partner, who could no longer brook the thoughts of another\nseparation, peace was no sooner re-established than I obtained leave to\nresign my commission, and I wholly devoted myself to the joys of a\ndomestic life.\n\nHeaven seemed to smile upon our union, by blessing us with a son, whom,\nhowever, it was pleased to recall in his infancy, to our unspeakable\ngrief and mortification; but our mutual chagrin was afterwards\nalleviated by the birth of a daughter, who seemed born with every\naccomplishment to excite the love and admiration of mankind. Why did\nnature debase such a masterpiece with the mixture of an alloy, which\nhath involved herself and her whole family in perdition? But the ways\nof Providence are unsearchable. She hath paid the debt of her\ndegeneracy; peace be with her soul! The honour of my family is\nvindicated; though by a sacrifice which hath robbed me of everything\nelse that is valuable in life, and ruined my peace past all redemption.\nYes, my friend, all the tortures that human tyranny can inflict would\nbe ease, tranquillity, and delight, to the unspeakable pangs and\nhorrors I have felt.\n\nBut, to return from this digression.—Serafina, which was the name of\nthat little darling, as she grew up, not only disclosed all the natural\ngraces of external beauty, but likewise manifested the most engaging\nsweetness of disposition, and a capacity for acquiring with ease all\nthe accomplishments of her sex. It is impossible to convey any adequate\nidea of a parent’s raptures in the contemplation of such a fair\nblossom. She was the only pledge of our love, she was presumptive\nheiress to a large fortune, and likely to be the sole representative of\ntwo noble Castilian families. She was the delight of all who saw her,\nand a theme of praise for every tongue. You are not to suppose that the\neducation of such a child was neglected. Indeed, it wholly engrossed\nthe attention of me and my Antonia, and her proficiency rewarded our\ncare. Before she had attained the age of fifteen, she was mistress of\nevery elegant qualification, natural and acquired. Her person was, by\nthat time, the confessed pattern of beauty. Her voice was enchantingly\nsweet, and she touched the lute with the most ravishing dexterity.\nHeaven and earth! how did my breast dilate with joy at the thoughts of\nhaving given birth to such perfection! how did my heart gush with\npaternal fondness, whenever I beheld this ornament of my name! and what\nscenes of endearing transport have I enjoyed with my Antonia, in mutual\ncongratulation upon our parental happiness!\n\nSerafina, accomplished as she was, could not fail to make conquests\namong the Spanish cavaliers, who are famous for sensibility in love.\nIndeed, she never appeared without a numerous train of admirers; and\nthough we had bred her up in that freedom of conversation and\nintercourse which holds a middle space between the French licence and\nSpanish restraint, she was now so much exposed to the addresses of\npromiscuous gallantry, that we found it necessary to retrench the\nliberty of our house, and behave to our male visitants with great\nreserve and circumspection, that our honour and peace might run no risk\nfrom the youth and inexperience of our daughter.\n\nThis caution produced overtures from a great many young gentlemen of\nrank and distinction, who courted my alliance, by demanding Serafina in\nmarriage; and from the number I had actually selected one person, who\nwas in all respects worthy the possession of such an inestimable prize.\nHis name was Don Manuel de Mendoza. His birth was noble, and his\ncharacter dignified with repeated acts of generosity and virtue. Yet,\nbefore I would signify to him my approbation of his suit, I resolved to\ninform myself whether or not the heart of Serafina was totally\nunengaged, and indifferent to any other object, that I might not lay a\ntyrannical restraint upon her inclinations. The result of my inquiry\nwas a full conviction of her having hitherto been deaf to the voice of\nlove; and this piece of information, together with my own sentiments in\nhis favour, I communicated to Don Manuel, who heard these tidings with\ntransports of gratitude and joy. He was immediately favoured with\nopportunities of acquiring the affection of my daughter, and his\nendeavours were at first received with such respectful civility, as\nmight have been easily warmed into a mutual passion, had not the evil\ngenius of our family interposed.\n\nO my friend! how shall I describe the depravity of that unhappy\nvirgin’s sentiments! how recount the particulars of my own dishonour! I\nthat am descended from a long line of illustrious Castilians, who never\nreceived an injury they did not revenge, but washed away every blemish\nin their fame with the blood of those who attempted to stain it! In\nthat circumstance I have imitated the example of my glorious\nprogenitors, and that consideration alone hath supported me against all\nthe assaults of despair.\n\nAs I grudged no pains and expense in perfecting the education of\nSerafina, my doors were open to every person who made an extraordinary\nfigure in the profession of those amusing sciences in which she\ndelighted. The house of Don Diego de Zelos was a little academy for\npainting, poetry, and music; and Heaven decreed that it should fall a\nsacrifice to its regard for these fatal and delusive arts. Among other\npreceptors, it was her fate to be under the instruction of a cursed\nGerman, who, though his profession was drawing, understood the elements\nand theory of music, possessed a large fund of learning and taste, and\nwas a person remarkable for his agreeable conversation. This traitor,\nwho like you had lost one eye, I not only admitted into my house for\nthe improvement of my daughter, but even distinguished with particular\nmarks of confidence and favour, little thinking he had either\ninclination or capacity to debauch the sentiments of my child. I was\nrejoiced beyond measure to see with what alacrity she received his\nlessons, with what avidity she listened to his discourse, which was\nalways equally moral, instructing, and entertaining.\n\nAntonia seemed to vie with me in expressions of regard for this\naccomplished stranger, whom she could not help supposing to be a person\nof rank and family, reduced to his present situation by some\nunfortunate vicissitude of fate. I was disposed to concur with this\nopinion, and actually conjured him to make me his confidant, with such\nprotestations as left him no room to doubt my honour and beneficence;\nbut he still persisted in declaring himself the son of an obscure\nmechanic in Bohemia; an origin to which surely no man would pretend who\nhad the least claim to nobility of birth. While I was thus undeceived\nin my conjecture touching his birth and quality, I was confirmed in an\nopinion of his integrity and moderation, and looked upon him as a man\nof honour, in despite of the lowness of his pedigree. Nevertheless, he\nwas at bottom a most perfidious wretch, and all this modesty and\nself-denial were the effects of the most villanous dissimulation, a\ncloak under which he, unsuspected, robbed me of my honour and my peace.\n\nNot to trouble you with particulars, the recital of which would tear my\nheart-strings with indignation and remorse, I shall only observe, that,\nby the power of his infernal insinuation, he fascinated the heart of\nSerafina, brought over Antonia herself to the interests of his passion,\nand at once detached them both from their duty and religion. Heaven and\nearth! how dangerous, how irresistible is the power of infatuation!\nWhile I remained in the midst of this blind security, waiting for the\nnuptials of my daughter, and indulging myself with the vain prospect of\nher approaching felicity, Antonia found means to protract the\nnegotiations of the marriage, by representing that it would be a pity\nto deprive Serafina of the opportunity she then had of profiting by the\nGerman’s instructions; and, upon that account, I prevailed upon Don\nManuel to bridle the impatience of his love.\n\nDuring this interval, as I one evening enjoyed the cool air in my own\ngarden, I was accosted by an old duenna, who had been my nurse and\nlived in the family since the time of my childhood.—“My duty,” said\nshe, “will no longer permit me to wink in silence at the wrongs I see\nyou daily suffer. Dismiss that German from your house without delay, if\nyou respect the glory of your name, and the rights of our holy\nreligion; the stranger is an abominable heretic; and, grant Heaven! he\nmay not have already poisoned the minds of those you hold most dear.” I\nhad been extremely alarmed at the beginning of this address; but,\nfinding the imputation limited to the article of religion, in which,\nthank God, I am no bigot, I recovered my serenity of disposition,\nthanked the old woman for her zeal, commended her piety, and encouraged\nher to persevere in making observations on such subjects as should\nconcern my honour and my quiet.\n\nWe live in such a world of wickedness and fraud, that a man cannot be\ntoo vigilant in his own defence: had I employed such spies from the\nbeginning, I should in all probability have been at this day in\npossession of every comfort that renders life agreeable. The duenna,\nthus authorised, employed her sagacity with such success, that I had\nreason to suspect the German of a design upon the heart of Serafina;\nbut, as the presumptions did not amount to conviction, I contented\nmyself with exiling him from my house, under the pretext of having\ndiscovered that he was an enemy to the Catholic church; and forthwith\nappointed a day for the celebration of my daughter’s marriage with Don\nManuel de Mendoza. I could easily perceive a cloud of melancholy\noverspread the faces of Serafina and her mother, when I declared these\nmy resolutions; but, as they made no objection to what I proposed, I\ndid not at that time enter into an explanation of the true motives that\ninfluenced my conduct. Both parties were probably afraid of such\nexpostulation.\n\nMeanwhile, preparations were made for the espousals of Serafina; and,\nnotwithstanding the anxiety I had undergone, on account of her\nconnexion with the German, I began to think that her duty, her glory,\nhad triumphed over all such low-born considerations, if ever they had\nbeen entertained; because she, and even Antonia, seemed to expect the\nceremony with resignation, though the features of both still retained\nevident marks of concern, which I willingly imputed to the mutual\nprospect of their separation. This, however, was but a faithless calm,\nthat soon, ah! too soon, brought forth a tempest which hath wrecked my\nhopes.\n\nTwo days before the appointed union of Don Manuel and Serafina, I was\ninformed by the duenna, that, while she accompanied Antonia’s\nwaiting-maid at church, she had seen her receive a billet from an old\nwoman, who, kneeling at her side, had conveyed it in such a mysterious\nmanner, as awakened the duenna’s apprehensions about her young lady;\nshe had therefore hastened home to communicate this piece of\nintelligence, that I might have an opportunity of examining the\nmessenger before she could have time to deposit her trust. I could not\nhelp shivering with fearful presages upon this occasion, and even\nabhorring the person to whose duty and zeal I was beholden for the\nintelligence, even while I endeavoured to persuade myself that the\ninquiry would end in the detection of some paltry intrigue between the\nmaid and her own gallant. I intercepted her in returning from church,\nand, commanding her to follow me to a convenient place, extorted from\nher, by dint of threats, the fatal letter, which I read to this\neffect:—\n\n“The whole business of my life, O divine Serafina! will be to repay\nthat affection I have been so happy as to engage. With what transport\nthen shall I obey your summons, in performing that enterprise, which\nwill rescue you from the bed of a detested rival, and put myself in\nfull possession of a jewel which I value infinitely more than life!\nYes, adorable creature! I have provided everything for our escape, and\nat midnight will attend you in your own apartment, from whence you\nshall be conveyed into a land of liberty and peace, where you will,\nunmolested, enjoy the purity of that religion you have espoused, and in\nfull security bless the arms of your ever faithful, ORLANDO.”\n\nWere you a fond parent, a tender husband, and a noble Castilian, I\nshould not need to mention the unutterable horrors that took possession\nof my bosom, when I perused this accursed letter, by which I learned\nthe apostasy, disobedience, and degeneracy of my idolised Serafina, who\nhad overthrown and destroyed the whole plan of felicity which I had\nerected, and blasted all the glories of my name; and when the wretched\nmessenger, terrified by my menaces and agitation, confessed that\nAntonia herself was privy to the guilt of her daughter, whom she had\nsolemnly betrothed to that vile German, in the sight of Heaven, and\nthat by her connivance this plebeian intended, that very night, to\nbereave me of my child, I was for some moments stupefied with grief and\namazement, that gave way to an ecstasy of rage, which had well-nigh\nterminated in despair and distraction.\n\nI now tremble, and my head grows giddy with the remembrance of that\ndreadful occasion. Behold how the drops trickle down my forehead; this\nagony is a fierce and familiar visitant; I shall banish it anon. I\nsummoned my pride, my resentment, to my assistance; these are the\ncordials that support me against all other reflections; those were the\nauxiliaries that enabled me, in the day of trial, to perform that\nsacrifice which my honour demanded, in a strain so loud as to drown the\ncries of nature, love, and compassion. Yes, they espoused that glory\nwhich humanity would have betrayed, and my revenge was noble, though\nunnatural.\n\nMy scheme was soon laid, my resolution soon taken; I privately confined\nthe wretch who had been the industrious slave of this infamous\nconspiracy, that she might take no step to frustrate or interrupt the\nexecution of my design. Then repairing to the house of an apothecary\nwho was devoted to my service, communicated my intention, which he\ndurst not condemn, and could not reveal, without breaking the oath of\nsecrecy I had imposed; and he furnished me with two vials of poison for\nthe dismal catastrophe I had planned. Thus provided, I, on pretence of\nsudden business at Seville, carefully avoided the dear, the wretched\npair, whom I had devoted to death, that my heart might not relent, by\nmeans of those tender ideas which the sight of them would have\ninfallibly inspired; and, when daylight vanished, took my station near\nthat part of the house through which the villain must have entered on\nhis hellish purpose. There I stood, in a state of horrid expectation,\nmy soul ravaged with the different passions that assailed it, until the\nfatal moment arrived; when I perceived the traitor approach the window\nof a lower apartment, which led into that of Serafina, and gently\nlifting the casement, which was purposely left unsecured, insinuated\nhalf of his body into the house. Then rushing upon him, in a transport\nof fury, I plunged my sword into his heart, crying, “Villain! receive\nthe reward of thy treachery and presumption.”\n\nThe steel was so well aimed as to render a repetition of the stroke\nunnecessary; he uttered one groan, and fell breathless at my feet.\nExulting with this first success of my revenge, I penetrated into the\nchamber where the robber of my peace was expected by the unhappy\nSerafina and her mother, who, seeing me enter with a most savage\naspect, and a sword reeking with the vengeance I had taken, seemed\nalmost petrified with fear. “Behold,” said I, “the blood of that base\nplebeian, who made an attempt upon the honour of my house; your\nconspiracy against the unfortunate Don Diego de Zelos is now\ndiscovered; that presumptuous slave, the favoured Orlando, is now no\nmore.”\n\nScarce had I pronounced these words, when a loud scream was uttered by\nboth the unhappy victims. “If Orlando is slain,” cried the infatuated\nSerafina, “what have I to do with life? O my dear lord! my husband, and\nmy lover! how are our promised joys at once cut off! here, strike, my\nfather! complete your barbarous sacrifice! the spirit of the murdered\nOrlando still hovers for his wife.” These frantic exclamations, in\nwhich she was joined by Antonia, kept up the fury of my resentment,\nwhich by meekness and submission might have been weakened and rendered\nineffectual. “Yes, hapless wretches,” I replied, “ye shall enjoy your\nwish: the honour of my name requires that both shall die; yet I will\nnot mangle the breast of Antonia, on which I have so often reposed; I\nwill not shed the blood of Zelos, nor disfigure the beauteous form of\nSerafina, on which I have so often gazed with wonder and unspeakable\ndelight. Here is an elixir, to which I trust the consummation of my\nrevenge.”\n\nSo saying, I emptied the vials into separate cups, and, presenting one\nin each hand, the miserable, the fair offenders instantly received the\ndestined draughts, which they drank without hesitation; then praying to\nheaven for the wretched Don Diego, sunk upon the same couch, and\nexpired without a groan. O well-contrived beverage! O happy\ncomposition, by which all the miseries of life are so easily cured!\n\nSuch was the fate of Antonia and Serafina; these hands were the\ninstruments that deprived them of life, these eyes beheld them the\nrichest prize that death had ever won. Powers supreme! does Don Diego\nlive to make this recapitulation? I have done my duty; but ah! I am\nhaunted by the furies of remorse; I am tortured with the incessant\nstings of remembrance and regret; even now the images of my wife and\ndaughter present themselves to my imagination. All the scenes of\nhappiness I have enjoyed as a lover, husband, and parent, all the\nendearing hopes I have cherished, now pass in review before me,\nembittering the circumstances of my inexpressible woe; and I consider\nmyself as a solitary outcast from all the comforts of society. But,\nenough of these unmanly complaints; the yearnings of nature are too\nimportunate.\n\nHaving completed my vengeance, I retired into my closet, and,\nfurnishing myself with some ready money and jewels of considerable\nvalue, went into the stable, saddled my favourite steed, which I\ninstantly mounted, and, before the tumults of my breast subsided, found\nmyself at the town of St. Lucar. There I learned from inquiry, that\nthere was a Dutch bark in the harbour ready to sail; upon which I\naddressed myself to the master, who, for a suitable gratification, was\nprevailed upon to weigh anchor that same night; so that, embarking\nwithout delay, I soon bid eternal adieu to my native country. It was\nnot from reason and reflection that I took these measures for my\npersonal safety; but, in consequence of an involuntary instinct, that\nseems to operate in the animal machine, while the faculty of thinking\nis suspended.\n\nTo what a dreadful reckoning was I called, when reason resumed her\nfunction! You may believe me, my friend, when I assure you, that I\nshould not have outlived those tragedies I acted, had I not been\nrestrained from doing violence upon myself by certain considerations,\nwhich no man of honour ought to set aside. I could not bear the thought\nof falling ingloriously by the hand of an executioner, and entailing\ndisgrace upon a family that knew no stain; and I was deterred from\nputting an end to my own misery, by the apprehension of posthumous\ncensure, which would have represented me as a desponding wretch,\nutterly destitute of that patience, fortitude, and resignation, which\nare the characteristics of a true Castilian. I was also influenced by\nreligious motives that suggested to me the necessity of living to\natone, by my sufferings and sorrow, for the guilt I had incurred in\ncomplying with a savage punctilio, which is, I fear, displeasing in the\nsight of Heaven.\n\nThese were the reasons that opposed my entrance into that peaceful\nharbour which death presented to my view; and they were soon reinforced\nby another principle that sanctioned my determination to continue at\nthe servile oar of life. In consequence of unfavourable winds, our\nvessel for some days made small progress in her voyage to Holland, and\nnear the coast of Gallicia we were joined by an English ship from Vigo,\nthe master of which gave us to understand, that before he set sail, a\ncourier had arrived from Madrid at that place, with orders for the\ncorregidore to prevent the escape of any native Spaniard by sea from\nany port within his district; and to use his utmost endeavours to\napprehend the person of Don Diego de Zelos, who was suspected of\ntreasonable practices against the state. Such an order, with a minute\ndescription of my person, was at the same time despatched to all the\nseaports and frontier places in Spain.\n\nYou may easily suppose how I, who was already overwhelmed with\ndistress, could bear this aggravation of misfortune and disgrace: I,\nwho had always maintained the reputation of loyalty, which was acquired\nat the hazard of my life, and the expense of my blood. To deal\ncandidly, I must own, that this intelligence roused me from a lethargy\nof grief which had begun to overpower my faculties. I immediately\nimputed this dishonourable charge to the evil offices of some villain,\nwho had basely taken the advantage of my deplorable situation, and I\nwas inflamed, inspirited with the desire of vindicating my fame, and\nrevenging the injury. Thus animated, I resolved to disguise myself\neffectually from the observation of those spies which every nation\nfinds its account in employing in foreign countries; I purchased this\nhabit from the Dutch navigator, in whose house I kept myself concealed,\nafter our arrival at Amsterdam, until my beard was grown to a\nsufficient length to favour my design, and then appeared as a Persian\ndealer in jewels. As I could gain no satisfactory information touching\nmyself in this country, had no purpose to pursue, and was extremely\nmiserable among a people, who, being mercenary and unsocial, were very\nill adapted to alleviate the horrors of my condition, I gratified my\nlandlord for his important services, with the best part of my effects;\nand having, by his means, procured a certificate from the magistracy,\nrepaired to Rotterdam, from whence I set out in a travelling carriage\nfor Antwerp, on my way to this capital; hoping, with a succession of\ndifferent objects, to mitigate the anguish of my mind, and by the most\nindustrious inquiry, to learn such particulars of that false\nimpeachment, as would enable me to take measures for my own\njustification, as well as for projecting a plan of revenge against the\nvile perfidious author.\n\nThis, I imagined, would be no difficult task, considering the\nfriendship and intercourse subsisting between the Spanish and French\nnations, and the communicative disposition for which the Parisians are\nrenowned; but I have found myself egregiously deceived in my\nexpectation. The officers of police in this city are so inquisitive and\nvigilant that the most minute action of a stranger is scrutinised with\ngreat severity; and, although the inhabitants are very frank in\ndiscoursing on indifferent subjects, they are at the same time\nextremely cautious in avoiding all conversation that turns upon state\noccurrences and maxims of government. In a word, the peculiarity of my\nappearance subjects me so much to particular observation, that I have\nhitherto thought proper to devour my griefs in silence, and even to\nbear the want of almost every convenience, rather than hazard a\npremature discovery, by offering my jewels to sale.\n\nIn this emergency I have been so far fortunate as to become acquainted\nwith you, whom I look upon as a man of honour and humanity. Indeed, I\nwas at first sight prepossessed in your favour, for, notwithstanding\nthe mistakes which men daily commit in judging from appearances, there\nis something in the physiognomy of a stranger from which one cannot\nhelp forming an opinion of his character and disposition. For once, my\npenetration hath not failed me; your behaviour justifies my decision;\nyou have treated me with that sympathy and respect which none but the\ngenerous will pay to the unfortunate. I have trusted you accordingly. I\nhave put my life, my honour, in your power; and I must beg leave to\ndepend upon your friendship, for obtaining that satisfaction for which\nalone I seek to live. Your employment engages you in the gay world; you\ndaily mingle with the societies of men; the domestics of the Spanish\nambassador will not shun your acquaintance; you may frequent the\ncoffee-houses to which they resort; and, in the course of these\noccasions, unsuspected inform yourself of that mysterious charge which\nlies heavy on the fame of the unfortunate Don Diego. I must likewise\nimplore your assistance in converting my jewels into money, that I may\nbreathe independent of man, until Heaven shall permit me to finish this\nweary pilgrimage of life.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\n\nA FLAGRANT INSTANCE OF FATHOM’S VIRTUE, IN THE MANNER OF HIS RETREAT TO\nENGLAND.\n\nFathom, who had lent an attentive ear to every circumstance of this\ndisastrous story, no sooner heard it concluded, than, with an aspect of\ngenerous and cordial compassion, not even unattended with tears, he\ncondoled the lamentable fate of Don Diego de Zelos, deplored the\nuntimely death of the gentle Antonia and the fair Serafina, and\nundertook the interest of the wretched Castilian with such warmth of\nsympathising zeal, as drew a flood from his eyes, while he wrung his\nbenefactor’s hand in a transport of gratitude. Those were literally\ntears of joy, or at least of satisfaction, on both sides; as our hero\nwept with affection and attachment to the jewels that were to be\ncommitted to his care; but, far from discovering the true source of his\ntenderness, he affected to dissuade the Spaniard from parting with the\ndiamonds, which he counselled him to reserve for a more pressing\noccasion; and, in the meantime, earnestly entreated him to depend upon\nhis friendship for present relief.\n\nThis generous proffer served only to confirm Don Diego’s resolution,\nwhich he forthwith executed, by putting into the hands of Ferdinand\njewels to the value of a thousand crowns, and desiring him to detain\nfor his own use any part of the sum they would raise. Our adventurer\nthanked him for the good opinion he entertained of his integrity, an\nopinion fully manifested in honouring him with such important\nconfidence, and assured him he would transact his affairs with the\nutmost diligence, caution, and despatch. The evening being by this time\nalmost consumed, these new allies retired separately to rest; though\neach passed the night without repose, in very different reflections,\nthe Castilian being, as usual, agitated with the unceasing pangs of his\nunalterable misery, interspersed with gleaming hopes of revenge; and\nFathom being kept awake with revolving plans for turning his\nfellow-lodger’s credulity to his own advantage. From the nature of the\nSpaniard’s situation, he might have appropriated the jewels to himself,\nand remained in Paris without fear of a prosecution, because the\ninjured party had, by the above narrative, left his life and liberty at\ndiscretion.—But he did not think himself secure from the personal\nresentment of an enraged desperate Castilian; and therefore determined\nto withdraw himself privately into that country where he had all along\nproposed to fix the standard of his finesse, which fortune had now\nempowered him to exercise according to his wish.\n\nBent upon this retreat, he went abroad in the morning, on pretence of\nacting in the concerns of his friend Don Diego, and having hired a\npost-chaise to be ready at the dawning of next day, returned to his\nlodgings, where he cajoled the Spaniard with a feigned report of his\nnegotiation; then, securing his most valuable effects about his person,\narose with the cock, repaired to the place at which he had appointed to\nmeet the postillion with the carriage, and set out for England without\nfurther delay, leaving the unhappy Zelos to the horrors of indigence,\nand the additional agony of this fresh disappointment. Yet he was not\nthe only person affected by the abrupt departure of Fathom, which was\nhastened by the importunities, threats, and reproaches of his\nlandlord’s daughter, whom he had debauched under promise of marriage,\nand now left in the fourth month of her pregnancy.\n\nNotwithstanding the dangerous adventure in which he had been formerly\ninvolved by travelling in the night, he did not think proper to make\nthe usual halts on this journey, for sleep or refreshment, nor did he\nonce quit the chaise till his arrival at Boulogne, which he reached in\ntwenty hours after his departure from Paris. Here he thought he might\nsafely indulge himself with a comfortable meal; accordingly he bespoke\na poulard for dinner, and while that was preparing, went forth to view\nthe city and harbour. When he beheld the white cliffs of Albion, his\nheart throbbed with all the joy of a beloved son, who, after a tedious\nand fatiguing voyage, reviews the chimneys of his father’s house. He\nsurveyed the neighbouring coast of England with fond and longing eyes,\nlike another Moses, reconnoitring the land of Canaan from the top of\nMount Pisgah; and to such a degree of impatience was he inflamed by the\nsight, that, instead of proceeding to Calais, he resolved to take his\npassage directly from Boulogne, even if he should hire a vessel for the\npurpose. With these sentiments, he inquired if there was any ship bound\nfor England, and was so fortunate as to find the master of a small\nbark, who intended to weigh anchor for Deal that same evening at high\nwater.\n\nTransported with this information, he immediately agreed for his\npassage, sold the post-chaise to his landlord for thirty guineas, as a\npiece of furniture for which he could have no further use, purchased a\nportmanteau, together with some linen and wearing apparel, and, at the\nrecommendation of his host, took into his service an extra postillion\nor helper, who had formerly worn the livery of a travelling marquis.\nThis new domestic, whose name was Maurice, underwent, with great\napplause, the examination of our hero, who perceived in him a fund of\nsagacity and presence of mind, by which he was excellently qualified\nfor being the valet of an adventurer. He was therefore accommodated\nwith a second-hand suit and another shirt, and at once listed under the\nbanners of Count Fathom, who spent the whole afternoon in giving him\nproper instructions for the regulation of his conduct.\n\nHaving settled these preliminaries to his own satisfaction, he and his\nbaggage were embarked about six o’clock in the month of September, and\nit was not without emotion that he found himself benighted upon the\ngreat deep, of which, before the preceding day, he had never enjoyed\neven the most distant prospect. However, he was not a man to be afraid,\nwhere there was really no appearance of danger; and the agreeable\npresages of future fortune supported his spirits, amidst the\ndisagreeable nausea which commonly attends landsmen at sea, until he\nwas set ashore upon the beach at Deal, which he entered in good health\nabout seven o’clock in the morning.\n\nLike Caesar, however, he found some difficulty in landing, on account\nof the swelling surf, that tumbled about with such violence as had\nalmost overset the cutter that carried him on shore; and, in his\neagerness to jump upon the strand, his foot slipped from the side of\nthe boat, so that he was thrown forwards in an horizontal direction,\nand his hands were the first parts of him that touched English ground.\nUpon this occasion, he, in imitation of Scipio’s behaviour on the coast\nof Africa, hailed the omen, and, grasping a handful of the sand, was\nheard to exclaim, in the Italian language: “Ah, ah, Old England, I have\nthee fast.”\n\nAs he walked up to the inn, followed by Maurice loaded with his\nportmanteau, he congratulated himself upon his happy voyage, and the\npeaceable possession of his spoil, and could not help snuffing up the\nBritish air with marks of infinite relish and satisfaction. His first\ncare was to recompense himself for the want of sleep he had undergone,\nand, after he had sufficiently recruited himself with several hours of\nuninterrupted repose, he set out in a post-chaise for Canterbury, where\nhe took a place in the London stage, which he was told would depart\nnext morning, the coach being already full. On this very first day of\nhis arrival, he perceived between the English and the people among whom\nhe had hitherto lived, such essential difference in customs,\nappearance, and way of living, as inspired him with high notions of\nthat British freedom, opulence, and convenience, on which he had often\nheard his mother expatiate. On the road, he feasted his eyesight with\nthe verdant hills covered with flocks of sheep, the fruitful vales\nparcelled out into cultivated enclosures; the very cattle seemed to\nprofit by the wealth of their masters, being large, sturdy, and sleek,\nand every peasant breathed the insolence of liberty and independence.\nIn a word, he viewed the wide-extended plains of Kent with a lover’s\neye, and, his ambition becoming romantic, could not help fancying\nhimself another conqueror of the isle.\n\nHe was not, however, long amused by these vain chimeras, which soon\nvanished before other reflections of more importance and solidity. His\nimagination, it must be owned, was at all times too chaste to admit\nthose overweening hopes, which often mislead the mind of the projector.\nHe had studied mankind with incredible diligence, and knew perfectly\nwell how far he could depend on the passions and foibles of human\nnature. That he might now act consistent with his former sagacity, he\nresolved to pass himself upon his fellow-travellers for a French\ngentleman, equally a stranger to the language and country of England,\nin order to glean from their discourse such intelligence as might avail\nhim in his future operations; and his lacquey was tutored accordingly.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\n\nSOME ACCOUNT OF HIS FELLOW-TRAVELLERS.\n\nThose who had taken places for the coach, understanding the sixth seat\nwas engaged by a foreigner, determined to profit by his ignorance; and,\nwith that politeness which is peculiar to this happy island, fixed\nthemselves in the vehicle, in such a manner, before he had the least\nintimation of their design, that he found it barely practicable to\ninsinuate himself sidelong between a corpulent quaker and a fat Wapping\nlandlady, in which attitude he stuck fast, like a thin quarto between\ntwo voluminous dictionaries on a bookseller’s shelf. And, as if the\npain and inconvenience of such compression was not sufficient matter of\nchagrin, the greatest part of the company entertained themselves with\nlaughing at his ludicrous station.\n\nThe jolly dame at his left hand observed, with a loud exclamation of\nmirth, that monsieur would be soon better acquainted with a buttock of\nEnglish beef; and said, by that time they should arrive at their\ndining-place, he might be spitted without larding. “Yes, verily,”\nreplied Obadiah, who was a wag in his way, “but the swine’s fat will be\nall on one side.”—“So much the better for you,” cried mine hostess,\n“for that side is all your own.” The quaker was not so much\ndisconcerted by the quickness of this repartee, but that he answered\nwith great deliberation, “I thank thee for thy love, but will not\nprofit by thy loss, especially as I like not the savour of these\noutlandish fowls; they are profane birds of passage, relished only by\nthe children of vanity, like thee.”\n\nThe plump gentlewoman took umbrage at this last expression, which she\nconsidered as a double reproach, and repeated the words, “Children of\nvanity!” with an emphasis of resentment. “I believe, if the truth were\nknown,” said she, “there’s more vanity than midriff in that great belly\nof yours, for all your pretending to humility and religion. Sirrah! my\ncorporation is made up of good, wholesome, English fat; but you are\npuffed up with the wind of vanity and delusion; and when it begins to\ngripe your entrails, you pretend to have a motion, and then get up and\npreach nonsense. Yet you’ll take it upon you to call your betters\nchildren. Marry come up, Mr. Goosecap, I have got children that are as\ngood men as you, or any hypocritical trembler in England.”\n\nA person who sat opposite to the quaker, hearing this remonstrance,\nwhich seemed pregnant with contention, interposed in the conversation\nwith a conscious leer, and begged there might be no rupture between the\nspirit and the flesh. By this remonstrance he relieved Obadiah from the\nsatire of this female orator, and brought the whole vengeance of her\nelocution upon his own head. “Flesh!” cried she, with all the ferocity\nof an enraged Thalestris; “none of your names, Mr. Yellowchaps. What! I\nwarrant you have an antipathy to flesh, because you yourself are\nnothing but skin and bone. I suppose you are some poor starved\njourneyman tailor come from France, where you have been learning to\ncabbage, and have not seen a good meal of victuals these seven years.\nYou have been living upon rye-bread and soup-maigre, and now you come\nover like a walking atomy with a rat’s tail at your wig, and a tinsey\njacket. And so, forsooth, you set up for a gentleman, and pretend to\nfind fault with a sirloin of roast beef.”\n\nThe gentleman heard this address with admirable patience, and when she\nhad rung out her alarm, very coolly replied, “Anything but your\nstinking fish madam. Since when, I pray, have you travelled in\nstage-coaches, and left off your old profession of crying oysters in\nwinter, and rotten mackerel in June? You was then known by the name of\nKate Brawn, and in good repute among the ale-houses in Thames Street,\ntill that unlucky amour with the master of a corn-vessel, in which he\nwas unfortunately detected by his own spouse; but you seem to have\nrisen by that fall; and I wish you joy of your present plight. Though,\nconsidering your education on Bear Quay, you can give but a sorry\naccount of yourself.”\n\nThe Amazon, though neither exhausted nor dismayed, was really\nconfounded at the temper and assurance of this antagonist, who had\ngathered all these anecdotes from the fertility of his own invention;\nafter a short pause, however, she poured forth a torrent of obloquy\nsufficient to overwhelm any person who had not been used to take up\narms against such seas of trouble; and a dispute ensued, which would\nhave not only disgraced the best orators on the Thames, but even have\nmade a figure in the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries, during\nwhich the Athenian matrons rallied one another from different waggons,\nwith that freedom of altercation so happily preserved in this our age\nand country.\n\nSuch a redundancy of epithets, and variety of metaphors, tropes, and\nfigures were uttered between these well-matched opponents, that an epic\nbard would have found his account in listening to the contest; which,\nin all probability, would not have been confined to words, had it not\nbeen interrupted for the sake of a young woman of an agreeable\ncountenance and modest carriage; who, being shocked at some of their\nflowers of speech, and terrified by the menacing looks and gestures of\nthe fiery-featured dame, began to scream aloud, and beg leave to quit\nthe coach. Her perturbation put an end to the high debate. The sixth\npassenger, who had not opened his mouth, endeavoured to comfort her\nwith assurances of protection; the quaker proposed a cessation of arms;\nthe male disputant acquiesced in the proposal, assuring the company he\nhad entered the lists for their entertainment only, without acquiring\nthe least grudge or ill-will to the fat gentlewoman, whom he protested\nhe had never seen before that day, and who, for aught he knew, was a\nperson of credit and reputation. He then held forth his hand in token\nof amity, and asked pardon of the offended party, who was appeased by\nhis submission; and, in testimony of her benevolence, presented to the\nother female, whom she had discomposed, an Hungary-water bottle filled\nwith cherry-brandy, recommending it as a much more powerful remedy than\nthe sal-volatile which the other held to her nose.\n\nPeace being thus re-established, in a treaty comprehending Obadiah and\nall present, it will not be improper to give the reader some further\ninformation, touching the several characters assembled in this vehicle.\nThe quaker was a London merchant, who had been at Deal superintending\nthe repairs of a ship which had suffered by a storm in the Downs. The\nWapping landlady was on her return from the same place, where she had\nattended the payment of a man-of-war, with sundry powers of attorney,\ngranted by the sailors, who had lived upon credit at her house. Her\ncompetitor in fame was a dealer in wine, a smuggler of French lace, and\na petty gamester just arrived from Paris, in the company of an English\nbarber, who sat on his right hand, and the young woman was daughter of\na country curate, in her way to London, where she was bound apprentice\nto a milliner.\n\nHitherto Fathom had sat in silent astonishment at the manners of his\nfellow-travellers, which far exceeded the notions he had preconceived\nof English plainness and rusticity. He found himself a monument of that\ndisregard and contempt which a stranger never fails to meet with from\nthe inhabitants of this island; and saw, with surprise, an agreeable\nyoung creature sit as solitary and unheeded as himself.\n\nHe was, indeed, allured by the roses of her complexion, and the\ninnocence of her aspect, and began to repent of having pretended\nignorance of the language, by which he was restrained from exercising\nhis eloquence upon her heart; he resolved, however, to ingratiate\nhimself, if possible, by the courtesy and politeness of dumb show, and\nfor that purpose put his eyes in motion without farther delay.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\n\nANOTHER PROVIDENTIAL DELIVERANCE FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE SMUGGLER’S\nINGENIOUS CONJECTURE.\n\nDuring these deliberations, the wine merchant, with a view to make a\nparade of his superior parts and breeding, as well as to pave the way\nfor a match at backgammon, made a tender of his snuff-box to our\nadventurer, and asked, in bad French, how he travelled from Paris. This\nquestion produced a series of interrogations concerning the place of\nFerdinand’s abode in that city, and his business in England, so that he\nwas fain to practise the science of defence, and answered with such\nambiguity, as aroused the suspicion of the smuggler, who began to\nbelieve our hero had some very cogent reason for evading his curiosity;\nhe immediately set his reflection at work, and, after various\nconjectures, fixed upon Fathom’s being the Young Pretender. Big with\nthis supposition, he eyed him with the most earnest attention,\ncomparing his features with those of the Chevalier’s portrait which he\nhad seen in France, and though the faces were as unlike as any two\nhuman faces could be, found the resemblance so striking as to dispel\nall his doubts, and persuade him to introduce the stranger to some\njustice on the road; a step by which he would not only manifest his\nzeal for the Protestant succession, but also acquire the splendid\nreward proposed by parliament to any person who should apprehend that\nfamous adventurer.\n\nThese ideas intoxicated the brain of this man to such a pitch of\nenthusiasm, that he actually believed himself in possession of the\nthirty thousand pounds, and amused his fancy with a variety of\nmagnificent projects to be executed by means of that acquisition, until\nhis reverie was interrupted by the halting of the coach at the inn\nwhere the passengers used to eat their breakfasts. Waked as he was from\nthe dream of happiness, it had made such impression upon his mind,\nthat, seeing Fathom rise up with an intention to alight, he took it for\ngranted his design was to escape, and seizing him by the collar, called\naloud for assistance in the King’s name.\n\nOur hero, whose sagacity and presence of mind very often supplied the\nplace of courage, instead of being terrified at this assault, which\nmight have disturbed the tranquillity of an ordinary villain, was so\nperfectly master of every circumstance of his own situation, as to know\nat once that the aggressor could not possibly have the least cause of\ncomplaint against him; and therefore, imputing this violence either to\nmadness or mistake, very deliberately suffered himself to be made\nprisoner by the people of the house, who ran to the coach door in\nobedience to the summons of the wine merchant. The rest of the company\nwere struck dumb with surprise and consternation at this sudden\nadventure; and the quaker, dreading some fell resistance on the side of\nthe outlandish man, unpinned the other coach door in the twinkling of\nan eye, and trundled himself into the mud for safety. The others,\nseeing the temper and resignation of the prisoner, soon recovered their\nrecollection, and began to inquire into the cause of his arrest, upon\nwhich, the captor, whose teeth chattered with terror and impatience,\ngave them to understand that he was a state criminal, and demanded\ntheir help in conveying him to justice.\n\nLuckily for both parties, there happened to be at the inn a company of\nsquires just returned from the death of a leash of hares, which they\nhad ordered to be dressed for dinner, and among these gentlemen was one\nof the quorum, to whom the accuser had immediate recourse, marching\nbefore the captive, who walked very peaceably between the landlord and\none of his waiters, and followed by a crowd of spectators, some of whom\nhad secured the faithful Maurice, who in his behaviour closely imitated\nthe deliberation of his master. In this order did the procession\nadvance to the apartment in which the magistrate, with his fellows of\nthe chase, sat smoking his morning pipe over a tankard of strong ale,\nand the smuggler being directed to the right person, “May it please\nyour worship,” said he, “I have brought this foreigner before you, on a\nviolent suspicion of his being a proclaimed outlaw; and I desire,\nbefore these witnesses, that my title may be made good to the reward\nthat shall become due upon his conviction.”\n\n“Friend,” replied the justice, “I know nothing of you or your titles;\nbut this I know, if you have any information to give in, you must come\nto my house when I am at home, and proceed in a lawful way, that is,\nd’ye mind me, if you swear as how this here person is an outlaw; then\nif so be as he has nothing to say to the contrary, my clerk shall make\nout a mittimus, and so to jail with him till next ’size.” “But, sir,”\nanswered the impeacher, “this is a case that admits of no delay; the\nperson I have apprehended is a prisoner of consequence to the state.”\n“How, fellor!” cried the magistrate, interrupting him, “is there any\nperson of more consequence than one of his Majesty’s justices of the\npeace, who is besides a considerable member of the landed interest!\nD’ye know, sirrah, who you are talking to? If you don’t go about your\nbusiness, I believe I shall lay you by the heels.”\n\nThe smuggler, fearing his prize would escape through the ignorance,\npride, and obstinacy of this country justice, approached his worship,\nand in a whisper which was overheard by all the company, assured him he\nhad indubitable reason to believe the foreigner was no other than the\nPretender’s eldest son. At mention of this formidable name, every\nindividual of the audience started, with signs of terror and amazement.\nThe justice dropped his pipe, recoiled upon his chair, and, looking\nmost ridiculously aghast, exclaimed, “Seize him, in the name of God and\nhis Majesty King George! Has he got no secret arms about him!”\n\nFathom being thus informed of the suspicion under which he stood, could\nnot help smiling at the eagerness with which the spectators flew upon\nhim, and suffered himself to be searched with great composure, well\nknowing they would find no moveables about his person, but such as upon\nexamination would turn to his account; he therefore very calmly\npresented to the magistrate his purse, and a small box that contained\nhis jewels, and in the French language desired they might be preserved\nfrom the hands of the mob. This request was interpreted by the accuser,\nwho, at the same time, laid claim to the booty. The justice took charge\nof the deposit, and one of his neighbours having undertaken the office\nof clerk, he proceeded to the examination of the culprit, whose papers\nwere by this time laid on the table before him. “Stranger,” said he,\n“you stand charged with being son of the Pretender to these realms;\nwhat have you to say in your own defence?” Our hero assured him, in the\nFrench language, that he was falsely impeached, and demanded justice on\nthe accuser, who, without the least reason, had made such a malicious\nattack upon the life and honour of an innocent gentleman.\n\nThe smuggler, instead of acting the part of a faithful interpreter,\ntold his worship, that the prisoner’s answer was no more than a simple\ndenial, which every felon would make who had nothing else to plead in\nhis own behalf, and that this alone was a strong presumption of his\nguilt, because, if he was not really the person they suspected him to\nbe, the thing would speak for itself, for, if he was not the Young\nPretender, who then was he? This argument had great weight with the\njustice, who, assuming a very important aspect, observed, “Very true,\nfriend, if you are not the Pretender, in the name of God, who are you?\nOne may see with half an eye that he is no better than a promiscuous\nfellow.”\n\nFerdinand now began to repent of having pretended ignorance of the\nEnglish language, as he found himself at the mercy of a rascal, who put\na false gloss upon all his words, and addressed himself to the audience\nsuccessively in French, High Dutch, Italian, and Hungarian Latin,\ndesiring to know if any person present understood any of these tongues,\nthat his answers might be honestly explained to the bench. But he might\nhave accosted them in Chinese with the same success: there was not one\nperson present tolerably versed in his mother-tongue, much less\nacquainted with any foreign language, except the wine merchant, who,\nincensed at this appeal, which he considered as an affront to his\nintegrity, gave the judge to understand, that the delinquent, instead\nof speaking to the purpose, contumaciously insulted his authority in\nsundry foreign lingos, which he apprehended was an additional proof of\nhis being the Chevalier’s son, inasmuch as no person would take the\npains to learn such a variety of gibberish, except with some sinister\nintent.\n\nThis annotation was not lost upon the squire, who was too jealous of\nthe honour of his office to overlook such a flagrant instance of\ncontempt. His eyes glistened, his cheeks were inflated with rage. “The\ncase is plain,” said he; “having nothing of signification to offer in\nhis own favour, he grows refractory, and abuses the court in his base\nRoman Catholic jargon; but I’ll let you know, for all you pretend to be\na prince, you are no better than an outlawed vagrant, and I’ll show you\nwhat a thing you are when you come in composition with an English\njustice, like me, who have more than once extinguished myself in the\nservice of my country. As nothing else accrues, your purse, black box,\nand papers shall be sealed up before witnesses, and sent by express to\none of his Majesty’s secretaries of state; and, as for yourself, I will\napply to the military at Canterbury, for a guard to conduct you to\nLondon.”\n\nThis was a very unwelcome declaration to our adventurer, who was on the\npoint of haranguing the justice and spectators in their own language,\nwhen he was relieved from the necessity of taking that step by the\ninterposition of a young nobleman just arrived at the inn, who, being\ninformed of this strange examination, entered the court, and, at first\nsight of the prisoner, assured the justice he was imposed upon; for\nthat he himself had often seen the Young Pretender in Paris, and that\nthere was no kind of resemblance between that adventurer and the person\nnow before him. The accuser was not a little mortified at his\nlordship’s affirmation, which met with all due regard from the bench,\nthough the magistrate took notice, that, granting the prisoner was not\nthe Young Chevalier himself, it was highly probable he was an emissary\nof that house, as he could give no satisfactory account of himself, and\nwas possessed of things of such value as no honest man could expose to\nthe accidents of the road.\n\nFathom, having thus found an interpreter, who signified to him, in the\nFrench tongue, the doubts of the justice, told his lordship, that he\nwas a gentleman of a noble house in Germany, who, for certain reasons,\nhad come abroad incognito, with a view to see the world; and that,\nalthough the letters they had seized would prove the truth of that\nassertion, he should be loth to expose his private concerns to the\nknowledge of strangers, if he could possibly be released without that\nmortification. The young nobleman explained his desire to the court;\nbut, his own curiosity being interested, observed, at the same time,\nthat the justice could not be said to have discharged the duties of his\nstation, until he should have examined every circumstance relating to\nthe prisoner. Upon which remonstrance, he was requested by the bench to\nperuse the papers, and accordingly communicated the substance of one\nletter to this effect:—\n\n“MY DEAR SON,\nThough I am far from approving the rash step you have taken in\nwithdrawing yourself from your father’s house, in order to avoid an\nengagement which would have been equally honourable and advantageous to\nyour family, I cannot so far suppress my affection, as to bear the\nthought of your undergoing those hardships which, for your\ndisobedience, you deserve to suffer. I have therefore, without the\nknowledge of your father, sent the bearer to attend you in your\nperegrinations; his fidelity you know hath been tried in a long course\nof service, and I have entrusted to his care, for your use, a purse of\ntwo hundred ducats, and a box of jewels to the value of twice that sum,\nwhich, though not sufficient to support an equipage suitable to your\nbirth, will, at least for some time, preserve you from the\nimportunities of want. When you are dutiful enough to explain your\ndesigns and situation, you may expect further indulgence from your\ntender and disconsolate mother,—\n\nTHE COUNTESS OF FATHOM.”\n\nThis letter, which, as well as the others, our hero had forged for the\npurpose, effectually answered his intent, in throwing dust in the eyes\nand understanding of the spectators, who now regarded the prisoner with\nlooks of respectful remorse, as a man of quality who had been falsely\naccused. His lordship, to make a parade of his own politeness and\nimportance, assured the bench, he was no stranger to the family of the\nFathoms, and, with a compliment, gave Ferdinand to understand he had\nformerly seen him at Versailles. There being no longer room for\nsuspicion, the justice ordered our adventurer to be set at liberty, and\neven invited him to be seated, with an apology for the rude manner in\nwhich he had been treated, owing to the misinformation of the accuser,\nwho was threatened with the stocks, for his malice and presumption.\n\nBut this was not the only triumph our hero obtained over the wine\nmerchant. Maurice was no sooner unfettered, than, advancing into the\nmiddle of the room, “My lord,” said he, addressing himself in French to\nhis master’s deliverer, “since you have been so generous as to protect\na noble stranger from the danger of such a false accusation, I hope you\nwill still lay an additional obligation upon the Count, by retorting\nthe vengeance of the law upon his perfidious accuser, whom I know to be\na trader in those articles of merchandise which are prohibited by the\nordinances of this nation. I have seen him lately at Boulogne, and am\nperfectly well acquainted with some persons who have supplied him with\nFrench lace and embroidery; and, as a proof of what I allege, I desire\nyou will order him and this barber, who is his understrapper, to be\nexamined on the spot.”\n\nThis charge, which was immediately explained to the bench, yielded\nextraordinary satisfaction to the spectators, one of whom, being an\nofficer of the customs, forthwith began to exercise his function upon\nthe unlucky perruquier, who, being stripped of his upper garments, and\neven of his shirt, appeared like the mummy of an Egyptian king, most\ncuriously rolled up in bandages of rich figured gold shalloon, that\ncovered the skirts of four embroidered waistcoats. The merchant, seeing\nhis expectation so unhappily reversed, made an effort to retire with a\nmost rueful aspect, but was prevented by the officer, who demanded the\ninterposition of the civil power, that he might undergo the same\nexamination to which the other had been subjected. He was accordingly\nrifled without loss of time, and the inquiry proved well worth the care\nof him who made it; for a considerable booty of the same sort of\nmerchandise was found in his boots, breeches, hat, and between the\nbuckram and lining of his surtout. Yet, not contented with this prize,\nthe experienced spoiler proceeded to search his baggage, and,\nperceiving a false bottom in his portmanteau, detected beneath it a\nvaluable accession to the plunder he had already obtained.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY\n\nTHE SINGULAR MANNER OF FATHOM’S ATTACK AND TRIUMPH OVER THE VIRTUE OF\nTHE FAIR ELENOR.\n\nProper cognisance being thus taken of these contraband effects, and the\ninformer furnished with a certificate, by which he was entitled to a\nshare of the seizure, the coachman summoned his passengers to the\ncarriage; the purse and jewels were restored to Count Fathom, who\nthanked the justice, and his lordship in particular, for the candour\nand hospitality with which he had been treated, and resumed his place\nin the vehicle, amidst the congratulations of all his\nfellow-travellers, except the two forlorn smugglers, who, instead of\nre-embarking in the coach, thought proper to remain at the inn, with\nview to mitigate, if possible, the severity of their misfortune.\n\nAmong those who felicitated Fathom upon the issue of this adventure,\nthe young maiden seemed to express the most sensible pleasure at that\nevent. The artful language of his eyes had raised in her breast certain\nfluttering emotions, before she knew the value of her conquest; but now\nthat his rank and condition were discovered, these transports were\nincreased by the ideas of vanity and ambition, which are mingled with\nthe first seeds of every female constitution. The belief of having\ncaptivated the heart of a man who could raise her to the rank and\ndignity of a countess, produced such agreeable sensations in her fancy,\nthat her eyes shone with unusual lustre, and a continual smile played\nin dimples on her rosy cheeks; so that her attractions, though not\npowerful enough to engage the affection, were yet sufficient to inflame\nthe desire of our adventurer, who very honestly marked her chastity for\nprey to his voluptuous passion. Had she been well seasoned with\nknowledge and experience, and completely armed with caution against the\nartifice and villany of man, her virtue might not have been able to\nwithstand the engines of such an assailant, considering the dangerous\nopportunities to which she was necessarily exposed. How easy then must\nhis victory have been over an innocent, unsuspecting country damsel,\nflushed with the warmth of youth, and an utter stranger to the ways of\nlife!\n\nWhile Obadiah, therefore, and his plump companion, were engaged in\nconversation, on the strange incidents which had passed, Fathom acted a\nvery expressive pantomime with this fair buxom nymph, who comprehended\nhis meaning with surprising facility, and was at so little pains to\nconceal the pleasure she took in this kind of intercourse, that several\nwarm squeezes were interchanged between her and her lover, before they\narrived at Rochester, where they proposed to dine. It was during this\nperiod, he learned from the answers she made to the inquisitive quaker,\nthat her sole dependence was upon a relation, to whom she had a letter,\nand that she was a perfect stranger in the great city; circumstances on\nwhich he soon formed the project of her ruin.\n\nUpon their arrival at the Black Bull, he for the first time found\nhimself alone with his Amanda, whose name was Elenor, their\nfellow-travellers being elsewhere employed about their own concerns;\nand, unwilling to lose the precious opportunity, he began to act the\npart of a very importunate lover, which he conceived to be a proper\nsequel to the prelude which had been performed in the coach. The\nfreedoms which she, out of pure simplicity and good-humour, permitted\nhim to take with her hand, and even her rosy lips, encouraged him to\npractise other familiarities upon her fair bosom, which scandalised her\nvirtue so much, that, in spite of the passion she had begun to indulge\nin his behalf, she rejected his advances with all the marks of anger\nand disdain; and he found it necessary to appease the storm he had\nraised, by the most respectful and submissive demeanour; resolving to\nchange his operations, and carry on his attacks, so as to make her\nyield at discretion, without alarming her religion or pride.\nAccordingly, when the bill was called after dinner, he took particular\nnotice of her behaviour, and, perceiving her pull out a large leathern\npurse that contained her money, reconnoitred the pocket in which it was\ndeposited, and, while they sat close to each other in the carriage,\nconveyed it with admirable dexterity into an hole in the cushion.\nWhether the corpulent couple, who sat opposite to these lovers, had\nentered into an amorous engagement at the inn, or were severally\ninduced by other motives, is uncertain; but sure it is, both left the\ncoach on that part of the road which lies nearest to Gravesend, and\nbade adieu to the other pair, on pretence of having urgent business at\nthat place.\n\nFerdinand, not a little pleased at their departure, renewed his most\npathetic expressions of love, and sung several French songs on that\ntender subject, which seemed to thrill to the soul of his beauteous\nHelen. While the driver halted at Dartford to water his horses, she was\nsmit with the appearance of some cheesecakes, which were presented by\nthe landlady of the house, and having bargained for two or three, put\nher hand in her pocket, in order to pay for her purchase; but what was\nher astonishment, when, after having rummaged her equipage, she\nunderstood her whole fortune was lost! This mishap was, by a loud\nshriek, announced to our hero, who affected infinite amazement and\nconcern; and no sooner learned the cause of her affliction, than he\npresented her with his own purse, from which he, in emphatic dumb show,\nbegged she would indemnify herself for the damage she had sustained.\nAlthough this kind proffer was some alleviation of her misfortunes, she\ndid not fail to pour forth a most piteous lamentation, importing that\nshe had not only lost all her money, amounting to five pounds, but also\nher letter of recommendation, upon which she had altogether relied for\npresent employment.\n\nThe vehicle was minutely searched from top to bottom, by herself and\nour adventurer, assisted by Maurice and the coachman, who, finding\ntheir inquiry ineffectual, did not scruple to declare his suspicion of\nthe two fat turtles who had deserted the coach in such an abrupt\nmanner. In a word, he rendered this conjecture so plausible, by\nwresting the circumstances of their behaviour and retreat, that poor\nElenor implicitly believed they were the thieves by whom she had\nsuffered; and was prevailed upon to accept the proffered assistance of\nthe generous Count, who, seeing her very much disordered by this\nmischance, insisted upon her drinking a large glass of canary, to quiet\nthe perturbation of her spirits. This is a season, which of all others\nis most propitious to the attempts of an artful lover; and justifies\nthe metaphorical maxim of fishing in troubled waters. There is an\naffinity and short transition betwixt all the violent passions that\nagitate the human mind. They are all false perspectives, which, though\nthey magnify, yet perplex and render indistinct every object which they\nrepresent. And flattery is never so successfully administered, as to\nthose who know they stand in need of friendship, assent, and\napprobation.\n\nThe cordial she swallowed, far from calming, increased the disturbance\nof her thoughts, and produced an intoxication; during which, she talked\nin an incoherent strain, laughed and wept by turns, and acted other\nextravagances, which are known to be symptoms of the hysterical\naffection. Fathom, though an utter stranger to the sentiments of\nhonour, pity, and remorse, would not perpetrate his vicious purpose,\nthough favoured by the delirium his villany had entailed upon this\nunfortunate young maiden; because his appetite demanded a more perfect\nsacrifice than that which she could yield in her present deplorable\nsituation, when her will must have been altogether unconcerned in his\nsuccess. Determined, therefore, to make a conquest of her virtue,\nbefore he would take possession of her person, he mimicked that\ncompassion and benevolence which his heart had never felt, and, when\nthe coach arrived at London, not only discharged what she owed for her\nplace, but likewise procured for her an apartment in the house to which\nhe himself had been directed for lodgings, and even hired a nurse to\nattend her during a severe fever, which was the consequence of her\ndisappointment and despondence. Indeed, she was supplied with all\nnecessaries by the generosity of this noble Count, who, for the\ninterest of his passion, and the honour of his name, was resolved to\nextend his charity to the last farthing of her own money, which he had\nbeen wise enough to secure for this purpose.\n\nHer youth soon got the better of her distemper, and when she understood\nher obligations to the Count, who did not fail to attend her in person\nwith great tenderness, her heart, which had been before prepossessed in\nhis favour, now glowed with all the warmth of gratitude, esteem, and\naffection. She knew herself in a strange place, destitute of all\nresource but in his generosity. She loved his person, she was dazzled\nby his rank; and he knew so well how to improve the opportunities and\nadvantages he derived from her unhappy situation, that he gradually\nproceeded in sapping from one degree of intimacy to another, until all\nthe bulwarks of her chastity were undermined, and she submitted to his\ndesire; not with the reluctance of a vanquished people, but with all\nthe transports of a joyful city, that opens its gates to receive a\ndarling prince returned from conquest. For by this time he had artfully\nconcentred and kindled up all the inflammable ingredients of her\nconstitution; and she now looked back upon the virtuous principles of\nher education, as upon a disagreeable and tedious dream, from which she\nhad waked to the fruition of never-fading joy.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\n\nHE BY ACCIDENT ENCOUNTERS HIS OLD FRIEND, WITH WHOM HE HOLDS A\nCONFERENCE, AND RENEWS A TREATY.\n\nOur hero, having thus provided himself with a proper subject for his\nhours of dalliance, thought it was now high time to study the ground\nwhich he had pitched upon for the scene of his exploits, and with that\nview made several excursions to different parts of the town, where\nthere was aught of entertainment or instruction to be found. Yet he\nalways, on these occasions, appeared in an obscure ordinary dress, in\norder to avoid singularity, and never went twice to the same\ncoffee-house, that his person might not be afterwards known, in case he\nshould shine forth to the public in a superior sphere. On his return\nfrom one of those expeditions, while he was passing through Ludgate,\nhis eyes were suddenly encountered by the apparition of his old friend\nthe Tyrolese, who, perceiving himself fairly caught in the toil, made a\nvirtue of necessity, and, running up to our adventurer with an aspect\nof eagerness and joy, clasped him in his arms, as some dear friend,\nwhom he had casually found after a most tedious and disagreeable\nseparation.\n\nFathom, whose genius never failed him in such emergencies, far from\nreceiving these advances with the threats and reproaches which the\nother had deserved at his hands, returned the salute with equal warmth,\nand was really overjoyed at meeting with a person who might one way or\nother make amends for the perfidy of his former conduct. The Tyrolese,\nwhose name was Ratchcali, pleased with his reception, proposed they\nshould adjourn to the next tavern, in which they had no sooner taken\npossession of an apartment, than he addressed himself to his old\ncompanion in these words:—\n\n“Mr. Fathom, by your frank and obliging manner of treating a man who\nhath done you wrong, I am more and more confirmed in my opinion of your\nsagacity, which I have often considered with admiration; I will not\ntherefore attempt to make an apology for my conduct at our last\nparting; but only assure you that this meeting may turn out to our\nmutual advantage, if we now re-enter into an unreserved union, the ties\nof which we will soon find it our interest and inclination to preserve.\nFor my own part, as my judgment is ripened by experience, so are my\nsentiments changed since our last association. I have seen many a rich\nharvest lost, for want of a fellow-labourer in the vineyard; and I have\nmore than once fallen a sacrifice to a combination, which I could have\nresisted with the help of one able auxiliary. Indeed, I might prove\nwhat I allege by mathematical demonstration; and I believe nobody will\npretend to deny, that two heads are better than one, in all cases that\nrequire discernment and deliberation.”\n\nFerdinand could not help owning the sanity of his observations, and\nforthwith acquiesced in his proposal of the new alliance; desiring to\nknow the character in which he acted on the English stage, and the\nscheme he would offer for their mutual emolument. At the same time he\nresolved within himself to keep such a strict eye over his future\nactions, as would frustrate any design he might hereafter harbour, of\nrepeating the prank he had so successfully played upon him, in their\njourney from the banks of the Rhine.\n\n“Having quitted you at Bar-le-duc,” resumed the Tyrolese, “I travelled\nwithout ceasing, until I arrived at Frankfort upon the Maine, where I\nassumed the character of a French chevalier, and struck some masterly\nstrokes, which you yourself would not have deemed unworthy of your\ninvention; and my success was the more agreeable, as my operations were\nchiefly carried on against the enemies of our religion. But my\nprosperity was not of long duration. Seeing they could not foil me at\nmy own weapons, they formed a damned conspiracy, by which I not only\nlost all the fruits of my industry, but likewise ran the most imminent\nhazard of my life. I had ordered some of those jewels which I had\nborrowed of my good friend Fathom to be new set in a fashionable taste,\nand soon after had an opportunity to sell one of these, at a great\nadvantage, to one of the fraternity, who offered an extraordinary price\nfor the stone, on purpose to effect my ruin. In less than\nfour-and-twenty hours after this bargain, I was arrested by the\nofficers of justice upon the oath of the purchaser, who undertook to\nprove me guilty of a fraud, in selling a Saxon pebble for a real\ndiamond; and this accusation was actually true; for the change had been\nartfully put upon me by the jeweller, who was himself engaged in the\nconspiracy.\n\n“Had my conscience been clear of any other impeachment, perhaps I\nshould have rested my cause upon the equity and protection of the law;\nbut I foresaw that the trial would introduce an inquiry, to which I was\nnot at all ambitious of submitting, and therefore was fain to\ncompromise the affair, at the price of almost my whole fortune. Yet\nthis accommodation was not made so secretly, but that my character was\nblasted, and my credit overthrown; so that I was fain to relinquish my\noccasional equipage, and hire myself as journeyman to a lapidary, an\nemployment which I had exercised in my youth. In this obscure station,\nI laboured with great assiduity, until I made myself perfect in the\nknowledge of stones, as well as in the different methods of setting\nthem off to the best advantage; and having, by dint of industry and\naddress, got possession of a small parcel, set out for this kingdom, in\nwhich I happily arrived about four months ago; and surely England is\nthe paradise of artists of our profession.\n\n“One would imagine that nature had created the inhabitants for the\nsupport and enjoyment of adventurers like you and me. Not that these\nislanders open the arms of hospitality to all foreigners without\ndistinction. On the contrary, they inherit from their fathers an\nunreasonable prejudice against all nations under the sun; and when an\nEnglishman happens to quarrel with a stranger, the first term of\nreproach he uses is the name of his antagonist’s country, characterised\nby some opprobrious epithet, such as a chattering Frenchman, an Italian\nape, a German hog, and a beastly Dutchman; nay, their national\nprepossession is maintained even against those people with whom they\nare united under the same laws and government; for nothing is more\ncommon than to hear them exclaim against their fellow-subjects, in the\nexpressions of a beggarly Scot, and an impudent Irish bog-trotter. Yet\nthis very prejudice will never fail to turn to the account of every\nstranger possessed of ordinary talents; for he will always find\nopportunities of conversing with them in coffee-houses and places of\npublic resort, in spite of their professed reserve, which, by the bye,\nis so extraordinary, that I know some people who have lived twenty\nyears in the same house without exchanging one word with their\nnext-door neighbours; yet, provided he can talk sensibly, and preserve\nthe deportment of a sober gentleman, in those occasional conversations,\nhis behaviour will be the more remarkably pleasing, as it will\nagreeably disappoint the expectation of the person who had entertained\nnotions to his prejudice. When a foreigner has once crossed this bar,\nwhich perpetually occurs, he sails without further difficulty into the\nharbour of an Englishman’s goodwill; for the pique is neither personal\nnor rancorous, but rather contemptuous and national; so that, while he\ndespises a people in the lump, an individual of that very community may\nbe one of his chief favourites.\n\n“The English are in general upright and honest, therefore unsuspecting\nand credulous. They are too much engrossed with their own business to\npry into the conduct of their neighbours, and too indifferent, in point\nof disposition, to interest themselves in what they conceive to be\nforeign to their own concerns. They are wealthy and mercantile, of\nconsequence liberal and adventurous, and so well disposed to take a\nman’s own word for his importance, that they suffer themselves to be\npreyed upon by such a bungling set of impostors, as would starve for\nlack of address in any other country under the sun. This being a true\nsketch of the British character, so far as I have been able to observe\nand learn, you will easily comprehend the profits that may be extracted\nfrom it, by virtue of those arts by which you so eminently excel;—the\ngreat, the unbounded prospect lies before me! Indeed, I look upon this\nopulent kingdom as a wide and fertile common, on which we adventurers\nmay range for prey, without let or molestation. For so jealous are the\nnatives of their liberties, that they will not bear the restraint of\nnecessary police, and an able artist may enrich himself with their\nspoils, without running any risk of attracting the magistrate, or\nincurring the least penalty of the law.\n\n“In a word, this metropolis is a vast masquerade, in which a man of\nstratagem may wear a thousand different disguises, without danger of\ndetection. There is a variety of shapes in which we the knights of\nindustry make our appearance in London. One glides into a nobleman’s\nhouse in the capacity of a valet-de-chambre, and in a few months leads\nthe whole family by the nose. Another exhibits himself to the public,\nas an empiric or operator for the teeth; and by dint of assurance and\naffidavits, bearing testimony to wonderful cures that never were\nperformed, whirls himself into his chariot, and lays the town under\ncontribution. A third professes the composition of music, as well as\nthe performance, and by means of a few capriciosos on the violin,\nproperly introduced, wriggles himself into the management of private\nand public concerts. And a fourth breaks forth at once in all the\nsplendour of a gay equipage, under the title and denomination of a\nforeign count. Not to mention those inferior projectors, who assume the\ncharacters of dancers, fencing-masters, and French ushers, or, by\nrenouncing their religion, seek to obtain a provision for life.\n\n“Either of these parts will turn to the account of an able actor; and,\nas you are equally qualified for all, you may choose that which is most\nsuitable to your own inclination. Though, in my opinion, you was\ndesigned by nature to shine in the great world, which, after all, is\nthe most ample field for men of genius; because the game is deeper, and\npeople of fashion being, for the most part, more ignorant, indolent,\nvain, and capricious, than their inferiors, are of consequence more\neasily deceived; besides, their morals sit generally so loose about\nthem, that, when a gentleman of our fraternity is discovered in the\nexercise of his profession, their contempt of his skill is the only\ndisgrace he incurs.”\n\nOur hero was so well pleased with this picture, that he longed to\nperuse the original, and, before these two friends parted, they settled\nall the operations of the campaign. Ratchcali, that same evening, hired\nmagnificent lodgings for Count Fathom, in the court end of the town,\nand furnished his wardrobe and liveries from the spoils of Monmouth\nStreet; he likewise enlisted another footman and valet-de-chambre into\nhis service, and sent to the apartments divers large trunks, supposed\nto be filled with the baggage of this foreign nobleman, though, in\nreality, they contained little else than common lumber.\n\nNext day, our adventurer took possession of his new habitation, after\nhaving left to his friend and associate the task of dismissing the\nunfortunate Elenor, who was so shocked at the unexpected message, that\nshe fainted away; and when she recovered the use of her senses so well\nas to reflect upon her forlorn condition, she was seized with the most\nviolent transports of grief and dismay, by which her brain was\ndisordered to such a degree, that she grew furious and distracted, and\nwas, by the advice and assistance of the Tyrolese, conveyed into the\nhospital of Bethlem; where we shall leave her for the present, happily\nbereft of her reason.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\n\nHE APPEARS IN THE GREAT WORLD WITH UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE AND ADMIRATION.\n\nMeanwhile, Fathom and his engine were busied in completing his\nequipage, so that in a few days he had procured a very gay chariot,\nadorned with painting, gilding, and a coat of arms, according to his\nown fancy and direction. The first use he made of this vehicle was that\nof visiting the young nobleman from whom he had received such important\ncivilities on the road, in consequence of an invitation at parting, by\nwhich he learned his title and the place of his abode in London.\n\nHis lordship was not only pleased, but proud to see such a stranger at\nhis gate, and entertained him with excess of complaisance and\nhospitality; insomuch that, by his means, our hero soon became\nacquainted with the whole circle of polite company, by whom he was\ncaressed for his insinuating manners and agreeable conversation. He had\nthought proper to tell the nobleman, at their first interview in town,\nthat his reasons for concealing his knowledge of the English tongue\nwere now removed, and that he would no longer deny himself the pleasure\nof speaking a language which had been always music to his ear. He had\nalso thanked his lordship for his generous interposition at the inn,\nwhich was an instance of that generosity and true politeness which are\nengrossed by the English people, who leave nought to other nations but\nthe mere shadow of these virtues.\n\nA testimony like this, from the mouth of such a noble stranger, won the\nheart of the peer, who professed a friendship for him on the spot, and\nundertook to see justice done to his lacquey, who in a short time was\ngratified with a share of the seizure which had been made upon his\ninformation, amounting to fifty or sixty pounds.\n\nFerdinand put not forth the whole strength of his accomplishments at\nonce, but contrived to spring a new mine of qualification every day, to\nthe surprise and admiration of all his acquaintance. He was gifted with\na sort of elocution, much more specious than solid, and spoke on every\nsubject that occurred in conversation with that familiarity and ease,\nwhich, one would think, could only be acquired by long study and\napplication. This plausibility and confidence are faculties really\ninherited from nature, and effectually serve the possessor, in lieu of\nthat learning which is not to be obtained without infinite toil and\nperseverance. The most superficial tincture of the arts and sciences in\nsuch a juggler, is sufficient to dazzle the understanding of half\nmankind; and, if managed with circumspection, will enable him even to\nspend his life among the literati, without once forfeiting the\ncharacter of a connoisseur.\n\nOur hero was perfectly master of this legerdemain, which he carried to\nsuch a pitch of assurance, as to declare, in the midst of a\nmathematical assembly, that he intended to gratify the public with a\nfull confutation of Sir Isaac Newton’s philosophy, to the nature of\nwhich he was as much a stranger as the most savage Hottentot in Africa.\nHis pretensions to profound and universal knowledge were supported not\nonly by this kind of presumption, but also by the facility with which\nhe spoke so many different languages, and the shrewd remarks he had\nmade in the course of his travels and observation.\n\nAmong politicians, he settled the balance of power upon a certain\nfooting, by dint of ingenious schemes, which he had contrived for the\nwelfare of Europe. With officers, he reformed the art of war, with\nimprovements which had occurred to his reflection while he was engaged\nin a military life. He sometimes held forth upon painting, like a\nmember of the Dilettanti club. The theory of music was a theme upon\nwhich he seemed to expatiate with particular pleasure. In the provinces\nof love and gallantry, he was a perfect Oroondates. He possessed a most\nagreeable manner of telling entertaining stories, of which he had a\nlarge collection; he sung with great melody and taste, and played upon\nthe violin with surprising execution. To these qualifications let us\nadd his affability and pliant disposition, and then the reader will not\nwonder that he was looked upon as the pattern of human perfection, and\nhis acquaintance courted accordingly.\n\nWhile he thus captivated the favour and affection of the English\nnobility, he did not neglect to take other measures in behalf of the\npartnership to which he had subscribed. The adventure with the two\nsquires at Paris had weakened his appetite for play, which was not at\nall restored by the observations he had made in London, where the art\nof gaming is reduced into a regular system, and its professors so\nlaudably devoted to the discharge of their functions, as to observe the\nmost temperate regimen, lest their invention should be impaired by the\nfatigue of watching or exercise, and their ideas disturbed by the fumes\nof indigestion. No Indian Brachman could live more abstemious than two\nof the pack, who hunted in couple, and kennelled in the upper\napartments of the hotel in which our adventurer lived. They abstained\nfrom animal food with the abhorrence of Pythagoreans, their drink was a\npure simple element, they were vomited once a week, took physic or a\nglyster every third day, spent the forenoon in algebraical\ncalculations, and slept from four o’clock till midnight, that they\nmight then take the field with that cool serenity which is the effect\nof refreshment and repose.\n\nThese were terms upon which our hero would not risk his fortune; he was\ntoo much addicted to pleasure to forego every other enjoyment but that\nof amassing; and did not so much depend upon his dexterity in play as\nupon his talent of insinuation, which, by this time, had succeeded so\nfar beyond his expectation, that he began to indulge the hope of\nenslaving the heart of some rich heiress, whose fortune would at once\nraise him above all dependence. Indeed, no man ever set out with a\nfairer prospect on such an expedition; for he had found means to render\nhimself so agreeable to the fair sex, that, like the boxes of the\nplayhouse, during the representation of a new performance, his company\nwas often bespoke for a series of weeks; and no lady, whether widow,\nwife, or maiden, ever mentioned his name, without some epithet of\nesteem or affection; such as the dear Count! the charming Man! the\nNonpareil, or the Angel!\n\nWhile he thus shone in the zenith of admiration, it is not to be\ndoubted, that he could have melted some wealthy dowager or opulent\nward; but, being an enemy to all precipitate engagements, he resolved\nto act with great care and deliberation in an affair of such\nimportance, especially as he did not find himself hurried by the\nimportunities of want; for, since his arrival in England, he had rather\nincreased than exhausted his finances, by methods equally certain and\nsecure. In a word, he, with the assistance of Ratchcali, carried on a\ntraffic, which yielded great profits, without subjecting the trader to\nthe least loss or inconvenience. Fathom, for example, wore upon his\nfinger a large brilliant, which he played to such advantage one night,\nat a certain nobleman’s house, where he was prevailed upon to entertain\nthe company with a solo on the violin, that everybody present took\nnotice of its uncommon lustre, and it was handed about for the perusal\nof every individual. The water and the workmanship were universally\nadmired; and one among the rest having expressed a desire of knowing\nthe value of such a jewel, the Count seized that opportunity of\nentertaining them with a learned disquisition into the nature of\nstones; this introduced the history of the diamond in question, which\nhe said had been purchased of an Indian trader of Fort St. George, at\nan under price; so that the present proprietor could afford to sell it\nat a very reasonable rate; and concluded with telling the company,\nthat, for his own part, he had been importuned to wear it by the\njeweller, who imagined it would have a better chance for attracting a\npurchaser on his finger, than while it remained in his own custody.\n\nThis declaration was no sooner made, than a certain lady of quality\nbespoke the refuse of the jewel, and desired Ferdinand to send the\nowner next day to her house, where he accordingly waited upon her\nladyship with the ring, for which he received one hundred and fifty\nguineas, two-thirds of the sum being clear gain, and equally divided\nbetwixt the associates. Nor was this bargain such as reflected\ndishonour upon the lady’s taste, or could be productive of ill\nconsequences to the merchant; for the method of estimating diamonds is\naltogether arbitrary; and Ratchcali, who was an exquisite lapidary, had\nset it in such a manner as would have imposed upon any ordinary\njeweller. By these means of introduction, the Tyrolese soon monopolised\nthe custom of a great many noble families, upon which he levied large\ncontributions, without incurring the least suspicion of deceit. He\nevery day, out of pure esteem and gratitude for the honour of their\ncommands, entertained them with the sight of some new trinket, which he\nwas never permitted to carry home unsold; and from the profits of each\njob, a tax was raised for the benefit of our adventurer.\n\nYet his indultos were not confined to the article of jewels, which\nconstituted only one part of his revenue. By the industry of his\nunderstrapper, he procured a number of old crazy fiddles, which were\nthrown aside as lumber; upon which he counterfeited the Cremona mark,\nand otherwise cooked them up with great dexterity; so that, when he had\noccasion to regale the lovers of music, he would send for one of these\nvamped instruments, and extract from it such tones as quite ravished\nthe hearers; among whom there was always some conceited pretender, who\nspoke in raptures of the violin, and gave our hero an opportunity of\nlaunching out in its praise, and declaring it was the best Cremona he\nhad ever touched. This encomium never failed to inflame the desires of\nthe audience, to some one of whom he was generous enough to part with\nit at prime cost—that is, for twenty or thirty guineas clear profit;\nfor he was often able to oblige his friends in this manner, because,\nbeing an eminent connoisseur, his countenance was solicited by all the\nmusicians, who wanted to dispose of such moveables.\n\nNor did he neglect the other resources of a skilful virtuoso. Every\nauction afforded some picture, in which, though it had been overlooked\nby the ignorance of the times, he recognised the style of a great\nmaster, and made a merit of recommending it to some noble friend. This\ncommerce he likewise extended to medals, bronzes, busts, intaglios, and\nold china, and kept divers artificers continually employed in making\nantiques for the English nobility. Thus he went on with such rapidity\nof success in all his endeavours, that he himself was astonished at the\ninfatuation he had produced. Nothing was so wretched among the\nproductions of art, that he could not impose upon the world as a\ncapital performance; and so fascinated were the eyes of his admirers,\nhe could easily have persuaded them that a barber’s bason was an\nEtrurian patera, and the cover of a copper pot no other than the shield\nof Ancus Martius. In short, it was become so fashionable to consult the\nCount in everything relating to taste and politeness, that not a plan\nwas drawn, not even a house furnished, without his advice and\napprobation; nay, to such a degree did his reputation in these matters\nexcel, that a particular pattern of paper-hangings was known by the\nname of Fathom; and his hall was every morning crowded with\nupholsterers, and other tradesmen, who came, by order of their\nemployers, to learn his choice, and take his directions.\n\nThe character and influence he thus acquired, he took care to maintain\nwith the utmost assiduity and circumspection. He never failed to appear\nthe chief personage at all public diversions and private assemblies,\nnot only in conversation and dress, but also in the article of dancing,\nin which he outstripped all his fellows, as far as in every other\ngenteel accomplishment.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\n\nHE ATTRACTS THE ENVY AND ILL OFFICES OF THE MINOR KNIGHTS OF HIS OWN\nORDER, OVER WHOM HE OBTAINS A COMPLETE VICTORY.\n\nSuch a pre-eminence could not be enjoyed without exciting the\nmalevolence of envy and detraction, in the propagation of which none\nwere so industrious as the brethren of his own order, who had, like\nhim, made a descent upon this island, and could not, without repining,\nsee the whole harvest in the hands of one man, who, with equal art and\ndiscretion, avoided all intercourse with their society. In vain they\nstrove to discover his pedigree, and detect the particular\ncircumstances of his life and conversation; all their inquiries were\nbaffled by the obscurity of his origin, and that solitary scheme which\nhe had adopted in the beginning of his career. The whole fruit of their\ninvestigation amounted to no more than a certainty that there was no\nfamily of any consideration in Europe known by the denomination of\nFathom; and this discovery they did not fail to divulge for the benefit\nof our adventurer, who had by this time taken such firm root in the\nfavour of the great, as to set all those little arts at defiance; and\nwhen the report reached his ear, actually made his friends merry with\nthe conjectures which had been circulated at his expense.\n\nHis adversaries, finding themselves disappointed in this effort, held a\nconsultation to devise other measures against him, and came to a\nresolution of ending him by the sword, or rather of expelling him from\nthe kingdom by the fear of death, which they hoped he had not courage\nenough to resist, because his deportment had always been remarkably\nmild and pacific. It was upon this supposition that they left to the\ndetermination of the dice the choice of the person who should execute\ntheir plan; and the lot falling upon a Swiss, who, from the station of\na foot soldier in the Dutch service, out of which he had been drummed\nfor theft, had erected himself into the rank of a self-created\nchevalier, this hero fortified himself with a double dose of brandy,\nand betook himself to a certain noted coffee-house, with an intent to\naffront Count Fathom in public.\n\nHe was lucky enough to find our adventurer sitting at a table in\nconversation with some persons of the first rank; upon which he seated\nhimself in the next box, and after having intruded himself into their\ndiscourse, which happened to turn upon the politics of some German\ncourts, “Count,” said he to Ferdinand, in a very abrupt and\ndisagreeable manner of address, “I was last night in company with some\ngentlemen, among whom a dispute happened about the place of your\nnativity; pray, what country are you of?” “Sir,” answered the other,\nwith great politeness, “I at present have the honour to be of England.”\n“Oho!” replied the chevalier, “I ask your pardon, that is to say, you\nare incog; some people may find it convenient to keep themselves in\nthat situation.” “True,” said the Count, “but some people are too well\nknown to enjoy that privilege.” The Swiss being a little disconcerted\nat this repartee, which extracted a smile from the audience, after some\npause, observed, that persons of a certain class had good reason to\ndrop the remembrance of what they have been; but a good citizen will\nnot forget his country, or former condition. “And a bad citizen,” said\nFathom, “cannot, if he would, provided he has met with his deserts; a\nsharper may as well forget the shape of a die, or a discarded soldier\nthe sound of a drum.”\n\nAs the chevalier’s character and story were not unknown, this\napplication raised an universal laugh at his expense, which provoked\nhim to such a degree, that, starting up, he swore Fathom could not have\nmentioned any object in nature that he himself resembled so much as a\ndrum, which was exactly typified by his emptiness and sound, with this\ndifference, however, that a drum was never noisy till beaten, whereas\nthe Count would never be quiet, until he should have undergone the same\ndiscipline. So saying, he laid his hand upon his sword with a menacing\nlook, and walked out as if in expectation of being followed by our\nadventurer, who suffered himself to be detained by the company, and\nvery calmly took notice, that his antagonist would not be ill pleased\nat their interposition. Perhaps he would not have comported himself\nwith such ease and deliberation, had not he made such remarks upon the\ndisposition of the chevalier, as convinced him of his own safety. He\nhad perceived a perplexity and perturbation in the countenance of the\nSwiss, when he first entered the coffee-room; his blunt and precipitate\nway of accosting him seemed to denote confusion and compulsion; and, in\nthe midst of his ferocity, this accurate observer discerned the\ntrepidation of fear. By the help of these signs, his sagacity soon\ncomprehended the nature of his schemes, and prepared accordingly for a\nformal defiance.\n\nHis conjecture was verified next morning by a visit from the chevalier,\nwho, taking it for granted that Fathom would not face an adversary in\nthe field, because he had not followed him from the coffee-house, went\nto his lodgings with great confidence, and demanded to see the Count\nupon an affair that would admit of no delay. Maurice, according to his\ninstructions, told him that his master was gone out, but desired he\nwould have the goodness to repose himself in the parlour, till the\nCount’s return, which he expected every moment. Ferdinand, who had\ntaken post in a proper place for observation, seeing his antagonist\nfairly admitted, took the same road, and appearing before him, wrapped\nup in a long Spanish cloak, desired to know what had procured him the\nhonour of such an early visit. The Swiss, raising his voice to conceal\nhis agitation, explained his errand, in demanding reparation for the\ninjury his honour had sustained the preceding day, in that odious\nallusion to a scandalous report which had been raised by the malice of\nhis enemies; and insisted, in a very imperious style, upon his\nattending him forthwith to the nursery in Hyde Park. “Have a little\npatience,” said our adventurer with great composure, “and I will do\nmyself the pleasure to wait upon you in a few moments.”\n\nWith these words, he rang the bell, and, calling for a bason of water,\nlaid aside his cloak, and displayed himself in his shirt, with a sword\nin his right hand, which was all over besmeared with recent blood, as\nif he had just come from the slaughter of a foe. This phenomenon made\nsuch an impression upon the astonished chevalier, already discomposed\nby the resolute behaviour of the Count, that he became jaundiced with\nterror and dismay, and, while his teeth chattered in his head, told our\nhero he had hoped, from his known politeness, to have found him ready\nto acknowledge an injury which might have been the effect of anger or\nmisapprehension, in which case the affair might have been compromised\nto their mutual satisfaction, without proceeding to those extremities\nwhich, among men of honour, are always accounted the last resource. To\nthis representation Ferdinand answered, that the affair had been of the\nchevalier’s own seeking, inasmuch as he had intruded himself into his\ncompany, and treated him with the most insolent and unprovoked abuse,\nwhich plainly flowed from a premeditated design against his honour and\nreputation; he, therefore, far from being disposed to own himself in\nthe wrong, would not even accept of a public acknowledgment from him,\nthe aggressor, whom he looked upon as an infamous sharper, and was\nresolved to chastise accordingly.\n\nHere the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a person who\nwas brought to the door in a chair, and conducted into another\napartment, from which a message was brought to the Count, importing,\nthat the stranger desired to speak with him upon business of the last\nimportance. Fathom having chid the servant for admitting people without\nhis order, desired the Swiss to excuse him for a minute longer, and\nwent in to the next room, from whence the following dialogue was\noverheard by this challenger:—“Count,” said the stranger, “you are not\nignorant of my pretensions to the heart of that young lady, at whose\nhouse I met you yesterday; therefore you cannot be surprised when I\ndeclare myself displeased with your visits and behaviour to my\nmistress, and demand that you will instantly promise to drop the\ncorrespondence.” “Else what follows?” answered Ferdinand, with a cool\nand temperate voice. “My resentment and immediate defiance,” replied\nthe other; “for the only alternative I propose is, to forego your\ndesign upon that lady, or to decide our pretension by the sword.”\n\nOur hero, having expressed a regard for this visitant as the son of a\ngentleman whom he honoured, was at the pains to represent the\nunreasonableness of his demand, and the folly of his presumption; and\nearnestly exhorted him to put the issue of his cause upon a more safe\nand equitable footing. But this admonition, instead of appeasing the\nwrath, seemed to inflame the resentment of the opponent, who swore he\nwould not leave him until he should have accomplished the purport of\nhis errand. In vain our adventurer requested half an hour for the\ndespatch of some urgent business, in which he was engaged with a\ngentleman in the other parlour. This impetuous rival rejected all the\nterms he could propose, and even challenged him to decide the\ncontroversy upon the spot; an expedient to which the other having\nassented with reluctance, the door was secured, the swords unsheathed,\nand a hot engagement ensued, to the inexpressible pleasure of the\nSwiss, who did not doubt that he himself would be screened from all\ndanger by the event of this rencontre. Nevertheless, his hope was\ndisappointed in the defeat of the stranger, who was quickly disarmed,\nin consequence of a wound through the sword-arm; upon which occasion\nFathom was heard to say, that, in consideration of his youth and\nfamily, he had spared his life; but he would not act with the same\ntenderness towards any other antagonist. He then bound up the limb he\nhad disabled, conducted the vanquished party to his chair, rejoined the\nchevalier with a serene countenance, and, asking pardon for having\ndetained him so long, proposed they should instantly set out in a\nhackney-coach for the place of appointment.\n\nThe stratagem thus conducted, had all the success the inventor could\ndesire. The fear of the Swiss had risen almost to an ecstasy before the\nCount quitted the room; but after this sham battle, which had been\npreconcerted betwixt our adventurer and his friend Ratchcali, the\nchevalier’s terrors were unspeakable. He considered Fathom as a devil\nincarnate, and went into the coach as a malefactor bound for Tyburn. He\nwould have gladly compounded for the loss of a leg or arm, and\nentertained some transient gleams of hope, that he should escape for\nhalf a dozen flesh-wounds, which he would have willingly received as\nthe price of his presumption; but these hopes were banished by the\nremembrance of that dreadful declaration which he had heard the Count\nmake, after having overcome his last adversary; and he continued under\nthe power of the most unsupportable panic, until the carriage halted at\nHyde Park Corner, where he crawled forth in a most piteous and\nlamentable condition; so that, when they reached the spot, he was\nscarce able to stand.\n\nHere he made an effort to speak, and propose an accommodation upon a\nnew plan, by which he promised to leave his cause to the arbitrement of\nthose gentlemen who were present at the rupture, and to ask pardon of\nthe Count, provided he should be found guilty of a trespass upon good\nmanners; but this proposal would not satisfy the implacable Ferdinand,\nwho, perceiving the agony of the Swiss, resolved to make the most of\nthe adventure, and giving him to understand he was not a man to be\ntrifled with, desired him to draw without further preamble. Thus\ncompelled, the unfortunate gamester pulled off his coat, and, putting\nhimself in a posture, to use the words of Nym, “winked, and held out\nhis cold iron.”\n\nOur adventurer, far from making a gentle use of the advantages he\npossessed, fiercely attacked him, while he was incapable of making\nresistance, and, aiming at a fleshy part, ran him through the arm and\noutside of the shoulder at the very first pass. The chevalier, already\nstupefied with the horror of expectation, no sooner felt his\nadversary’s point in his body than he fell to the ground, and,\nconcluding he was no longer a man for this world, began to cross\nhimself with great devotion; while Fathom walked home deliberately, and\nin his way sent a couple of chairmen to the assistance of the wounded\nknight.\n\nThis achievement, which could not be concealed from the knowledge of\nthe public, not only furnished the character of Fathom with fresh\nwreaths of admiration and applause, but likewise effectually secured\nhim from any future attempts of his enemies, to whom the Swiss, for his\nown sake, had communicated such terrible ideas of his valour, as\noverawed the whole community.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\n\nHE PERFORMS ANOTHER EXPLOIT, THAT CONVEYS A TRUE IDEA OF HIS GRATITUDE\nAND HONOUR.\n\nIt was not long after this celebrated victory, that he was invited to\nspend part of the summer at the house of a country gentleman, who lived\nabout one hundred miles from London, possessed of a very opulent\nfortune, the greatest part of which was expended in acts of old English\nhospitality. He had met with our hero by accident at the table of a\ncertain great man, and was so struck with his manner and conversation,\nas to desire his acquaintance, and cultivate his friendship; and he\nthought himself extremely happy in having prevailed upon him to pass a\nfew weeks in his family.\n\nFathom, among his other observations, perceived that there was a\ndomestic uneasiness, occasioned by a very beautiful young creature\nabout the age of fifteen, who resided in the house under the title of\nthe gentleman’s niece, though she was in reality his natural daughter,\nborn before his marriage. This circumstance was not unknown to his\nlady, by whose express approbation he had bestowed particular attention\nupon the education of the child, whom we shall distinguish by the name\nof Celinda. Their liberality in this particular had not been\nmisapplied; for she not only gave marks of uncommon capacity, but, as\nshe grew up, became more and more amiable in her person, and was now\nreturned from the boarding school, possessed of every accomplishment\nthat could be acquired by one of her age and opportunities. These\nqualifications, which endeared her to every other person, excited the\njealousy and displeasure of her supposed aunt, who could not bear to\nsee her own children eclipsed by this illegitimate daughter, whom she\ntherefore discountenanced upon all occasions, and exposed to such\nmortifications as would in all appearance drive her from her father’s\nhouse. This persecuting spirit was very disagreeable to the husband,\nwho loved Celinda with a truly paternal affection, and produced\nabundance of family disquiet; but being a man of a peaceable and\nyielding disposition, he could not long maintain the resolution he had\ntaken in her favour, and therefore he ceased opposing the malevolence\nof his wife.\n\nIn this unfortunate predicament stood the fair bastard, at the arrival\nof our adventurer, who, being allured by her charms, apprised of her\nsituation at the same time, took the generous resolution to undermine\nher innocence, that he might banquet his vicious appetite with the\nspoils of her beauty. Perhaps such a brutal design might not have\nentered his imagination, if he had not observed, in the disposition of\nthis hapless maiden, certain peculiarities from which he derived the\nmost confident presages of success. Besides a total want of experience,\nthat left her open and unguarded against the attacks of the other sex,\nshe discovered a remarkable spirit of credulity and superstitious fear,\nwhich had been cherished by the conversation of her school-fellows. She\nwas particularly fond of music, in which she had made some progress;\nbut so delicate was the texture of her nerves, that one day, while\nFathom entertained the company with a favourite air, she actually\nswooned with pleasure.\n\nSuch sensibility, our projector well knew, must be diffused through all\nthe passions of her heart; he congratulated himself upon the sure\nascendency he had gained over her in this particular; and forthwith\nbegan to execute the plan he had erected for her destruction. That he\nmight the more effectually deceive the vigilance of her father’s wife,\nhe threw such a dash of affectation in his complaisance towards\nCelinda, as could not escape the notice of that prying matron, though\nit was not palpable enough to disoblige the young lady herself, who\ncould not so well distinguish between overstrained courtesy and real\ngood breeding. This behaviour screened him from the suspicion of the\nfamily, who considered it as an effort of politeness, to cover his\nindifference and disgust for the daughter of his friend, who had by\nthis time given some reason to believe she looked upon him with the\neyes of affection; so that the opportunities he enjoyed of conversing\nwith her in private, were less liable to intrusion or inquiry. Indeed,\nfrom what I have already observed, touching the sentiments of her\nstepdame, that lady, far from taking measures for thwarting our hero’s\ndesign, would have rejoiced at the execution of it, and, had she been\ninformed of his intent, might have fallen upon some method to\nfacilitate the enterprise; but, as he solely depended upon his own\ntalents, he never dreamed of soliciting such an auxiliary.\n\nUnder cover of instructing and accomplishing her in the exercise of\nmusic, he could not want occasions for promoting his aim; when, after\nhaving soothed her sense of hearing, even to a degree of ravishment, so\nas to extort from her an exclamation, importing, that he was surely\nsomething supernatural! he never failed to whisper some insidious\ncompliment or tale of love, exquisitely suited to the emotions of her\nsoul. Thus was her heart insensibly subdued; though more than half his\nwork was still undone; for, at all times, she disclosed such purity of\nsentiment, such inviolable attachment to religion and virtue, and\nseemed so averse to all sorts of inflammatory discourse, that he durst\nnot presume upon the footing he had gained in her affection, to explain\nthe baseness of his desire; he therefore applied to another of her\npassions, that proved the bane of her virtue. This was her timidity,\nwhich at first being constitutional, was afterwards increased by the\ncircumstances of her education, and now aggravated by the artful\nconversation of Fathom, which he chequered with dismal stories of\nomens, portents, prophecies, and apparitions, delivered upon such\nunquestionable testimony, and with such marks of conviction, as\ncaptivated the belief of the devoted Celinda, and filled her\nimagination with unceasing terrors.\n\nIn vain she strove to dispel those frightful ideas, and avoid such\ntopics of discourse for the future. The more she endeavoured to banish\nthem, the more troublesome they became; and such was her infatuation,\nthat as her terrors increased, her thirst after that sort of knowledge\nwas augmented. Many sleepless nights did she pass amidst those horrors\nof fancy, starting at every noise, and sweating with dreary\napprehension, yet ashamed to own her fears, or solicit the comfort of a\nbedfellow, lest she should incur the ridicule and censure of her\nfather’s wife; and what rendered this disposition the more irksome, was\nthe solitary situation of her chamber, that stood at the end of a long\ngallery scarce within hearing of any other inhabited part of the house.\n\nAll these circumstances had been duly weighed by our projector, who,\nhaving prepared Celinda for his purpose, stole at midnight from his\napartment, which was in another storey, and approaching her door, there\nuttered a piteous groan; then softly retired to his bed, in full\nconfidence of seeing next day the effect of this operation. Nor did his\narrow miss the mark. Poor Celinda’s countenance gave such indications\nof melancholy and dismay, that he could not omit asking the cause of\nher disquiet, and she, at his earnest request, was prevailed upon to\ncommunicate the dreadful salutation of the preceding night, which she\nconsidered as an omen of death to some person of the family, in all\nprobability to herself, as the groan seemed to issue from one corner of\nher own apartment. Our adventurer argued against this supposition, as\ncontradictory to the common observation of those supernatural warnings\nwhich are not usually imparted to the person who is doomed to die, but\nto some faithful friend, or trusty servant, particularly interested in\nthe event. He therefore supposed, that the groans foreboded the death\nof my lady, who seemed to be in a drooping state of health, and were,\nby her genius, conveyed to the organs of Celinda, who was the chief\nsufferer by her jealous and barbarous disposition; he likewise\nexpressed an earnest desire to be an ear-witness of such solemn\ncommunication, and, alleging that it was highly improper for a young\nlady of her delicate feelings to expose herself alone to such another\ndismal visitation, begged he might be allowed to watch all night in her\nchamber, in order to defend her from the shocking impressions of fear.\n\nThough no person ever stood more in need of a companion or guard, and\nher heart throbbed with transports of dismay at the prospect of night,\nshe rejected his proposal with due acknowledgment, and resolved to\ntrust solely to the protection of Heaven. Not that she thought her\ninnocence or reputation could suffer by her compliance with his\nrequest; for, hitherto, her heart was a stranger to those young desires\nwhich haunt the fancy, and warm the breast of youth; so that, being\nignorant of her danger, she saw not the necessity of avoiding\ntemptation; but she refused to admit a man into her bedchamber, merely\nbecause it was a step altogether opposite to the forms and decorum of\nlife. Nevertheless, far from being discouraged by this repulse, he knew\nher fears would multiply and reduce that reluctance, which, in order to\nweaken, he had recourse to another piece of machinery, that operated\npowerfully in behalf of his design.\n\nSome years ago, a twelve-stringed instrument was contrived by a very\ningenious musician, by whom it was aptly entitled the “Harp of Aeolus,”\nbecause, being properly applied to a stream of air, it produces a wild\nirregular variety of harmonious sounds, that seem to be the effect of\nenchantment, and wonderfully dispose the mind for the most romantic\nsituations. Fathom, who was really a virtuoso in music, had brought one\nof those new-fashioned guitars into the country, and as the effect of\nit was still unknown in the family, he that night converted it to the\npurposes of his amour, by fixing it in the casement of a window\nbelonging to the gallery, exposed to the west wind, which then blew in\na gentle breeze. The strings no sooner felt the impression of the balmy\nzephyr, than they began to pour forth a stream of melody more\nravishingly delightful than the song of Philomel, the warbling brook,\nand all the concert of the wood. The soft and tender notes of peace and\nlove were swelled up with the most delicate and insensible transition\ninto a loud hymn of triumph and exultation, joined by the deep-toned\norgan, and a full choir of voices, which gradually decayed upon the\near, until it died away in distant sound, as if a flight of angels had\nraised the song in their ascent to heaven. Yet the chords hardly ceased\nto vibrate after the expiration of this overture, which ushered in a\ncomposition in the same pathetic style; and this again was succeeded by\na third, almost without pause or intermission, as if the artist’s hand\nhad been indefatigable, and the theme never to be exhausted.\n\nHis heart must be quite callous, and his ear lost to all distinction,\nwho could hear such harmony without emotion; how deeply, then, must it\nhave affected the delicate Celinda, whose sensations, naturally acute,\nwere whetted to a most painful keenness by her apprehension; who could\nhave no previous idea of such entertainment, and was credulous enough\nto believe the most improbable tale of superstition! She was\noverwhelmed with awful terror, and, never doubting that the sounds were\nmore than mortal, recommended herself to the care of Providence in a\nsuccession of pious ejaculations.\n\nOur adventurer, having allowed some time for the effect of this\ncontrivance, repaired to her chamber door, and, in a whisper, conveyed\nthrough the keyhole, asked if she was awake, begged pardon for such an\nunseasonable visit, and desired to know her opinion of the strange\nmusic which he then heard. In spite of her notions of decency, she was\nglad of his intrusion, and, being in no condition to observe\npunctilios, slipped on a wrapper, opened the door, and, with a\nfaltering voice, owned herself frightened almost to distraction. He\npretended to console her with reflections, importing, that she was in\nthe hands of a benevolent Being, who would not impose upon his\ncreatures any task which they could not bear; he insisted upon her\nreturning to bed, and assured her he would not stir from her chamber\ntill day. Thus comforted, she betook herself again to rest, while he\nsat down in an elbow-chair at some distance from the bedside, and, in a\nsoft voice, began the conversation with her on the subject of those\nvisitations from above, which, though undertaken on pretence of\ndissipating her fear and anxiety, was, in reality, calculated for the\npurpose of augmenting both.\n\n“That sweet air,” said he, “seems designed for soothing the bodily\nanguish of some saint in his last moments. Hark! how it rises into a\nmore sprightly and elevated strain, as if it were an inspiriting\ninvitation to the realms of bliss! Sure, he is now absolved from all\nthe misery of this life! That full and glorious concert of voices and\ncelestial harps betoken his reception among the heavenly choir, who now\nwaft his soul to paradisian joys! This is altogether great, solemn, and\namazing! The clock strikes one, the symphony hath ceased!”\n\nThis was actually the case; for he had ordered Maurice to remove the\ninstrument at that hour, lest the sound of it should become too\nfamiliar, and excite the curiosity of some undaunted domestic, who\nmight frustrate his scheme by discovering the apparatus. As for poor\nCelinda, her fancy was, by his music and discourse, worked up to the\nhighest pitch of enthusiastic terrors; the whole bed shook with her\ntrepidation, the awful silence that succeeded the supernatural music\nthrew an additional damp upon her spirits, and the artful Fathom\naffecting to snore at the same time, she could no longer contain her\nhorror, but called upon his name with a fearful accent, and, having\nowned her present situation insupportable, entreated him to draw near\nher bedside, that he might be within touch on any emergency.\n\nThis was a welcome request to our adventurer, who, asking pardon for\nhis drowsiness, and taking his station on the side of her bed, exhorted\nher to compose herself; then locking her hand fast in his own, was\nagain seized with such an inclination to sleep, that he gradually sunk\ndown by her side, and seemed to enjoy his repose in that attitude.\nMeanwhile, his tender-hearted mistress, that he might not suffer in his\nhealth by his humanity and complaisance, covered him with the\ncounterpane as he slept, and suffered him to take his rest without\ninterruption, till he thought proper to start up suddenly with an\nexclamation of, “Heaven watch over us!” and then asked, with symptoms\nof astonishment, if she had heard nothing. Such an abrupt address upon\nsuch an occasion, did not fail to amaze and affright the gentle\nCelinda, who, unable to speak, sprung towards her treacherous\nprotector; and he, catching her in his arms, bade her fear nothing, for\nhe would, at the expense of his life, defend her from all danger.\n\nHaving thus, by tampering with her weakness, conquered the first and\nchief obstacles to his design, he, with great art and perseverance,\nimproved the intercourse to such a degree of intimacy, as could not but\nbe productive of all the consequences which he had foreseen. The groans\nand music were occasionally repeated, so as to alarm the whole family,\nand inspire a thousand various conjectures. He failed not to continue\nhis nocturnal visits and ghastly discourse, until his attendance became\nso necessary to this unhappy maiden, that she durst not stay in her own\nchamber without his company, nor even sleep, except in contact with her\nbetrayer.\n\nSuch a commerce between two such persons of a different sex could not\npossibly be long carried on, without degenerating from the Platonic\nsystem of sentimental love. In her paroxysms of dismay, he did not\nforget to breathe the soft inspirations of his passion, to which she\nlistened with more pleasure, as they diverted the gloomy ideas of her\nfear; and by this time his extraordinary accomplishments had made a\nconquest of her heart. What therefore could be a more interesting\ntransition than that from the most uneasy to the most agreeable\nsensation of the human breast?\n\nThis being the case, the reader will not wonder that a consummate\ntraitor, like Fathom, should triumph over the virtue of an artless,\ninnocent young creature, whose passions he had entirely under his\ncommand. The gradations towards vice are almost imperceptible, and an\nexperienced seducer can strew them with such enticing and agreeable\nflowers, as will lead the young sinner on insensibly, even to the most\nprofligate stages of guilt. All therefore that can be done by virtue,\nunassisted with experience, is to avoid every trial with such a\nformidable foe, by declining and discouraging the first advances\ntowards a particular correspondence with perfidious man, howsoever\nagreeable it may seem to be. For here is no security but in conscious\nweakness.\n\nFathom, though possessed of the spoils of poor Celinda’s honour, did\nnot enjoy his success with tranquillity. Reflection and remorse often\ninvaded her in the midst of their guilty pleasures, and embittered all\nthose moments they had dedicated to mutual bliss. For the seeds of\nvirtue are seldom destroyed at once. Even amidst the rank productions\nof vice, they regerminate to a sort of imperfect vegetation, like some\nscattered hyacinths shooting up among the weeds of a ruined garden,\nthat testify the former culture and amenity of the soil. She sighed at\nthe sad remembrance of that virgin dignity which she had lost; she wept\nat the prospect of that disgrace, mortification, and misery she should\nundergo, when abandoned by this transient lover, and severely\nreproached him for the arts he had used to shipwreck her innocence and\npeace.\n\nSuch expostulations are extremely unseasonable, when addressed to a man\nwell-nigh sated with the effects of his conquest. They act like strong\nblasts of wind applied to embers almost extinguished, which, instead of\nreviving the flame, scatter and destroy every remaining particle of\nfire. Our adventurer, in the midst of his peculiarities, had\ninconstancy in common with the rest of his sex. More than half cloyed\nwith the possession of Celinda, he could not fail to be disgusted with\nher upbraidings; and had she not been the daughter of a gentleman whose\nfriendship he did not think it his interest to forfeit, he would have\ndropped this correspondence, without reluctance or hesitation. But, as\nhe had measures to keep with a family of such consequence, he\nconstrained his inclinations, so far as to counterfeit those raptures\nhe no longer felt, and found means to appease those intervening tumults\nof her grief.\n\nForeseeing, however, that it would not be always in his power to\nconsole her on these terms, he resolved, if possible, to divide her\naffection, which now glowed upon him too intensely; and, with that\nview, whenever she complained of the vapours or dejection, he\nprescribed, and even insisted upon her swallowing certain cordials of\nthe most palatable composition, without which he never travelled; and\nthese produced such agreeable reveries and flow of spirits, that she\ngradually became enamoured of intoxication; while he encouraged the\npernicious passion, by expressing the most extravagant applause and\nadmiration at the wild irregular sallies it produced. Without having\nfirst made this diversion, he would have found it impracticable to\nleave the house with tranquillity; but, when this bewitching philtre\ngrew into an habit, her attachment to Ferdinand was insensibly\ndissolved; she began to bear his neglect with indifference, and,\nsequestering herself from the rest of the family, used to solicit this\nnew ally for consolation.\n\nHaving thus put the finishing stroke to the daughter’s ruin, he took\nleave of the father, with many acknowledgments and expressions of\ngratitude for his hospitality and friendship, and, riding across the\ncountry to Bristol, took up his habitation near the hot well, where he\nstayed during the remaining part of the season. As for the miserable\nCelinda, she became more and more addicted to the vices in which she\nhad been initiated by his superlative perfidy and craft, until she was\nquite abandoned by decency and caution. Her father’s heart was torn\nwith anguish, while his wife rejoiced in her fall; at length her ideas\nwere quite debased by her infirmity; she grew every day more and more\nsensual and degenerate, and contracted an intimacy with one of the\nfootmen, who was kind enough to take her to wife, in hope of obtaining\na good settlement from his master; but, being disappointed in his aim,\nhe conducted her to London, where he made shift to insinuate himself\ninto another service, leaving her to the use, and partly the advantage,\nof her own person, which was still uncommonly attractive.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE\n\nHE REPAIRS TO BRISTOL SPRING, WHERE HE REIGNS PARAMOUNT DURING THE\nWHOLE SEASON.\n\nWe shall therefore leave her in this comfortable situation, and return\nto our adventurer, whose appearance at Bristol was considered as a\nhappy omen by the proprietor of the hot well, and all the people who\nlive by the resort of company to that celebrated spring. Nor were they\ndeceived in their prognostic. Fathom, as usual, formed the nucleus or\nkernel of the beau monde; and the season soon became so crowded, that\nmany people of fashion were obliged to quit the place for want of\nlodging. Ferdinand was the soul that animated the whole society. He not\nonly invented parties of pleasure, but also, by his personal talents,\nrendered them more agreeable. In a word, he regulated their diversions,\nand the master of the ceremonies never would allow the ball to be begun\ntill the Count was seated.\n\nHaving thus made himself the object of admiration and esteem, his\nadvice was an oracle, to which they had recourse in all doubtful cases\nof punctilio or dispute, or even of medicine; for among his other\naccomplishments, his discourse on that subject was so plausible, and\nwell adapted to the understanding of his hearers, that any person who\nhad not actually studied the medical art would have believed he was\ninspired by the spirit of Aesculapius. What contributed to the\naggrandisement of his character in this branch of knowledge, was a\nvictory he obtained over an old physician, who plied at the well, and\nhad one day unfortunately begun to harangue in the pump-room upon the\nnature of the Bristol water. In the course of this lecture he undertook\nto account for the warmth of the fluid; and his ideas being perplexed\nwith a great deal of reading, which he had not been able to digest, his\ndisquisition was so indistinct, and his expression so obscure and\nunentertaining, that our hero seized the opportunity of displaying his\nown erudition, by venturing to contradict some circumstances of the\ndoctor’s hypothesis, and substituting a theory of his own, which, as he\nhad invented it for the purpose, was equally amusing and chimerical.\n\nHe alleged, that fire was the sole vivifying principle that pervaded\nall nature; that, as the heat of the sun concocted the juice of\nvegetables, and ripened those fruits that grow upon the surface of this\nglobe, there was likewise an immense store of central fire reserved\nwithin the bowels of the earth, not only for the generation of gems,\nfossils, and all the purposes of the mineral world, but likewise for\ncherishing and keeping alive those plants which would otherwise perish\nby the winter’s cold. The existence of such a fire he proved from the\nnature of all those volcanoes, which in almost every corner of the\nearth are continually vomiting up either flames or smoke. “These,” said\nhe, “are the great vents appointed by nature for the discharge of that\nrarefied air and combustible matter, which, if confined, would burst\nthe globe asunder; but, besides the larger outlets, there are some\nsmall chimneys through which part of the heat transpires; a vapour of\nthat sort, I conceive, must pass through the bed or channel of this\nspring, the waters of which, accordingly retain a moderate warmth.”\n\nThis account, which totally overthrew the other’s doctrine, was so\nextremely agreeable to the audience, that the testy doctor lost his\ntemper, and gave them to understand, without preamble, that he must be\na person wholly ignorant of natural philosophy, who could invent such a\nridiculous system, and they involved in worse than an Egyptian fog,\nthat could not at once discern its weakness and absurdity. This\ndeclaration introduced a dispute, which was unanimously determined in\nfavour of our adventurer. On all such occasions the stream of prejudice\nruns against the physician, even though his antagonist has nothing to\nrecommend himself to the favour of the spectators; and this decision\ndepends upon divers considerations. In the first place, there is a\ncontinual war carried on against the learned professions, by all those\nwho, conscious of their own ignorance, seek to level the reputation of\ntheir superiors with their own. Secondly, in all disputes upon physic\nthat happen betwixt a person who really understands the art, and an\nilliterate pretender, the arguments of the first will seem obscure and\nunintelligible to those who are unacquainted with the previous systems\non which they are built; while the other’s theory, derived from common\nnotions, and superficial observation, will be more agreeable, because\nbetter adapted to the comprehension of the hearers. Thirdly, the\njudgment of the multitude is apt to be biassed by that surprise which\nis the effect of seeing an artist foiled at his own weapons, by one who\nengages him only for amusement.\n\nFathom, besides these advantages, was blessed with a flow of language,\nan elegant address, a polite and self-denying style of argumentation,\ntogether with a temper not to be ruffled; so that the victory could not\nlong waver between him and the physician, to whom he was infinitely\nsuperior in every acquisition but that of solid learning, of which the\njudges had no idea. This contest was not only glorious but profitable\nto our adventurer, who grew into such request in his medical capacity,\nthat the poor doctor was utterly deserted by his patients, and Fathom’s\nadvice solicited by every valetudinarian in the place; nor did he\nforfeit the character he thus acquired by any miscarriages in his\npractice. Being but little conversant with the materia medica, the\ncircle of his prescriptions was very small; his chief study was to\navoid all drugs of rough operation and uncertain effect, and to\nadminister such only as should be agreeable to the palate, without\ndoing violence to the constitution. Such a physician could not but be\nagreeable to people of all dispositions; and, as most of the patients\nwere in some shape hypochondriac, the power of imagination,\nco-operating with his remedies, often effected a cure.\n\nOn the whole, it became the fashion to consult the Count in all\ndistempers, and his reputation would have had its run, though the death\nof every patient had given the lie to his pretensions. But empty fame\nwas not the sole fruit of his success. Though no person would presume\nto affront this noble graduate with a fee, they did not fail to\nmanifest their gratitude by some more valuable present. Every day some\nsuperb piece of china, curious snuffbox, or jewel, was pressed upon\nhim; so that, at the end of the season, he could almost have furnished\na toyshop with the acknowledgments he had received. Not only his\navarice, but his pleasure, was gratified in the course of his medical\nadministration. He enjoyed free access, egress, and regress with all\nthe females at the well, and no matron scrupled to put her daughter\nunder his care and direction. These opportunities could not be lost\nupon a man of his intriguing genius; though he conducted his amours\nwith such discretion, that, during the whole season, no lady’s\ncharacter suffered on his account, yet he was highly fortunate in his\naddresses, and we may venture to affirm, that the reproach of\nbarrenness was more than once removed by the vigour of his endeavours.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\n\nHE IS SMITTEN WITH THE CHARMS OF A FEMALE ADVENTURER, WHOSE ALLUREMENTS\nSUBJECT HIM TO A NEW VICISSITUDE OF FORTUNE.\n\nAmong those who were distinguished by his gallantry was the young wife\nof an old citizen of London, who had granted her permission to reside\nat the hot well for the benefit of her health, under the eye and\ninspection of his own sister, who was a maiden of fifty years. The\npupil, whose name was Mrs. Trapwell, though low in stature, was finely\nshaped, her countenance engaging, though her complexion was brown, her\nhair in colour rivalled the raven’s back, and her eyes emulated the\nlustre of the diamond. Fathom had been struck with her first\nappearance; but found it impracticable to elude the vigilance of her\nduenna, so as to make a declaration of his flame; until she herself,\nguessing the situation of his thoughts, and not displeased with the\ndiscovery, thought proper to furnish him with the opportunity he\nwanted, by counterfeiting an indisposition, for the cure of which she\nknew his advice would be implored. This was the beginning of an\nacquaintance, which was soon improved to his wish; and so well did she\nmanage her attractions, as in some measure to fix the inconstancy of\nhis disposition; for, at the end of the season, his passion was not\nsated; and they concerted the means of continuing their commerce, even\nafter their return to London.\n\nThis intercourse effectually answered the purpose of the husband, who\nhad been decoyed into matrimony by the cunning of his spouse, whom he\nhad privately kept as a concubine before marriage. Conscious of her own\nprecarious situation, she had resolved to impose upon the infirmities\nof Trapwell, and, feigning herself pregnant, gave him to understand she\ncould no longer conceal her condition from the knowledge of her\nbrother, who was an officer in the army, and of such violent passions,\nthat, should he once discover her backsliding, he would undoubtedly\nwipe away the stains of his family dishonour with her own blood, as\nwell as that of her keeper. The citizen, to prevent such a catastrophe,\ntook her to wife; but soon after perceiving the trick which had been\nplayed upon him, set his invention at work, and at length contrived a\nscheme which he thought would enable him, not only to retrieve his\nliberty, but also indemnify himself for the mortification he had\nundergone.\n\nFar from creating any domestic disturbance, by upbraiding her with her\nfinesse, he seemed perfectly well pleased with his acquisition; and, as\nhe knew her void of any principle, and extremely addicted to pleasure,\nhe chose proper occasions to insinuate, that she might gratify her own\ninclination, and at the same time turn her beauty to good account. She\njoyfully listened to these remonstrances, and, in consequence of their\nmutual agreement, she repaired to Bristol Spring, on pretence of an ill\nstate of health, accompanied by her sister-in-law, whom they did not\nthink proper to intrust with the real motive of her journey. Fathom’s\nperson was agreeable, and his finances supposed to be in flourishing\norder; therefore, she selected him from the herd of gallants, as a\nproper sacrifice to the powers which she adored; and, on her arrival in\nLondon, made her husband acquainted with the importance of her\nconquest.\n\nTrapwell overwhelmed her with caresses and praise for her discreet and\ndutiful conduct, and faithfully promised that she should pocket in her\nown privy purse one-half of the spoils that should be gathered from her\ngallant, whom she therefore undertook to betray, after he had swore, in\nthe most solemn manner, that his intention was not to bring the affair\nto a public trial, which would redound to his own disgrace, but to\nextort a round sum of money from the Count, by way of composition.\nConfiding in this protestation, she in a few days gave him intelligence\nof an assignation she had made with our adventurer, at a certain bagnio\nnear Covent Garden; upon which he secured the assistance of a\nparticular friend and his own journeyman, with whom, and a constable,\nhe repaired to the place of rendezvous, where he waited in an adjoining\nroom, according to the directions of his virtuous spouse, until she\nmade the preconcerted signal of hemming three times aloud, when he and\nhis associates rushed into the chamber and surprised our hero in bed\nwith his inamorata.\n\nThe lady on this occasion acted her part to a miracle; she screamed at\ntheir approach; and, after an exclamation of “Ruined and undone!”\nfainted away in the arms of her spouse, who had by this time seized her\nby the shoulders, and begun to upbraid her with her infidelity and\nguilt. As for Fathom, his affliction was unutterable, when he found\nhimself discovered in that situation, and made prisoner by the two\nassistants, who had pinioned him in such a manner, that he could not\nstir, much less accomplish an escape. All his ingenuity and presence of\nmind seemed to forsake him in this emergency. The horrors of an English\njury overspread his imagination; for he at once perceived that the toil\ninto which he had fallen was laid for the purpose; consequently he took\nit for granted that there would be no deficiency in point of evidence.\nSoon as he recollected himself, he begged that no violence might be\noffered to his person, and entreated the husband to favour him with a\nconference, in which the affair might be compromised, without prejudice\nto the reputation of either.\n\nAt first Trapwell breathed nothing but implacable revenge, but, by the\npersuasion of his friends, after he had sent home his wife in a chair,\nhe was prevailed upon to hear the proposals of the delinquent, who\nhaving assured him, by way of apology, that he had always believed the\nlady was a widow, made him an offer of five hundred pounds, as an\natonement for the injury he had sustained. This being a sum no ways\nadequate to the expectation of the citizen, who looked upon the Count\nas possessor of an immense estate, he rejected the terms with disdain,\nand made instant application to a judge, from whom he obtained a\nwarrant for securing his person till the day of trial. Indeed, in this\ncase, money was but a secondary consideration with Trapwell, whose\nchief aim was to be legally divorced from a woman he detested.\nTherefore there was no remedy for the unhappy Count, who in vain\noffered to double the sum. He found himself reduced to the bitter\nalternative of procuring immediate bail, or going directly to Newgate.\n\nIn this dilemma he sent a messenger to his friend Ratchcali, whose\ncountenance fell when he understood the Count’s condition; nor would he\nopen his mouth in the style of consolation, until he had consulted a\ncertain solicitor of his acquaintance, who assured him the law abounded\nwith such resources as would infallibly screen the defendant, had the\nfact been still more palpable than it was. He said there was great\npresumption to believe the Count had fallen a sacrifice to a\nconspiracy, which by some means or other would be detected; and, in\nthat case, the plaintiff might obtain one shilling in lieu of damages.\nIf that dependence should fail, he hinted that, in all probability, the\nwitnesses were not incorruptible; or, should they prove to be so, one\nman’s oath was as good as another’s; and, thank Heaven, there was no\ndearth of evidence, provided money could be found to answer the\nnecessary occasions.\n\nRatchcali, comforted by these insinuations, and dreading the resentment\nof our adventurer, who, in his despair, might punish him severely for\nhis want of friendship, by some precipitate explanation of the commerce\nthey had carried on; moved, I say, by these considerations, and\nmoreover tempted with the prospect of continuing to reap the advantages\nresulting from their conjunction, he and another person of credit with\nwhom he largely dealt in jewels, condescended to become sureties for\nthe appearance of Fathom, who was accordingly admitted to bail. Not but\nthat the Tyrolese knew Ferdinand too well to confide in his parole. He\ndepended chiefly upon his ideas of self-interest, which, he thought,\nwould persuade him to risk the uncertain issue of a trial, rather than\nquit the field before the harvest was half over; and he was resolved to\nmake his own retreat without ceremony, should our hero be unwise enough\nto abandon his bail.\n\nSuch an adventure could not long lie concealed from the notice of the\npublic, even if both parties had been at pains to suppress the\ncircumstances. But the plaintiff, far from seeking to cover, affected\nto complain loudly of his misfortune, that he might interest his\nneighbours in his behalf, and raise a spirit of rancour and animosity,\nto influence the jury against this insolent foreigner, who had come\nover into England to debauch our wives and deflower our daughters;\nwhile he employed a formidable band of lawyers to support the\nindictment, which he laid at ten thousand pounds damages.\n\nMeanwhile, Fathom and his associate did not fail to take all proper\nmeasures for his defence; they retained a powerful bar of counsel, and\nthe solicitor was supplied with one hundred pounds after another, to\nanswer the expense of secret service; still assuring his clients that\neverything was in an excellent train, and that his adversary would gain\nnothing but shame and confusion of face. Nevertheless, there was a\nnecessity for postponing the trial, on account of a material evidence,\nwho, though he wavered, was not yet quite brought over; and the\nattorney found means to put off the decision from term to term, until\nthere was no quibble left for further delay. While this suit was\ndepending, our hero continued to move in his usual sphere; nor did the\nreport of his situation at all operate to his disadvantage in the\npolite world; on the contrary, it added a fresh plume to his character,\nin the eyes of all those who were not before acquainted with the\ntriumphs of his gallantry. Notwithstanding this countenance of his\nfriends, he himself considered the affair in a very serious light; and\nperceiving that, at any rate, he must be a considerable loser, he\nresolved to double his assiduity in trade, that he might be the more\nable to afford the extraordinary expense to which he was subjected.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\n\nFRESH CAUSE FOR EXERTING HIS EQUANIMITY AND FORTITUDE.\n\nThe reader may have observed, that Fathom, with all his circumspection,\nhad a weak side, which exposed him to sundry mischances; this was his\ncovetousness, which on some occasions became too hard for his\ndiscretion. At this period of time it was, by the circumstances of his\nsituation, inflamed to a degree of rapacity. He was now prevailed upon\nto take a hand at whist or piquet, and even to wield the hazard-box;\nthough he had hitherto declared himself an irreconcilable enemy to all\nsorts of play; and so uncommon was his success and dexterity at these\nexercises, as to surprise his acquaintance, and arouse the suspicion of\nsome people, who repined at his prosperity.\n\nBut in nothing was his conduct more inexcusable than in giving way to\nthe dangerous temerity of Ratchcali, which he had been always at pains\nto restrain, and permitting him to practise the same fraud upon an\nEnglish nobleman, which had been executed upon himself at Frankfort. In\nother words, the Tyrolese, by the canal of Ferdinand’s finger and\nrecommendation, sold a pebble for a real brilliant, and in a few days\nthe cheat was discovered, to the infinite confusion of our adventurer,\nwho nevertheless assumed the guise of innocence with so much art, and\nexpressed such indignation against the villain who had imposed upon his\njudgment and unsuspecting generosity, that his lordship acquitted him\nof any share in the deceit, and contented himself with the restitution,\nwhich he insisted upon making out of his own pocket, until he should be\nable to apprehend the rogue, who had thought proper to abscond for his\nown safety. In spite of all this exculpation, his character did not\nfail to retain a sort of stigma, which indeed the plainest proofs of\ninnocence are hardly able to efface; and his connexion with such a\npalpable knave as the Tyrolese appeared to be, had an effect to his\nprejudice in the minds of all those who were privy to the occurrence.\n\nWhen a man’s reputation is once brought in question, every trifle is,\nby the malevolence of mankind, magnified into a strong presumption\nagainst the culprit. A few whispers communicated by the envious mouth\nof slander, which he can have no opportunity to answer and refute,\nshall, in the opinion of the world, convict him of the most horrid\ncrimes; and for one hypocrite who is decked with the honours of virtue,\nthere are twenty good men who suffer the ignominy of vice; so well\ndisposed are individuals to trample upon the fame of their\nfellow-creatures. If the most unblemished merit is not protected from\nthis injustice, it will not be wondered at that no quarter was given to\nthe character of an adventurer like Fathom, who, among other unlucky\noccurrences, had the misfortune to be recognised about this time by his\ntwo Parisian friends, Sir Stentor Stile and Sir Giles Squirrel.\n\nThese worthy knights-errant had returned to their own country, after\nhaving made a very prosperous campaign in France, at the end of which,\nhowever, they very narrowly escaped the galleys; and seeing the Polish\nCount seated at the head of taste and politeness, they immediately\ncirculated the story of his defeat at Paris, with many ludicrous\ncircumstances of their own invention, and did not scruple to affirm\nthat he was a rank impostor. When the laugh is raised upon a great man,\nhe never fails to dwindle into contempt. Ferdinand began to perceive a\nchange in the countenance of his friends. His company was no longer\nsolicited with that eagerness which they had formerly expressed in his\nbehalf. Even his entertainments were neglected; when he appeared at any\nprivate or public assembly, the ladies, instead of glowing with\npleasure, as formerly, now tittered or regarded him with looks of\ndisdain; and a certain pert, little, forward coquette, with a view to\nput him out of countenance, by raising the laugh at his expense, asked\nhim one night, at a drum, when he had heard from his relations in\nPoland? She succeeded in her design upon the mirth of the audience, but\nwas disappointed in the other part of her aim; for our hero replied,\nwithout the least mark of discomposure, “They are all in good health at\nyour service, madam; I wish I knew in what part of the world your\nrelations reside, that I might return the compliment.” By this answer,\nwhich was the more severe, as the young lady was of very doubtful\nextraction, he retorted the laugh upon the aggressor, though he\nlikewise failed in his attempt upon her temper; for she was perhaps the\nonly person present who equalled himself in stability of countenance.\n\nNotwithstanding this appearance of unconcern, he was deeply touched\nwith these marks of alienation in the behaviour of his friends, and,\nforeseeing in his own disgrace the total shipwreck of his fortune, he\nentered into a melancholy deliberation with himself about the means of\nretrieving his importance in the beau monde, or of turning his address\ninto some other channel, where he could stand upon a less slippery\nfoundation. In this exercise of his thoughts, no scheme occurred more\nfeasible than that of securing the booty he had made, and retiring with\nhis associate, who was also blown, into some other country, where their\nnames and characters being unknown, they might pursue their old plan of\ncommerce without molestation. He imparted this suggestion to the\nTyrolese, who approved the proposal of decamping, though he combated\nwith all his might our hero’s inclination to withdraw himself before\nthe trial, by repeating the assurances of the solicitor, who told him\nhe might depend upon being reimbursed by the sentence of the court for\ngreat part of the sums he had expended in the course of the\nprosecution.\n\nFathom suffered himself to be persuaded by these arguments, supported\nwith the desire of making an honourable retreat, and, waiting patiently\nfor the day of trouble, discharged his sureties, by a personal\nappearance in court. Yet this was not the only score he discharged that\nmorning; the solicitor presented his own bill before they set out for\nWestminster Hall, and gave the Count to understand that it was the\ncustom, from time immemorial, for the client to clear with his attorney\nbefore trial. Ferdinand had nothing to object against this established\nrule, though he looked upon it as a bad omen, in spite of all the\nsolicitor’s confidence and protestations; and he was not a little\nconfounded, when, looking into the contents, he found himself charged\nwith 350 attendances. He knew it was not his interest to disoblige his\nlawyer at such a juncture; nevertheless, he could not help\nexpostulating with him on this article, which seemed to be so falsely\nstated with regard to the number; when his questions drew on an\nexplanation, by which he found he had incurred the penalty of three\nshillings and fourpence for every time he chanced to meet the\nconscientious attorney, either in the park, the coffee-house, or the\nstreet, provided they had exchanged the common salutation; and he had\ngood reason to believe the solicitor had often thrown himself in his\nway, with a view to swell this item of his account.\n\nWith this extortion our adventurer was fain to comply, because he lay\nat the mercy of the caitiff; accordingly, he with a good grace paid the\ndemand, which, including his former disbursements, amounted to three\nhundred and sixty-five pounds eleven shillings and threepence three\nfarthings, and then presenting himself before the judge, quietly\nsubmitted to the laws of the realm. His counsel behaved like men of\nconsummate abilities in their profession; they exerted themselves with\nequal industry, eloquence, and erudition, in their endeavours to\nperplex the truth, browbeat the evidence, puzzle the judge, and mislead\nthe jury; but the defendant found himself wofully disappointed in the\ndeposition of Trapwell’s journeyman, whom the solicitor pretended to\nhave converted to his interest. This witness, as the attorney\nafterwards declared, played booty, and the facts came out so clear,\nthat Ferdinand Count Fathom was convicted of criminal conversation with\nthe plaintiff’s wife, and cast in fifteen hundred pounds, under the\ndenomination of damages.\n\nHe was not so much surprised as afflicted at this decision, because he\nsaw it gradually approaching from the examination of the first\nevidence. His thoughts were now employed in casting about for some\nmethod of deliverance from the snare in which he found himself\nentangled. To escape, he foresaw it would be impracticable, as Trapwell\nwould undoubtedly be prepared for arresting him before he could quit\nWestminster Hall; he was too well acquainted with Ratchcali’s\nprinciples, to expect any assistance from that quarter in money\nmatters; and he was utterly averse to the payment of the sum awarded\nagainst him, which would have exhausted his whole fortune. He therefore\nresolved to try the friendship of some persons of fashion, with whom he\nhad maintained an intimacy of correspondence. Should they fail him in\nthe day of his necessity, he proposed to have recourse to his former\nsureties, one of whom he meant to bilk, while the other might accompany\nhim in his retreat; or, should both these expedients miscarry, he\ndetermined, rather than part with his effects, to undergo the most\ndisagreeable confinement, in hope of obtaining the jailor’s connivance\nat his escape.\n\nThese resolutions being taken, he met his fate with great fortitude and\nequanimity, and calmly suffered himself to be conveyed to the house of\na sheriff’s officer, who, as he made his exit from the hall, according\nto his own expectation, executed a writ against him, at the suit of\nTrapwell, for a debt of two thousand pounds. To this place he was\nfollowed by his solicitor, who was allured by the prospect of another\njob, and who, with great demonstrations of satisfaction, congratulated\nhim upon the happy issue of the trial; arrogating to himself the merit\nof having saved him eight thousand pounds in the article of damages, by\nthe previous steps he had taken, and the noble defence that he and his\nfriends the counsel had made for their client; he even hinted an\nexpectation of receiving a gratuity for his extraordinary care and\ndiscretion.\n\nFathom, galled as he was with his misfortune, and enraged at the\neffrontery of this pettifogger, maintained a serenity of countenance,\nand sent the attorney with a message to the plaintiff, importing, that,\nas he was a foreigner, and could not be supposed to have so much cash\nabout him, as to spare fifteen hundred pounds from the funds of his\nordinary expense, he would grant him a bond payable in two months,\nduring which period he should be able to procure a proper remittance\nfrom his own estate. While the solicitor was employed in this\nnegotiation, he despatched his valet-de-chambre to one nobleman, and\nMaurice to another, with billets, signifying the nature of the verdict\nwhich his adversary had obtained, and desiring that each would lend him\na thousand pounds upon his parole, until he could negotiate bills upon\nthe Continent.\n\nHis three messengers returned almost at the same instant of time, and\nthese were the answers they brought back.\n\nTrapwell absolutely rejected his personal security; and threatened him\nwith all the horrors of a jail, unless he would immediately discharge\nthe debt, or procure sufficient bondsmen; and one of his quality\nfriends favoured him with this reply to his request:—\n\n“MY DEAR COUNT!\nI am mortally chagrined at the triumph you have furnished to that\nrascally citizen. By the lard! the judge must have been in the terrors\nof cuckoldom, to influence the decision; and the jury a mere herd of\nhorned beasts, to bring in such a barbarous verdict. Egad! at this\nrate, no gentleman will be able to lie with another man’s wife, but at\nthe risk of a cursed prosecution. But to waive this disagreeable\ncircumstance, which you must strive to forget; I declare my\nmortification is still the greater, because I cannot at present supply\nyou with the trifle your present exigency requires; for, to tell you a\nsecret, my own finances are in damnable confusion. But a man of Count\nFathom’s figure and address can never be puzzled for the want of such a\npaltry sum. Adieu, my dear Count! we shall, I suppose, have the\npleasure of seeing you to-morrow at White’s: meanwhile, I have the\nhonour to be, with the most perfect attachment,\n\nyours, GRIZZLEGRIN.”\n\nThe other noble peer, to whom he addressed himself on this occasion,\ncherished the same sentiments of virtue, friendship, and generosity;\nbut his expression was so different, that we shall, for the edification\nof the reader, transcribe his letter in his own words:—\n\n“SIR,\nI was never more astonished than at the receipt of your very\nextraordinary billet, wherein you solicit the loan of a thousand\npounds, which you desire may be sent with the bearer on the faith of\nyour parole. Sir, I have no money to send you or lend you; and cannot\nhelp repeating my expressions of surprise at your confidence in making\nsuch a strange and unwarranted demand. ’Tis true, I may have made\nprofessions of friendship, while I looked upon you as a person of\nhonour and good morals; but now that you are convicted of such a\nflagrant violation of the laws of that kingdom where you have been\ntreated with such hospitality and respect, I think myself fully\nabsolved from any such conditional promise, which indeed is never\ninterpreted into any other than a bare compliment. I am sorry you have\ninvolved your character and fortune in such a disagreeable affair, and\nam,\n\nSir, yours, etc.\nTROMPINGTON.”\n\nFerdinand was not such a novice in the world as to be disappointed at\nthese repulses; especially as he had laid very little stress upon the\napplication, which was made by way of an experiment upon the gratitude\nor caprice of those two noblemen, whom he had actually more than once\nobliged with the same sort of assistance which he now solicited, though\nnot to such a considerable amount.\n\nHaving nothing further to expect from the fashionable world, he sent\nthe Tyrolese to the person who had been bail for his appearance, with\nfull instructions to explain his present occasion in the most\nfavourable light, and desire he would reinforce the credit of the Count\nwith his security; but that gentleman, though he placed the most\nperfect confidence on the honour of our hero, and would have willingly\nentered into bonds again for his personal appearance, was not quite so\nwell satisfied of his circumstances, as to become liable for the\npayment of two thousand pounds, an expense which, in his opinion, the\nfinances of no foreign Count were able to defray. He therefore lent a\ndeaf ear to the most pressing remonstrances of the ambassador, who had\nrecourse to several other merchants, with the same bad success; so that\nthe prisoner, despairing of bail, endeavoured to persuade Ratchcali,\nthat it would be his interest to contribute a thousand pounds towards\nhis discharge, that he might be enabled to quit England with a good\ngrace, and execute his part of the plan they had projected.\n\nSo powerful was his eloquence on the occasion, and such strength of\nargument did he use, that even the Tyrolese seemed convinced, though\nreluctantly, and agreed to advance the necessary sum upon the bond and\njudgment of our adventurer, who, being disabled from transacting his\nown affairs in person, was obliged to intrust Ratchcali with his keys,\npapers, and power of attorney, under the check and inspection of his\nfaithful Maurice and the solicitor, whose fidelity he bespoke with the\npromise of an ample recompense.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\n\nTHE BITER IS BIT.\n\nYet, he had no sooner committed his effects to the care of this\ntriumvirate, than his fancy was visited with direful warnings, which\nproduced cold sweats and palpitations, and threw him into such agonies\nof apprehension as he had never known before. He remembered the former\ndesertion of the Tyrolese, the recent villany of the solicitor, and\nrecollected the remarks he had made upon the disposition and character\nof his valet, which evinced him a fit companion for the other two.\n\nAlarmed at these reflections, he entreated the bailiff to indulge him\nwith a visit to his own lodgings, and even offered one hundred guineas\nas a gratification for his compliance. But the officer, who had\nformerly lost a considerable sum by the escape of a prisoner, would not\nrun any risk in an affair of such consequence, and our hero was obliged\nto submit to the tortures of his own presaging fears. After he had\nwaited five hours in the most racking impatience, he saw the attorney\nenter with all the marks of hurry, fatigue, and consternation, and\nheard him exclaim, “Good God, have you seen the gentleman?”\n\nFathom found his fears realised in this interrogation, to which he\nanswered in a tone of horror and dismay, “What gentleman? I suppose I\nam robbed. Speak, and keep me no longer in suspense.” “Robbed!” cried\nthe attorney, “the Lord forbid! I hope you can depend upon the person\nyou empowered to receive your jewels and cash? I must own his\nproceedings are a little extraordinary; for after he had rummaged your\nscrutoire, from which, in presence of me and your servant, he took one\nhundred and fifty guineas, a parcel of diamond rings and buckles,\naccording to this here inventory, which I wrote with my own hand, and\nEast India bonds to the tune of five hundred more, we adjourned to\nGarraway’s, where he left me alone, under pretence of going to a broker\nof his acquaintance who lived in the neighbourhood, while the valet, as\nI imagined, waited for us in the alley. Well, sir, he stayed so long,\nthat I began to be uneasy, and at length resolved to send the servant\nin quest of him, but when I went out for that purpose, deuce a servant\nwas to be found; though I in person inquired for him at every alehouse\nwithin half a mile of the place. I then despatched no less than five\nticket porters upon the scent after them, and I myself, by a direction\nfrom the bar-keeper, went to Signior Ratchcali’s lodgings, where, as\nthey told me, he had not been seen since nine o’clock in the morning.\nUpon this intimation, I came directly hither, to give you timely\nnotice, that you may without delay take measures for your own security.\nThe best thing you can do, is to take out writs for apprehending him,\nin the counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, and Essex, and I shall put\nthem in the hands of trusty and diligent officers, who will soon ferret\nhim out of his lurking-place, provided he skulks within ten miles of\nthe bills of mortality. To be sure, the job will be expensive; and all\nthese runners must be paid beforehand. But what then? the defendant is\nworth powder, and if we can once secure him, I’ll warrant the\nprosecution will quit cost.”\n\nFathom was almost choked with concern and resentment at the news of\nthis mischance, so that he could not utter one word until this\nnarrative was finished. Nor was his suspicion confined to the Tyrolese\nand his own lacquey; he considered the solicitor as their accomplice\nand director, and was so much provoked at the latter part of his\nharangue, that his discretion seemed to vanish, and, collaring the\nattorney, “Villain!” said he, “you yourself have been a principal actor\nin this robbery.” Then turning to the bystanders, “and I desire in the\nKing’s name that he may be secured, until I can make oath before a\nmagistrate in support of the charge. If you refuse your assistance in\ndetaining him, I will make immediate application to one of the\nsecretaries of state, who is my particular friend, and he will see\njustice done to all parties.”\n\nAt mention of this formidable name, the bailiff and his whole family\nwere in commotion, to obstruct the retreat of the lawyer, who stood\naghast and trembled under the grasp of our adventurer. But, soon as he\nfound himself delivered from this embrace, by the interposition of the\nspectators, and collected his spirits, which had been suddenly\ndissipated by Fathom’s unexpected assault, he began to display one art\nof his occupation, which he always reserved for extraordinary\noccasions. This was the talent of abuse, which he poured forth with\nsuch fluency of opprobrious language, that our hero, smarting as he\nwas, and almost desperate with his loss, deviated from that temperance\nof behaviour which he had hitherto preserved, and snatching up the\npoker, with one stroke opened a deep trench upon the attorney’s skull,\nthat extended from the hind head almost to the upper part of the nose,\nupon each side of which it discharged a sanguine stream.\nNotwithstanding the pain of this application, the solicitor was\ntransported with joy at the sense of the smart, and inwardly\ncongratulated himself upon the appearance of his own blood, which he no\nsooner perceived, than he exclaimed, “I’m a dead man,” and fell upon\nthe floor at full length.\n\nImmediate recourse was had to a surgeon in the neighbourhood, who,\nhaving examined the wound, declared there was a dangerous depression of\nthe first table of the skull, and that, if he could save the patient’s\nlife without the application of the trepan, it would be one of the\ngreatest cures that ever were performed. By this time, Fathom’s first\ntransport being overblown, he summoned up his whole resolution, and\nreflected upon his own ruin with that fortitude which had never failed\nhim in the emergencies of his fate. Little disturbed at the prognostic\nof the surgeon, which he considered in the right point of view; “Sir,”\nsaid he, “I am not so unacquainted with the resistance of an attorney’s\nskull, as to believe the chastisement I have bestowed on him will at\nall endanger his life, which is in much greater jeopardy from the hands\nof the common executioner. For, notwithstanding this accident, I am\ndetermined to prosecute the rascal for robbery with the utmost severity\nof the law; and, that I may have a sufficient fund left for that\nprosecution, I shall not at present throw away one farthing in\nunnecessary expense, but insist upon being conveyed to prison without\nfarther delay.”\n\nThis declaration was equally unwelcome to the bailiff, surgeon, and\nsolicitor, who, upon the supposition that the Count was a person of\nfortune, and would rather part with an immense sum than incur the\nignominy of a jail, or involve himself in another disgraceful lawsuit,\nhad resolved to fleece him to the utmost of their power. But, now the\nattorney finding him determined to set his fate at defiance, and to\nretort upon him a prosecution, which he had no design to undergo, began\nto repent heartily of the provocation he had given, and to think\nseriously on some method to overcome the obstinacy of the incensed\nforeigner. With this view, while the bailiff conducted him to bed in\nanother apartment, he desired the catchpole to act the part of mediator\nbetween him and the Count, and furnished him with proper instructions\nfor that purpose. Accordingly the landlord, on his return, told Fathom\nthat he was sure the solicitor was not a man for this world; for that\nhe had left him deprived of his senses, and praying to God with great\ndevotion for mercy to his murderer. He then exhorted him, with many\nprotestations of friendship, to compromise the unhappy affair by\nexchanging releases with the attorney before his delirium should be\nknown, otherwise he would bring himself into a most dangerous\npremunire, whether the plaintiff should die of his wound, or live to\nprosecute him for assault. “And with regard to your charge of robbery\nagainst him,” said he, “as it is no more than a base suspicion,\nunsupported by the least shadow of evidence, the bill would be thrown\nout, and then he might sue you for damages. I therefore, out of pure\nfriendship and good-nature, advise you to compromise the affair, and,\nif you think proper, will endeavour to bring about a mutual release.”\n\nOur hero, whose passion was by this time pretty well cooled, saw reason\nfor assenting to the proposal; upon which the deed was immediately\nexecuted, the mediator’s bill was discharged, and Ferdinand conveyed in\nan hackney-coach to prison, after he had empowered his own landlord to\ndischarge his servants, and convert his effects into ready money. Thus,\nhe saw himself, in the course of a few hours, deprived of his\nreputation, rank, liberty, and friends; and his fortune reduced from\ntwo thousand pounds to something less than two hundred, fifty of which\nhe had carried to jail in his pocket.\n\nEND OF VOL. I.\n\n THE ADVENTURES OF FERDINAND COUNT FATHOM\n\nby Tobias Smollett\n\nTitlepage\n\nCOMPLETE IN TWO PARTS\n\n PART II.\n\nWith the Author’s Preface, and an Introduction by G. H. Maynadier,\nPh.D. Department of English, Harvard University.\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF FERDINAND COUNT FATHOM\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-NINE\n\nOUR ADVENTURER IS MADE ACQUAINTED WITH A NEW SCENE OF LIFE.\n\nJust as he entered these mansions of misery, his ears were invaded with\na hoarse and dreadful voice, exclaiming, “You, Bess Beetle, score a\ncouple of fresh eggs, a pennyworth of butter, and half a pint of\nmountain to the king; and stop credit till the bill is paid:—He is now\ndebtor for fifteen shillings and sixpence, and d—n me if I trust him\none farthing more, if he was the best king in Christendom. And, d’ye\nhear, send Ragged-head with five pounds of potatoes for Major\nMacleaver’s supper, and let him have what drink he wants; the fat widow\ngentlewoman from Pimlico has promised to quit his score. Sir Mungo\nBarebones may have some hasty pudding and small beer, though I don’t\nexpect to see his coin, no more than to receive the eighteen pence I\nlaid out for a pair of breeches to his backside—what then? he’s a quiet\nsort of a body, and a great scholar, and it was a scandal to the place\nto see him going about in that naked condition. As for the mad\nFrenchman with the beard, if you give him so much as a cheese-paring,\nyou b—ch, I’ll send you back to the hole, among your old companions; an\nimpudent dog! I’ll teach him to draw his sword upon the governor of an\nEnglish county jail. What! I suppose he thought he had to do with a\nFrench hang-tang-dang, rabbit him! he shall eat his white feather,\nbefore I give him credit for a morsel of bread.”\n\nAlthough our adventurer was very little disposed, at this juncture, to\nmake observations foreign to his own affairs, he could not help taking\nnotice of these extraordinary injunctions; especially those concerning\nthe person who was entitled king, whom, however, he supposed to be some\nprisoner elected as the magistrate by the joint suffrage of his\nfellows. Having taken possession of his chamber, which he rented at\nfive shillings a week, and being ill at ease in his own thoughts, he\nforthwith secured his door, undressed, and went to bed, in which,\nthough it was none of the most elegant or inviting couches, he enjoyed\nprofound repose after the accumulated fatigues and mortifications of\nthe day. Next morning, after breakfast, the keeper entered his\napartment, and gave him to understand, that the gentlemen under his\ncare, having heard of the Count’s arrival, had deputed one of their\nnumber to wait upon him with the compliments of condolence suitable to\nthe occasion, and invite him to become a member of their society. Our\nhero could not politely dispense with this instance of civility, and\ntheir ambassador being instantly introduced by the name of Captain\nMinikin, saluted him with great solemnity.\n\nThis was a person equally remarkable for his extraordinary figure and\naddress; his age seemed to border upon forty, his stature amounted to\nfive feet, his visage was long, meagre, and weather-beaten, and his\naspect, though not quite rueful, exhibited a certain formality, which\nwas the result of care and conscious importance. He was very little\nencumbered with flesh and blood; yet what body he had was well\nproportioned, his limbs were elegantly turned, and by his carriage he\nwas well entitled to that compliment which we pay to any person when we\nsay he has very much the air of a gentleman. There was also an evident\nsingularity in his dress, which, though intended as an improvement,\nappeared to be an extravagant exaggeration of the mode, and at once\nevinced him an original to the discerning eyes of our adventurer, who\nreceived him with his usual complaisance, and made a very eloquent\nacknowledgment of the honour and satisfaction he received from the\nvisit of the representative, and the hospitality of his constituents.\nThe captain’s peculiarities were not confined to his external\nappearance; for his voice resembled the sound of a bassoon, or the\naggregate hum of a whole bee-hive, and his discourse was almost nothing\nelse than a series of quotations from the English poets, interlarded\nwith French phrases, which he retained for their significance, on the\nrecommendation of his friends, being himself unacquainted with that or\nany other outlandish tongue.\n\nFathom, finding this gentleman of a very communicative disposition,\nthought he could not have a fairer opportunity of learning the history\nof his fellow-prisoners; and, turning the conversation on that subject,\nwas not disappointed in his expectation. “I don’t doubt, sir,” said he,\nwith the utmost solemnity of declamation, “but you look with horror\nupon every object that surrounds you in this uncomfortable place; but,\nnevertheless, here are some, who, as my friend Shakespeare has it, have\nseen better days, and have with holy bell been knolled to church; and\nsat at good men’s feasts, and wiped their eyes of drops that sacred\npity hath engendered. You must know, sir, that, exclusive of the\ncanaille, or the profanum vulgus, as they are styled by Horace, there\nare several small communities in the jail, consisting of people who are\nattracted by the manners and dispositions of each other; for this\nplace, sir, is quite a microcosm, and as the great world, so is this, a\nstage, and all the men and women merely players. For my own part, sir,\nI have always made it a maxim to associate with the best of company I\ncan find. Not that I pretend to boast of my family or extraction;\nbecause, you know, as the poet says, Vix ea nostra voco. My father,\n’tis true, was a man that piqued himself upon his pedigree, as well as\nupon his politesse and personal merit; for he had been a very old\nofficer in the army, and I myself may say I was born with a spontoon in\nmy hand. Sir, I have had the honour to serve his Majesty these twenty\nyears, and have been bandied about in the course of duty through all\nthe British plantations, and you see the recompense of all my service.\nBut this is a disagreeable subject, and therefore I shall waive it;\nhowever, as Butler observes:\n\nMy only comfort is, that now\nMy dubbolt fortune is so low,\nThat either it must quickly end,\nOr turn about again and mend.\n\n“And now, to return from this digression, you will perhaps be surprised\nto hear that the head or chairman of our club is really a sovereign\nprince; no less, I’ll assure you, than the celebrated Theodore king of\nCorsica, who lies in prison for a debt of a few hundred pounds. Heu!\nquantum mutatus ab illo. It is not my business to censure the conduct\nof my superiors; but I always speak my mind in a cavalier manner, and\nas, according to the Spectator, talking to a friend is no more than\nthinking aloud, entre nous, his Corsican majesty has been scurvily\ntreated by a certain administration. Be that as it will, he is a\npersonage of a very portly appearance, and is quite master of the\nbienseance. Besides, they will find it their interest to have recourse\nagain to his alliance; and in that case some of us may expect to profit\nby his restoration. But few words are best.\n\n“He that maintains the second rank in our assembly is one Major\nMacleaver, an Irish gentleman, who has served abroad; a soldier of\nfortune, sir, a man of unquestionable honour and courage, but a little\noverbearing, in consequence of his knowledge and experience. He is a\nperson of good address,—to be sure, and quite free of the mauvaise\nhonte, and he may have seen a good deal of service. But what then?\nother people may be as good as he, though they have not had such\nopportunities; if he speaks five or six languages, he does not pretend\nto any taste in the liberal arts, which are the criterion of an\naccomplished gentleman.\n\n“The next is Sir Mungo Barebones, the representative of a very ancient\nfamily in the north; his affairs are very much deranged, but he is a\ngentleman of great probity and learning, and at present engaged in a\nvery grand scheme, which, if he can bring it to bear, will render him\nfamous to all posterity; no less than the conversion of the Jews and\nthe Gentiles. The project, I own, looks chimerical to one who has not\nconversed with the author; but, in my opinion, he has clearly\ndemonstrated, from an anagrammatical analysis of a certain Hebrew word,\nthat his present Majesty, whom God preserve, is the person pointed at\nin Scripture as the temporal Messiah of the Jews; and, if he could once\nraise by subscription such a trifling sum as twelve hundred thousand\npounds, I make no doubt but he would accomplish his aim, vast and\nromantic as it seems to be.\n\n“Besides these, we have another messmate, who is a French chevalier, an\nodd sort of a man, a kind of Lazarillo de Tormes, a caricatura; he\nwears a long beard, pretends to be a great poet, and makes a d—-ed\nfracas with his verses. The king has been obliged to exert his\nauthority over him more than once, by ordering him into close\nconfinement, for which he was so rash as to send his majesty a\nchallenge; but he afterwards made his submission, and was again taken\ninto favour. The truth is, I believe his brain is a little disordered,\nand, he being a stranger, we overlook his extravagancies.\n\n“Sir, we shall think ourselves happy in your accession to our society.\nYou will be under no sort of restraint; for, though we dine at one\ntable, every individual calls and pays for his own mess. Our\nconversation, such as it is, will not, I hope, be disagreeable; and\nthough we have not opportunities of breathing the pure Arcadian air,\nand cannot, ‘under the shade of melancholy boughs, lose and neglect the\ncreeping hours of time,’ we may enjoy ourselves over a glass of punch\nor a dish of tea. Nor are we destitute of friends, who visit us in\nthese shades of distress. The major has a numerous acquaintance of both\nsexes; among others, a first cousin of good fortune, who, with her\ndaughters, often cheer our solitude; she is a very sensible ladylike\ngentlewoman, and the young ladies have a certain degagee air, that\nplainly shows they have seen the best company. Besides, I will venture\nto recommend Mrs. Minikin as a woman of tolerable breeding and\ncapacity, who, I hope, will not be found altogether deficient in the\naccomplishments of the sex. So that we find means to make little\nparties, in which the time glides away insensibly. Then I have a small\ncollection of books which are at your service. You may amuse yourself\nwith Shakespeare, or Milton, or Don Quixote, or any of our modern\nauthors that are worth reading, such as the Adventures of Loveill, Lady\nFrail, George Edwards, Joe Thompson, Bampfylde Moore Carew, Young\nScarron, and Miss Betsy Thoughtless; and if you have a taste for\ndrawing, I can entertain you with a parcel of prints by the best\nmasters.”\n\nA man of our hero’s politeness could not help expressing himself in the\nwarmest terms of gratitude for this courteous declaration. He thanked\nthe captain in particular for his obliging offers, and begged he would\nbe so good as to present his respects to the society, of which he\nlonged to be a member. It was determined, therefore, that Minikin\nshould return in an hour, when the Count would be dressed, in order to\nconduct him into the presence of his majesty; and he had already taken\nhis leave for the present, when all of a sudden he came back, and\ntaking hold of a waistcoat that lay upon a chair, “Sir,” said he, “give\nme leave to look at that fringe; I think it is the most elegant\nknitting I ever saw. But pray, sir, are not these quite out of fashion?\nI thought plain silk, such as this that I wear, had been the mode, with\nthe pockets very low.” Before Fathom had time to make any sort of\nreply, he took notice of his hat and pumps; the first of which, he\nsaid, was too narrow in the brims, and the last an inch too low in the\nheels. Indeed, they formed a remarkable contrast with his own; for,\nexclusive of the fashion of the cock, which resembled the form of a\nRoman galley, the brim of his hat, if properly spread, would have\nprojected a shade sufficient to shelter a whole file of musketeers from\nthe heat of a summer’s sun; and the heels of his shoes were so high as\nto raise his feet three inches at least from the surface of the earth.\n\nHaving made these observations, for the credit of his taste, he\nretired, and returning at the time appointed, accompanied Ferdinand to\nthe apartment of the king, at the doors of which their ears were\ninvaded with a strange sound, being that of a human voice imitating the\nnoise of a drum. The captain, hearing this alarm, made a full stop,\nand, giving the Count to understand that his majesty was busy, begged\nhe would not take it amiss, if the introduction should be delayed for a\nfew moments. Fathom, curious to know the meaning of what he had heard,\napplied to his guide for information, and learned that the king and the\nmajor, whom he had nominated to the post of his general-in-chief, were\nemployed in landing troops upon the Genoese territory; that is, that\nthey were settling beforehand the manner of their disembarkation.\n\nHe then, by the direction of his conductor, reconnoitred them through\nthe keyhole, and perceived the sovereign and his minister sitting on\nopposite sides of a deal board table, covered with a large chart or\nmap, upon which he saw a great number of mussel and oyster shells\nranged in a certain order, and, at a little distance, several regular\nsquares and columns made of cards cut in small pieces. The prince\nhimself, whose eyes were reinforced by spectacles, surveyed this\narmament with great attention, while the general put the whole in\naction, and conducted their motions by beat of drum. The mussel-shells,\naccording to Minikin’s explanation, represented the transports, the\noyster-shells were considered as the men-of-war that covered the troops\nin landing, and the pieces of card exhibited the different bodies into\nwhich the army was formed upon its disembarkation.\n\nAs an affair of such consequence could not be transacted without\nopposition, they had provided divers ambuscades, consisting of the\nenemy, whom they represented by grey peas; and accordingly General\nMacleaver, perceiving the said grey peas marching along shore to attack\nhis forces before they could be drawn up in battalia, thus addressed\nhimself to the oyster-shells, in an audible voice:—“You men-of-war,\ndon’t you see the front of the enemy advancing, and the rest of the\ndetachment following out of sight? Arrah! the devil burn you, why don’t\nyou come ashore and open your batteries?” So saying, he pushed the\nshells towards the breach, performed the cannonading with his voice,\nthe grey peas were soon put in confusion, the general was beat, the\ncards marched forwards in order of battle, and the enemy having\nretreated with great precipitation, they took possession of their\nground without farther difficulty.\n\nCHAPTER FORTY\n\nHE CONTEMPLATES MAJESTY AND ITS SATELLITES IN ECLIPSE.\n\nThis expedition being happily finished, General Macleaver put the whole\narmy, navy, transports, and scene of action into a canvas bag, the\nprince unsaddled his nose, and Captain Minikin being admitted, our hero\nwas introduced in form. Very gracious was the reception he met with\nfrom his majesty, who, with a most princely demeanour, welcomed him to\ncourt, and even seated him on his right hand, in token of particular\nregard. True it is, this presence-chamber was not so superb, nor the\nappearance of the king so magnificent, as to render such an honour\nintoxicating to any person of our hero’s coolness and discretion. In\nlieu of tapestry, the apartment was hung with halfpenny ballads, a\ntruckle-bed without curtains supplied the place of a canopy, and\ninstead of a crown his majesty wore a woollen night-cap. Yet, in spite\nof these disadvantages, there was an air of dignity in his deportment,\nand a nice physiognomist would have perceived something majestic in the\nfeatures of his countenance.\n\nHe was certainly a personage of very prepossessing mien; his manners\nwere engaging, his conversation agreeable, and any man whose heart was\nsubject to the meltings of humanity would have deplored his distress,\nand looked upon him as a most pathetic instance of that miserable\nreverse to which all human grandeur is exposed. His fall was even\ngreater than that of Belisarius, who, after having obtained many\nglorious victories over the enemies of his country, is said to have\nbeen reduced to such extremity of indigence, that, in his old age, when\nhe was deprived of his eyesight, he sat upon the highway like a common\nmendicant, imploring the charity of passengers in the piteous\nexclamation of Date obolum Belisario; that is, “Spare a farthing to\nyour poor old soldier Belisarius.” I say, this general’s disgrace was\nnot so remarkable as that of Theodore, because he was the servant of\nJustinian, consequently his fortune depended upon the nod of that\nemperor; whereas the other actually possessed the throne of sovereignty\nby the best of all titles, namely, the unanimous election of the people\nover whom he reigned; and attracted the eyes of all Europe, by the\nefforts he made in breaking the bands of oppression, and vindicating\nthat liberty which is the birthright of man.\n\nThe English of former days, alike renowned for generosity and valour,\ntreated those hostile princes, whose fate it was to wear their chains,\nwith such delicacy of benevolence, as even dispelled the horrors of\ncaptivity; but their posterity of this refined age feel no compunction\nat seeing an unfortunate monarch, their former friend, ally, and\npartisan, languish amidst the miseries of a loathsome jail, for a\npaltry debt contracted in their own service. But, moralising apart, our\nhero had not long conversed with this extraordinary debtor, who in his\npresent condition assumed no other title than that of Baron, than he\nperceived in him a spirit of Quixotism, which all his experience,\ntogether with the vicissitudes of his fortune, had not been able to\novercome. Not that his ideas soared to such a pitch of extravagant hope\nas that which took possession of his messmates, who frequently\nquarrelled one with another about the degrees of favour to which they\nshould be entitled after the king’s restoration; but he firmly believed\nthat affairs would speedily take such a turn in Italy, as would point\nout to the English court the expediency of employing him again; and his\npersuasion seemed to support him against every species of poverty and\nmortification.\n\nWhile they were busy in trimming the balance of power on the other side\nof the Alps, their deliberations were interrupted by the arrival of a\nscullion, who came to receive their orders touching the bill of fare\nfor dinner, and his majesty found much more difficulty in settling this\nimportant concern, than in compromising all the differences between the\nEmperor and the Queen of Spain. At length, however, General Macleaver\nundertook the office of purveyor for his prince; Captain Minikin\ninsisted upon treating the Count; and in a little time the table was\ncovered with a cloth, which, for the sake of my delicate readers, I\nwill not attempt to describe.\n\nAt this period they were joined by Sir Mungo Barebones, who, having\nfound means to purchase a couple of mutton chops, had cooked a mess of\nbroth, which he now brought in a saucepan to the general rendezvous.\nThis was the most remarkable object which had hitherto presented itself\nto the eyes of Fathom. Being naturally of a meagre habit, he was, by\nindigence and hard study, wore almost to the bone, and so bended\ntowards the earth, that in walking his body described at least 150\ndegrees of a circle. The want of stockings and shoes he supplied with a\njockey straight boot and an half jack. His thighs and middle were cased\nin a monstrous pair of brown trunk breeches, which the keeper bought\nfor his use from the executor of a Dutch seaman who had lately died in\nthe jail. His shirt retained no signs of its original colour, his body\nwas shrouded in an old greasy tattered plaid nightgown; a blue and\nwhite handkerchief surrounded his head, and his looks betokened that\nimmense load of care which he had voluntarily incurred for the eternal\nsalvation of sinners. Yet this figure, uncouth as it was, made his\ncompliments to our adventurer in terms of the most elegant address,\nand, in the course of conversation, disclosed a great fund of valuable\nknowledge. He had appeared in the great world, and borne divers offices\nof dignity and trust with universal applause. His courage was\nundoubted, his morals were unimpeached, and his person held in great\nveneration and esteem; when his evil genius engaged him in the study of\nHebrew, and the mysteries of the Jewish religion, which fairly\ndisordered his brain, and rendered him incapable of managing his\ntemporal affairs. When he ought to have been employed in the functions\nof his post, he was always wrapt in visionary conferences with Moses on\nthe Mount; rather than regulate the economy of his household, he chose\nto exert his endeavours in settling the precise meaning of the word\nElohim; and having discovered that now the period was come, when the\nJews and Gentiles would be converted, he postponed every other\nconsideration, in order to facilitate that great and glorious event.\n\nBy this time Ferdinand had seen every member of the club, except the\nFrench chevalier, who seemed to be quite neglected by the society; for\nhis name was not once mentioned during this communication, and they sat\ndown to dinner, without asking whether he was dead or alive. The king\nregaled himself with a plate of ox-cheek; the major, who complained\nthat his appetite had forsaken him, amused himself with some forty hard\neggs, malaxed with salt butter; the knight indulged upon his soup and\nbouilli, and the captain entertained our adventurer with a neck of veal\nroasted with potatoes; but before Fathom could make use of his knife\nand fork, he was summoned to the door, where he found the chevalier in\ngreat agitation, his eyes sparkling like coals of fire.\n\nOur hero was not a little surprised at this apparition, who, having\nasked pardon for the freedom he had used, observed, that, understanding\nthe Count was a foreigner, he could not dispense with appealing to him\nconcerning an outrage he had suffered from the keeper, who, without any\nregard to his rank or misfortunes, had been base enough to refuse him\ncredit for a few necessaries, until he could have a remittance from his\nsteward in France; he therefore conjured Count Fathom, as a stranger\nand nobleman like himself, to be the messenger of defiance, which he\nresolved to send to that brutal jailor, that, for the future, he might\nlearn to make proper distinctions in the exercise of his function.\n\nFathom, who had no inclination to offend this choleric Frenchman,\nassured him that he might depend upon his friendship; and, in the\nmeantime, prevailed upon him to accept of a small supply, in\nconsequence of which he procured a pound of sausages, and joined the\nrest of the company without delay; making a very suitable addition to\nsuch an assemblage of rarities. Though his age did not exceed thirty\nyears, his beard, which was of a brindled hue, flowed down, like\nAaron’s, to his middle. Upon his legs he wore red stockings rolled up\nover the joint of the knee, his breeches were of blue drab, with vellum\nbutton-holes, and garters of gold lace, his waistcoat of scarlet, his\ncoat of rusty black cloth, his hair, twisted into a ramilie, hung down\nto his rump, of the colour of jet, and his hat was adorned with a white\nfeather.\n\nThis original had formed many ingenious schemes to increase the glory\nand grandeur of France, but was discouraged by Cardinal Fleury, who, in\nall appearance, jealous of his great talents, not only rejected his\nprojects, but even sent him to prison, on pretence of being offended at\nhis impertinence. Perceiving that, like the prophet, he had no honour\nin his own country, he no sooner obtained his release, than he retired\nto England, where he was prompted by his philanthropy to propose an\nexpedient to our ministry, which would have saved a vast effusion of\nblood and treasure; this was an agreement between the Queen of Hungary\nand the late Emperor, to decide their pretensions by a single combat;\nin which case he offered himself as the Bavarian champion; but in this\nendeavour he also proved unsuccessful. Then turning his attention to\nthe delights of poetry, he became so enamoured of the muse, that he\nneglected every other consideration, and she as usual gradually\nconducted him to the author’s never-failing goal—a place of rest\nappointed for all those sinners whom the profane love of poesy hath led\nastray.\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-ONE\n\nONE QUARREL IS COMPROMISED, AND ANOTHER DECIDED BY UNUSUAL ARMS.\n\nAmong other topics of conversation that were discussed at this genial\nmeeting, Sir Mungo’s scheme was brought upon the carpet by his majesty,\nwho was graciously pleased to ask how his subscription filled? To this\ninterrogation the knight answered, that he met with great opposition\nfrom a spirit of levity and self-conceit, which seemed to prevail in\nthis generation, but that no difficulties should discourage him from\npersevering in his duty; and he trusted in God, that, in a very little\ntime, he should be able to confute and overthrow the false philosophy\nof the moderns, and to restore the writings of Moses to that\npre-eminence and veneration which is due to an inspired author. He\nspoke of the immortal Newton with infinite contempt, and undertook to\nextract from the Pentateuch a system of chronology which would\nascertain the progress of time since the fourth day of the creation to\nthe present hour, with such exactness, that not one vibration of a\npendulum should be lost; nay, he affirmed that the perfection of all\narts and sciences might be attained by studying these secret memoirs,\nand that he himself did not despair of learning from them the art of\ntransmuting baser metals into gold.\n\nThe chevalier, though he did not pretend to contradict these\nassertions, was too much attached to his own religion to acquiesce in\nthe knight’s project of converting the Jews and the Gentiles to the\nProtestant heresy, which, he said, God Almighty would never suffer to\ntriumph over the interests of his own Holy Catholic Church. This\nobjection produced abundance of altercation between two very unequal\ndisputants; and the Frenchman, finding himself puzzled by the learning\nof his antagonist, had recourse to the argumentum ad hominem, by laying\nhis hand upon his sword, and declaring that he was ready to lose the\nlast drop of his blood in opposition to such a damnable scheme.\n\nSir Mungo, though in all appearance reduced to the last stage of animal\nexistence, no sooner heard this epithet applied to his plan, than his\neyes gleamed like lightning, he sprung from his seat with the agility\nof a grasshopper, and, darting himself out at the door like an arrow\nfrom a bow, reappeared in a moment with a long rusty weapon, which\nmight have been shown among a collection of rarities as the sword of\nGuy Earl of Warwick. This implement he brandished over the chevalier’s\nhead with the dexterity of an old prize-fighter, exclaiming, in the\nFrench language, “Thou art a profane wretch marked out for the\nvengeance of Heaven, whose unworthy minister I am, and here thou shalt\nfall by the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.”\n\nThe chevalier, unterrified by this dreadful salutation, desired he\nwould accompany him to a more convenient place; and the world might\nhave been deprived of one or both these knights-errant, had not General\nMacleaver, at the desire of his majesty, interposed, and found means to\nbring matters to an accommodation.\n\nIn the afternoon the society was visited by the major’s cousin and her\ndaughters, who no sooner appeared than they were recognised by our\nadventurer, and his acquaintance with them renewed in such a manner as\nalarmed the delicacy of Captain Minikin, who in the evening repaired to\nthe Count’s apartment, and with a formal physiognomy, accosted him in\nthese words: “Sir, I beg pardon for this intrusion, but I come to\nconsult you about an affair in which my honour is concerned; and a\nsoldier without honour, you know, is no better than a body without a\nsoul. I have always admired that speech of Hotspur in the first part of\nHenry the Fourth:\n\nBy Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,\nTo pluck bright honour from the pale-fac’d moon;\nOr dive into the bottom of the deep,\nWhere fathom-line could never touch the ground,\nAnd pluck up drowned honour by the locks—\n\n“There is a boldness and ease in the expression, and the images are\nvery picturesque. But, without any further preamble, pray, sir, give me\nleave to ask how long you have been acquainted with those ladies who\ndrank tea with us this afternoon. You’ll forgive the question, sir,\nwhen I tell you that Major Macleaver introduced Mrs. Minikin to them as\nto ladies of character, and, I don’t know how, sir, I have a sort of\npresentiment that my wife has been imposed upon. Perhaps I may be\nmistaken, and God grant I may. But there was a je ne sais quoi in their\nbehaviour to-day, which begins to alarm my suspicion. Sir, I have\nnothing but my reputation to depend upon, and I hope you will excuse\nme, when I earnestly beg to know what rank they maintain in life.”\n\nFathom, without minding the consequence, told him, with a simper, that\nhe knew them to be very good-natured ladies, who devoted themselves to\nthe happiness of mankind. This explanation had no sooner escaped from\nhis lips, than the captain’s face began to glow with indignation, his\neyes seemed bursting from their spheres, he swelled to twice his\nnatural dimensions, and, raising himself on his tiptoes, pronounced, in\na strain that emulated thunder, “Blood! sir, you seem to make very\nlight of the matter, but it is no joke to me, I’ll assure you, and\nMacleaver shall see that I am not to be affronted with impunity. Sir, I\nshall take it as a singular favour if you will be the bearer of a\nbillet to him, which I shall write in three words; nay, sir, you must\ngive me leave to insist upon it, as you are the only gentleman of our\nmess whom I can intrust with an affair of this nature.”\n\nFathom, rather than run the risk of disobliging such a punctilious\nwarrior, after having in vain attempted to dissuade him from his\npurpose, undertook to carry the challenge, which was immediately penned\nin these words:\n\n“SIR,\nYou have violated my honour in imposing upon Mrs. Minikin your\npretended cousins as ladies of virtue and reputation. I therefore\ndemand such satisfaction as a soldier ought to receive, and expect you\nwill adjust with my friend Count Fathom the terms upon which you shall\nbe met by the much injured\n\nGOLIAH MINIKIN.”\n\nThis morceau being sealed and directed, was forthwith carried by our\nadventurer to the lodgings of the major, who had by this time retired\nto rest, but hearing the Count’s voice, he got up and opened the door\nin cuerpo, to the astonishment of Ferdinand, who had never before seen\nsuch an Herculean figure. He made an apology for receiving the Count in\nhis birthday suit, to which he said he was reduced by the heat of his\nconstitution, though he might have assigned a more adequate cause, by\nowning that his shirt was in the hands of his washerwoman; then\nshrouding himself in a blanket, desired to know what had procured him\nthe honour of such an extraordinary visit. He read the letter with\ngreat composure, like a man accustomed to such intercourse; then\naddressing himself to the bearer, “I will be after diverting the\ngentleman,” said he, “in any manner he shall think proper; but, by\nJesus, this is no place for such amusements, because, as you well know,\nmy dear Count, if both should be killed by the chance of war, neither\nof us will be able to escape, and after the breath is out of his body,\nhe will make but a sorry excuse to his family and friends. But that is\nno concern of mine, and therefore I am ready to please him in his own\nway.”\n\nFathom approved of his remarks, which he reinforced with sundry\nconsiderations, to the same purpose, and begged the assistance of the\nmajor’s advice, in finding some expedient to terminate the affair\nwithout bloodshed, that no troublesome consequences might ensue either\nto him or to his antagonist, who, in spite of this overstraining\nformality, seemed to be a person of worth and good-nature. “With all my\nheart,” said the generous Hibernian, “I have a great regard for the\nlittle man, and my own character is not to seek at this time of day. I\nhave served a long apprenticeship to fighting, as this same carcase can\ntestify, and if he compels me to run him through the body, by my soul,\nI shall do it in a friendly manner.”\n\nSo saying, he threw aside the blanket, and displayed scars and seams\ninnumerable upon his body, which appeared like an old patched leathern\ndoublet. “I remember,” proceeded this champion, “when I was a slave at\nAlgiers, Murphy Macmorris and I happened to have some difference in the\nbagnio, upon which he bade me turn out. ‘Arra, for what?’ said I; ‘here\nare no weapons that a gentleman can use, and you would not be such a\nnegro as to box like an English carman.’ After he had puzzled himself\nfor some time, he proposed that we should retire into a corner, and\nfunk one another with brimstone, till one of us should give out.\nAccordingly we crammed half a dozen tobacco pipes with sulphur, and,\nsetting foot to foot, began to smoke, and kept a constant fire, until\nMacmorris dropped down; then I threw away my pipe, and taking poor\nMurphy in my arms, ‘What, are you dead?’ said I; ‘if you are dead,\nspeak.’ ‘No, by Jesus!’ cried he, ‘I an’t dead, but I’m speechless.’ So\nhe owned I had obtained the victory, and we were as good friends as\never. Now, if Mr. Minikin thinks proper to put the affair upon the same\nissue, I will smoke a pipe of brimstone with him to-morrow morning, and\nif I cry out first, I will be after asking pardon for this supposed\naffront.”\n\nFathom could not help laughing at the proposal, to which, however, he\nobjected on account of Minikin’s delicate constitution, which might\nsuffer more detriment from breathing in an atmosphere of sulphur than\nfrom the discharge of a pistol, or the thrust of a small sword. He\ntherefore suggested another expedient in lieu of the sulphur, namely,\nthe gum called assafatida, which, though abundantly nauseous, could\nhave no effect upon the infirm texture of the lieutenant’s lungs. This\nhint being relished by the major, our adventurer returned to his\nprincipal, and having repeated the other’s arguments against the use of\nmortal instruments, described the succedaneum which he had concerted\nwith Macleaver. The captain at first believed the scheme was calculated\nfor subjecting him to the ridicule of his fellow-prisoners, and began\nto storm with great violence; but, by the assurances and address of\nFathom, he was at length reconciled to the plan, and preparations were\nmade on each side for this duel, which was actually smoked next day,\nabout noon, in a small closet, detached from the challenger’s\napartment, and within hearing of his majesty, and all his court,\nassembled as witnesses and umpires of the contest.\n\nThe combatants, being locked up together, began to ply their engines\nwith great fury, and it was not long before Captain Minikin perceived\nhe had a manifest advantage over his antagonist. For his organs were\nfamiliarised to the effluvia of this drug, which he had frequently used\nin the course of an hypochondriac disorder; whereas Macleaver, who was\na stranger to all sorts of medicine, by his wry faces and attempts to\npuke, expressed the utmost abhorrence of the smell that invaded his\nnostrils. Nevertheless, resolved to hold out to the last extremity, he\ncontinued in action until the closet was filled with such an\nintolerable vapour as discomposed the whole economy of his entrails,\nand compelled him to disgorge his breakfast in the face of his\nopponent, whose nerves were so disconcerted by this disagreeable and\nunforeseen discharge, that he fell back into his chair in a swoon, and\nthe major bellowed aloud for assistance. The door being opened, he ran\ndirectly to the window, to inhale the fresh air, while the captain,\nrecovering from his fit, complained of Macleaver’s unfair proceeding,\nand demanded justice of the arbitrators, who decided in his favour; and\nthe major being prevailed upon to ask pardon for having introduced Mrs.\nMinikin to women of rotten reputation, the parties were reconciled to\neach other, and peace and concord re-established in the mess.\n\nFathom acquired universal applause for his discreet and humane conduct\nupon this occasion; and that same afternoon had an opportunity of\nseeing the lady in whose cause he had exerted himself. He was presented\nto her as the husband’s particular friend, and when she understood how\nmuch she was indebted to his care and concern for the captain’s safety,\nshe treated him with uncommon marks of distinction; and he found her a\ngenteel, well-bred woman, not without a good deal of personal charms,\nand a well-cultivated understanding.\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-TWO\n\nAN UNEXPECTED RENCONTRE, AND A HAPPY REVOLUTION IN THE AFFAIRS OF OUR\nADVENTURER.\n\nAs she did not lodge within the precincts of this garrison, she was one\nday, after tea, conducted to the gate by the captain and the Count, and\njust as they approached the turnkey’s lodge, our hero’s eyes were\nstruck with the apparition of his old companion Renaldo, son of his\nbenefactor and patron, the Count de Melvil. What were the emotions of\nhis soul, when he saw that young gentleman enter the prison, and\nadvance towards him, after having spoke to the jailor! He never doubted\nthat, being informed of his confinement, he was come to upbraid him\nwith his villany and ingratitude, and he in vain endeavoured to\nrecollect himself from that terror and guilty confusion which his\nappearance had inspired; when the stranger, lifting up his eyes,\nstarted back with signs of extreme amazement, and, after a considerable\npause, exclaimed, “Heaven and earth! Sure my eyes do not deceive me! is\nnot your name Fathom? It is, it must be my old friend and companion,\nthe loss of whom I have so long regretted!” With these words he ran\ntowards our adventurer, and, while he clasped him in his arms with all\nthe eagerness of affection, protested that this was one of the happiest\ndays he had ever seen.\n\nFerdinand, who, from this salutation, concluded himself still in\npossession of Renaldo’s good opinion, was not deficient in expressions\nof tenderness and joy; he returned his embraces with equal ardour, the\ntears trickled down his cheeks, and that perturbation which proceeded\nfrom conscious perfidy and fear, was mistaken by the unsuspecting\nHungarian for the sheer effects of love, gratitude, and surprise. These\nfirst transports having subsided, they adjourned to the lodgings of\nFathom, who soon recollected his spirits and invention so well as to\namuse the other with a feigned tale of his having been taken by the\nFrench, sent prisoner into Champagne, from whence he had written many\nletters to Count Melvil and his son, of whom he could hear no tidings;\nof his having contracted an intimacy with a young nobleman of France,\nwho died in the flower of his age, after having, in token of his\nfriendship, bequeathed to him a considerable legacy; by this he had\nbeen enabled to visit the land of his forefathers in the character of a\ngentleman, which he had supported with some figure, until he was\nbetrayed into a misfortune that exhausted his funds, and drove him to\nthe spot where he was now found. And he solemnly declared, that, far\nfrom forgetting the obligation he owed to Count Melvil, or renouncing\nthe friendship of Renaldo, he had actually resolved to set out for\nGermany on his return to the house of his patron in the beginning of\nthe week posterior to that in which he had been arrested.\n\nYoung Melvil, whose own heart had never known the instigations of\nfraud, implicitly believed the story and protestations of Fathom; and\nthough he would not justify that part of his conduct by which the term\nof his good fortune was abridged, he could not help excusing an\nindiscretion into which he had been hurried by the precipitancy of\nyouth, and the allurements of an artful woman. Nay, with the utmost\nwarmth of friendship, he undertook to wait upon Trapwell, and endeavour\nto soften him into some reasonable terms of composition.\n\nFathom seemed to be quite overwhelmed with a deep sense of all this\ngoodness, and affected the most eager impatience to know the\nparticulars of Renaldo’s fate, since their unhappy separation, more\nespecially his errand to this uncomfortable place, which he should\nhenceforth revere as the providential scene of their reunion. Nor did\nhe forget to inquire, in the most affectionate and dutiful manner,\nabout the situation of his noble parents and amiable sister.\n\nAt mention of these names, Renaldo, fetching a deep sigh, “Alas! my\nfriend,” said he, “the Count is no more; and, what aggravates my\naffliction for the loss of such a father, it was my misfortune to be\nunder his displeasure at the time of his death. Had I been present on\nthat melancholy occasion, so well I knew his generosity and paternal\ntenderness, that, sure I am, he would in his last moments have forgiven\nan only son, whose life had been a continual effort to render himself\nworthy of such a parent, and whose crime was no other than an\nhonourable passion for the most meritorious of her sex. But I was\nremoved at a fatal distance from him, and doubtless my conduct must\nhave been invidiously misrepresented. Be that as it will, my mother has\nagain given her hand in wedlock to Count Trebasi; by whom I have the\nmortification to be informed that I am totally excluded from my\nfather’s succession; and I learn from other quarters, that my sister is\nbarbarously treated by this inhuman father-in-law. Grant, Heaven, I may\nsoon have an opportunity of expostulating with the tyrant upon that\nsubject.”\n\nSo saying, his cheeks glowed, and his eyes lightened with resentment.\nThen he thus proceeded: “My coming hither to-day was with a view to\nvisit a poor female relation, from whom I yesterday received a letter,\ndescribing her most deplorable situation, and soliciting my assistance;\nbut the turnkey affirms that there is no such person in the jail, and I\nwas on my way to consult the keeper, when I was agreeably surprised\nwith the sight of my dear Fathom.”\n\nOur adventurer having wiped from his eyes the tears which were produced\nby the news of his worthy patron’s death, desired to know the name of\nthat afflicted prisoner, in whose behalf he interested himself so much,\nand Renaldo produced the letter, subscribed, “Your unfortunate cousin,\nHelen Melvil.” This pretended relation, after having explained the\ndegree of consanguinity which she and the Count stood in to each other,\nand occasionally mentioned some anecdotes of the family in Scotland,\ngave him to understand that she had married a merchant of London, who,\nby repeated losses in trade, had been reduced to indigence, and\nafterwards confined to prison, where he then lay a breathless corpse,\nhaving left her in the utmost extremity of wretchedness and want, with\ntwo young children in the smallpox, and an incurable cancer in one of\nher own breasts. Indeed, the picture she drew was so moving, and her\nexpressions so sensibly pathetic, that no person, whose heart was not\naltogether callous, could peruse it without emotion. Renaldo had sent\ntwo guineas by the messenger, whom she had represented as a trusty\nservant, whose fidelity had been proof against all the distress of her\nmistress; and he was now arrived in order to reinforce his bounty.\n\nFathom, in the consciousness of his own practices, immediately\ncomprehended the scheme of this letter, and confidently assured him\nthat no such person resided in the prison or in any other place. And\nwhen his friend applied for information to the keeper, these assurances\nwere confirmed; and that stern janitor told him he had been imposed\nupon by a stale trick, which was often practised upon strangers by a\nset of sharpers, who make it their business to pick up hints of\nintelligence relating to private families, upon which they build such\nsuperstructures of fraud and imposition.\n\nHowever piqued the young Hungarian might be to find himself duped in\nthis manner, he rejoiced at the occasion which had thrown Fathom in his\nway; and, after having made him a tender of his purse, took his leave,\non purpose to wait upon Trapwell, who was not quite so untractable as\nan enraged cuckold commonly is; for, by this time, he had accomplished\nthe best part of his aim, which was to be divorced from his wife, and\nwas fully convinced that the defendant was no more than a needy\nadventurer, who, in all probability, would be released by an act of\nparliament for the benefit of insolvent debtors; in which case, he, the\nplaintiff, would reap no solid advantage from his imprisonment.\n\nHe, therefore, listened to the remonstrances of the mediator, and,\nafter much canvassing, agreed to discharge the defendant, in\nconsideration of two hundred pounds, which were immediately paid by\nCount Melvil, who, by this deduction, was reduced to somewhat less than\nthirty.\n\nNevertheless, he cheerfully beggared himself in behalf of his friend,\nfor whose release he forthwith obtained an order; and, next day, our\nadventurer, having bid a formal adieu to his fellows in distress, and,\nin particular, to his majesty, for whose restoration his prayers were\npreferred, he quitted the jail, and accompanied his deliverer, with all\nthe outward marks of unutterable gratitude and esteem.\n\nSurely, if his heart had been made of penetrable stuff, it would have\nbeen touched by the circumstances of this redemption; but had not his\nsoul been invincible to all such attacks, these memoirs would possibly\nnever have seen the light.\n\nWhen they arrived at Renaldo’s lodgings, that young gentleman honoured\nhim with other proofs of confidence and friendship, by giving him a\ncircumstantial detail of all the adventures in which he had been\nengaged after Fathom’s desertion from the imperial camp. He told him,\nthat, immediately after the war was finished, his father had pressed\nhim to a very advantageous match, with which he would have complied,\nthough his heart was not at all concerned, had not he been inflamed\nwith the desire of seeing the world before he could take any step\ntowards a settlement for life. That he had signified his sentiments on\nthis head to the Count, who opposed them with unusual obstinacy, as\nproductive of a delay which might be fatal to his proposal; for which\nreason he had retired incognito from his family, and travelled through\nsundry states and countries, in a disguise by which he eluded the\ninquiries of his parents.\n\nThat, in the course of these peregrinations, he was captivated by the\nirresistible charms of a young lady, on whose heart he had the good\nfortune to make a tender impression. That their mutual love had\nsubjected both to many dangers and difficulties, during which they\nsuffered a cruel separation; after the torments of which, he had\nhappily found her in England, where she now lived entirely cut off from\nher native country and connexions, and destitute of every other\nresource but his honour, love, and protection. And, finally, that he\nwas determined to combat his own desires, how violent soever they might\nbe, until he should have made some suitable provision for the\nconsequences of a stricter union with the mistress of his soul, that he\nmight not, by a precipitate marriage, ruin the person whom he adored.\n\nThis end he proposed to attain, by an application to the court of\nVienna, which he did not doubt would have some regard to his own\nservice, and that of his father; and thither he resolved to repair,\nwith the first opportunity, now that he had found a friend with whom he\ncould intrust the inestimable jewel of his heart.\n\nHe likewise gave our hero to understand, that he had been eight months\nin England, during which he had lived in a frugal manner, that he might\nnot unnecessarily exhaust the money he had been able to raise upon his\nown credit; that, hitherto, he had been obliged to defer his departure\nfor Germany on account of his attendance upon the mother of his\nmistress, who was lately dead of sorrow and chagrin; and that, since he\nresided in London, he had often heard of the celebrated Count Fathom,\nthough he never imagined that his friend Ferdinand could be\ndistinguished by that appellation.\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-THREE\n\nFATHOM JUSTIFIES THE PROVERB, “WHAT’S BRED IN THE BONE WILL NEVER COME\nOUT OF THE FLESH.”\n\nSome circumstances of this conversation made a deep impression upon the\nmind of our adventurer, who nevertheless concealed his emotions from\nthe knowledge of his friend, and was next day introduced to that hidden\ntreasure of which Renaldo had spoken with such rapture and adoration.\nIt was not without reason he had expatiated upon the personal\nattractions of this young lady, whom, for the present, we shall call\nMonimia, a name that implies her orphan situation. When she entered the\nroom, even Fathom, whose eyes had been sated with beauty, was struck\ndumb with admiration, and could scarce recollect himself so far as to\nperform the ceremony of his introduction.\n\nShe seemed to be about the age of eighteen. Her stature was tall; her\nmotion graceful. A knot of artificial flowers restrained the luxuriancy\nof her fine black hair, that flowed in shining ringlets adown her snowy\nneck. The contour of her face was oval; her forehead remarkably high;\nher complexion clean and delicate, though not florid; and her eyes were\nso piercing, as to strike the soul of every beholder. Yet, upon this\noccasion, one half of their vivacity was eclipsed by a languishing air\nof melancholy concern; which, while it in a manner sheathed the edge of\nher beauty, added a most engaging sweetness to her looks. In short,\nevery feature was elegantly perfect; and the harmony of the whole\nravishing and delightful.\n\nIt was easy to perceive the mutual sentiments of the two lovers at\nmeeting, by the pleasure that sensibly diffused itself in the\ncountenances of both. Fathom was received by her as the intimate friend\nof her admirer, whom she had often heard of in terms of the most\nsincere affection; and the conversation was carried on in the Italian\nlanguage, because she was a foreigner who had not as yet made great\nproficiency in the knowledge of the English tongue. Her understanding\nwas such as, instead of diminishing, reinforced the prepossession which\nwas inspired by her appearance; and if the sum-total of her charms\ncould not melt the heart, it at least excited the appetite of Fathom to\nsuch a degree, that he gazed upon her with such violence of desire, as\nhad never transported him before; and he instantly began to harbour\nthoughts, not only destructive to the peace of his generous patron, but\nalso to the prudential maxims he had adopted on his first entrance into\nlife.\n\nWe have already recorded divers instances of his conduct to prove that\nthere was an intemperance in his blood, which often interfered with his\ncaution; and although he had found means to render this heat sometimes\nsubservient to his interest, yet, in all probability, Heaven mingled\nthe ingredient in his constitution, on purpose to counteract his\nconsummate craft, defeat the villany of his intention, and at least\nexpose him to the justice of the law, and the contempt of his\nfellow-creatures.\n\nStimulated as he was by the beauty of the incomparable Monimia, he\nforesaw that the conquest of her heart would cost him a thousand times\nmore labour and address than all the victories he had ever achieved;\nfor, besides her superior understanding, her sentiments of honour,\nvirtue, gratitude, religion, and pride of birth, her heart was already\nengaged by the tenderest ties of love and obligation, to a man whose\nperson and acquired accomplishments at least equalled his own; and\nwhose connexion with him was of such a nature as raised an almost\ninsurmountable bar to his design; because, with what face could he\ncommence rival to the person whose family had raised him from want and\nservility, and whose own generosity had rescued him from the miseries\nof a dreary gaol?\n\nNotwithstanding these reflections, he would not lay aside an idea which\nso agreeably flattered his imagination. He, like every other projector\nin the same circumstances, was so partial to his own qualifications, as\nto think the lady would soon perceive a difference between him and\nRenaldo that could not fail to turn to his advantage in her opinion. He\ndepended a good deal on the levity and inconstancy of the sex; and did\nnot doubt that, in the course of their acquaintance, he should profit\nby that languor which often creeps upon and flattens the intercourse of\nlovers cloyed with the sight and conversation of each other.\n\nThis way of arguing was very natural to a man who had never known other\nmotives than those of sensuality and convenience; and perhaps, upon\nthese maxims, he might have succeeded with nine-tenths of the fair sex.\nBut, for once, he erred in his calculation; Monimia’s soul was perfect,\nher virtue impregnable. His first approaches were, as usual, performed\nby the method of insinuation, which succeeded so well, that in a few\ndays he actually acquired a very distinguished share of her favour and\nesteem. To this he had been recommended, in the warmest strain of\nexaggerating friendship, by her dear Renaldo; so that, placing the most\nunreserved confidence in his honour and integrity, and being almost\nquite destitute of acquaintance, she made no scruple of owning herself\npleased with his company and conversation; and therefore he was never\nabridged in point of opportunity. She had too much discernment to\noverlook his uncommon talents and agreeable address, and too much\nsusceptibility to observe them with indifference. She not only regarded\nhim as the confidant of her lover, but admired him as a person whose\nattachment did honour to Count Melvil’s choice. She found his discourse\nremarkably entertaining, his politeness dignified with an air of\nuncommon sincerity, and she was ravished with his skill in music, an\nart of which she was deeply enamoured.\n\nWhile he thus ingratiated himself with the fair Monimia, Renaldo\nrejoiced at their intimacy, being extremely happy in the thought of\nhaving found a friend who could amuse and protect the dear creature in\nhis absence. That she might be the better prepared for the temporary\nseparation which he meditated, he began to be less frequent in his\nvisits, or rather to interrupt, by gradual intermissions, the constant\nattendance he had bestowed upon her since her mother’s death. This\nalteration she was enabled to bear by the assiduities of Fathom, when\nshe understood that her lover was indispensably employed in negotiating\na sum of money for the purposes of his intended voyage. This was really\nthe case; for, as the reader hath been already informed, the provision\nhe had made for that emergency was expended in behalf of our\nadventurer; and the persons of whom he had borrowed it, far from\napproving of the use to which it was put, and accommodating him with a\nfresh supply, reproached him with his benevolence as an act of\ndishonesty to them; and, instead of favouring this second application,\nthreatened to distress him for what he had already received. While he\nendeavoured to surmount these difficulties, his small reversion was\nquite exhausted, and he saw himself on the brink of wanting the common\nnecessaries of life.\n\nThere was no difficulty which he could not have encountered with\nfortitude, had he alone been concerned. But his affection and regard\nfor Monimia were of such a delicate nature, that, far from being able\nto bear the prospect of her wanting the least convenience, he could not\nendure that she should suspect her situation cost him a moment’s\nperplexity; because he foresaw it would wring her gentle heart with\nunspeakable anguish and vexation. This, therefore, he endeavoured to\nanticipate by expressions of confidence in the Emperor’s equity, and\nfrequent declarations touching the goodness and security of that credit\nfrom which he derived his present subsistence.\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-FOUR\n\nANECDOTES OF POVERTY, AND EXPERIMENTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHOM IT\nMAY CONCERN.\n\nHis affairs being thus circumstanced, it is not to be supposed that he\npassed his time in tranquillity. Every day ushered in new demands and\nfresh anxiety; for though his economy was frugal, it could not be\nsupported without money; and now not only his funds were drained, but\nalso his private friends tired of relieving his domestic necessities;\nnay, they began to relinquish his company, which formerly they had\ncoveted; and those who still favoured him with their company embittered\nthat favour with disagreeable advice, mingled with impertinent reproof.\nThey loudly exclaimed against the last instance of his friendship for\nFathom, as a piece of wrong-headed extravagance, which neither his\nfortune could afford nor his conscience excuse; and alleged that such\nspecimens of generosity are vicious in any man, let his finances be\nnever so opulent, if he has any relations of his own who need his\nassistance; but altogether scandalous, not to say unjust, in a person\nwho depends for his own support on the favour of his friends.\n\nThese expostulations did not even respect the beauteous, the\naccomplished, the gentle-hearted, the orphan Monimia. Although they\nowned her perfections, and did not deny that it would be highly\nmeritorious in any man of fortune to make her happy, they disapproved\nof Renaldo’s attachment to the fair beggar, made light of that intimate\nunion of hearts which subsisted between the two lovers, and which no\nhuman consideration could dissolve; and some among them, in the\nconsummation of their prudence, ventured to hint a proposal of\nproviding for her in the service of some lady of fashion.\n\nAny reader of sensibility will easily conceive how these admonitions\nwere relished by a young gentleman whose pride was indomitable, whose\nnotions of honour were scrupulously rigid and romantic, whose temper\nwas warm, and whose love was intense. Every such suggestion was as a\ndagger to his soul; and what rendered the torture more exquisite, he\nlay under obligations to those very persons whose selfish and sordid\nsentiments he disdained; so that he was restricted by gratitude from\ngiving vent to his indignation, and his forlorn circumstances would not\npermit him to renounce their acquaintance. While he struggled with\nthese mortifications, his wants grew more and more importunate, and his\ncreditors became clamorous.\n\nFathom, to whom all his grievances were disclosed, lamented his hard\nhap with all the demonstrations of sympathy which he could expect to\nfind in such a zealous adherent. He upbraided himself incessantly as\nthe cause of his patron’s distress; took God to witness that he would\nrather have perished in gaol than have enjoyed his liberty, had he\nknown it would have cost his dearest friend and benefactor one-tenth\npart of the anguish he now saw him suffer; and, in conclusion, the\nfervency of his affection glowed to such a degree, that he offered to\nbeg, steal, or plunder on the highway, for Renaldo’s assistance.\n\nCertain it is, he might have recollected a less disagreeable expedient\nthan any of these to alleviate the pangs of this unhappy lover; for, at\nthat very period he was possessed of money and moveables to the amount\nof a much greater sum than that which was necessary to remove the\nseverest pangs of the Count’s misfortune. But, whether he did not\nreflect upon this resource, or was willing to let Melvil be better\nacquainted with adversity, which is the great school of life, I shall\nleave the reader to determine. Yet, so far was he from supplying the\nwants of the young Hungarian, that he did not scruple to receive a\nshare of the miserable pittance which that gentleman made shift to\nextort from the complaisance of a few companions, whose countenance he\nstill enjoyed.\n\nRenaldo’s life was now become a sacrifice to the most poignant\ndistress. Almost his whole time was engrossed by a double scheme,\ncomprehending his efforts to render his departure practicable, and his\nexpedients for raising the means of daily bread. With regard to the\nfirst, he exerted himself among a set of merchants, some of whom knew\nhis family and expectations; and, for the last, he was fain to depend\nupon the assistance of a few intimates, who were not in a condition to\nfurnish him with sums of consequence. These, however, gradually dropped\noff, on pretence of friendly resentment for his indiscreet conduct; so\nthat he found himself naked and deserted by all his former companions,\nexcept one gentleman, with whom he had lived in the most unreserved\ncorrespondence, as with a person of the warmest friendship, and the\nmost unbounded benevolence; nay, he had actually experienced repeated\nproofs of his generosity; and such were the Count’s sentiments of the\ngratitude, love, and esteem, which were due to the author of these\nobligations, that he would have willingly laid down his own life for\nhis interest or advantage. He had already been at different times\naccommodated by this benefactor with occasional supplies, amounting in\nthe whole to about forty or fifty pounds; and so fearful was he of\ntaking any step by which he might forfeit the goodwill of this\ngentleman, that he struggled with unparelleled difficulty and vexation,\nbefore he could prevail upon himself to put his liberality to another\nproof.\n\nWhat maxims of delicacy will not the dire calls of necessity infringe!\nReduced to the alternative of applying once more to that beneficence\nwhich had never failed him, or of seeing Monimia starve, he chose the\nfirst, as of two evils the least, and intrusted Fathom with a letter\nexplaining the bitterness of his case. It was not without trepidation\nthat he received in the evening from his messenger an answer to this\nbillet; but what were his pangs when he learned the contents! The\ngentleman, after having professed himself Melvil’s sincere well-wisher,\ngave him to understand, that he was resolved for the future to detach\nhimself from every correspondence which would be inconvenient for him\nto maintain; that he considered his intimacy with the Count in that\nlight; yet, nevertheless, if his distress was really as great as he had\ndescribed it, he would still contribute something towards his relief;\nand accordingly had sent by the bearer five guineas for that purpose;\nbut desired him to take notice, that, in so doing, he laid himself\nunder some difficulty.\n\nRenaldo’s grief and mortification at this disappointment were\nunspeakable. He now saw demolished the last screen betwixt him and the\nextremity of indigence and woe; he beheld the mistress of his soul\nabandoned to the bleakest scenes of poverty and want; and he deeply\nresented the lofty strain of the letter, by which he conceived himself\ntreated as a worthless spendthrift and importunate beggar. Though his\npurse was exhausted to the last shilling; though he was surrounded with\nnecessities and demands, and knew not how to provide another meal for\nhis fair dependent, he, in opposition to all the suggestions and\neloquence of Fathom, despatched him with the money and another billet,\nintimating, in the most respectful terms, that he approved of his\nfriend’s new-adopted maxim, which, for the future, he should always\ntake care to remember; and that he had sent back the last instance of\nhis bounty, as a proof how little he was disposed to incommode his\nbenefactor.\n\nThis letter, though sincerely meant, and written in a very serious\nmood, the gentleman considered as an ungrateful piece of irony, and in\nthat opinion complained to several persons of the Count’s acquaintance,\nwho unanimously exclaimed against him as a sordid, unthankful, and\nprofligate knave, that abused and reviled those very people who had\ngenerously befriended him, whenever they found it inconvenient to\nnourish his extravagance with further supplies. Notwithstanding these\naccumulated oppressions, he still persevered with fortitude in his\nendeavours to disentangle himself from this maze of misery. To these he\nwas encouraged by a letter which about this time he received from his\nsister, importing, that she had good reason to believe the real will of\nher father had been suppressed for certain sinister views; and desiring\nhim to hasten his departure for Hungary, where he would still find some\nfriends who were both able and willing to support his cause. He had\nsome trinkets left; the pawnbroker’s shop was still open; and hitherto\nhe made shift to conceal from Monimia the extent of his affliction.\n\nThe money-broker whom he employed, after having amused him with a\nvariety of schemes, which served no other purpose than that of\nprotracting his own job, at length undertook to make him acquainted\nwith a set of monied men who had been very venturous in lending sums\nupon personal security; he was therefore introduced to their club in\nthe most favourable manner, after the broker had endeavoured to\nprepossess them separately, with magnificent ideas of his family and\nfortune.—By means of this anticipation he was received with a manifest\nrelaxation of that severity which people of this class mingle in their\naspects to the world in general; and they even vied with each other in\ntheir demonstrations of hospitality and respect; for every one in\nparticular looked upon him as a young heir, who would bleed freely, and\nmortgage at cent. per cent.\n\nRenaldo, buoyed up with these exterior civilities, began to flatter\nhimself with hopes of success, which, however, were soon checked by the\nnature of the conversation; during which the chairman upbraided one of\nthe members in open club for having once lent forty pounds upon slight\nsecurity. The person accused alleged, in his own defence, that the\nborrower was his own kinsman, whose funds he knew to be sufficient;\nthat he had granted his bond, and been at the expense of insuring his\nlife for the money; and, in conclusion, had discharged it to the day\nwith great punctuality. These allegations were not deemed exculpatory\nby the rest of the assembly, who with one voice pronounced him guilty\nof unwarrantable rashness and indiscretion, which, in time coming, must\nundoubtedly operate to the prejudice of his character and credit.\n\nThis was a bitter declaration to the young Count, who nevertheless\nendeavoured to improve the footing he had gained among them, by\ncourting their company, conforming to their manners, and attentively\nlistening to their discourse. When he had cultivated them with great\nassiduity for the space of some weeks, dined at their houses upon\npressing invitations, and received repeated offers of service and\nfriendship, believing that things were now ripe for the purpose, he,\none day, at a tavern to which he had invited him to dinner, ventured to\ndisclose his situation to him whose countenance was the least\nunpromising; and as he introduced the business with a proposal of\nborrowing money, he perceived his eyes sparkle with a visible alacrity,\nfrom which he drew a happy presage. But, alas! this was no more than a\ntransient gleam of sunshine, which was suddenly obumbrated by the\nsequel of his explanation; insomuch, that, when the merchant understood\nthe nature of the security, his visage was involved in a most\ndisagreeable gloom, and his eyes distorted into a most hideous\nobliquity of vision; indeed, he squinted so horribly, that Renaldo was\namazed and almost affrighted at his looks, until he perceived that this\ndistortion proceeded from concern for a silver tobacco box which he had\nlaid down by him on the table, after having filled his pipe. As the\nyouth proceeded to unfold his necessities, the other became gradually\nalarmed for this utensil, to which he darted his eyes askance in this\npreternatural direction, until he had slyly secured it in his pocket.\n\nHaving made this successful conveyance, he shifted his eyes alternately\nfrom the young gentleman to the broker for a considerable pause, during\nwhich he in silence reproached the last for introducing such a beggarly\nvarlet to his acquaintance; then taking the pipe from his mouth, “Sir,”\nsaid he, addressing himself to the Count, “if I had all the inclination\nin the world to comply with your proposal, it is really not in my\npower. My correspondents abroad have remitted such a number of bad\nbills of late, that all my running cash hath been exhausted in\nsupporting their credit. Mr. Ferret, sure I am, you was not ignorant of\nmy situation; and I’m not a little surprised that you should bring the\ngentleman to me on business of this kind; but, as the wise man\nobserves, Bray a fool in a mortar, and he’ll never be wise.” So saying,\nwith a most emphatic glance directed to the broker, he rung the bell,\nand called for the reckoning; when, finding that he was to be the guest\nof Renaldo, he thanked him drily for his good cheer, and in an abrupt\nmanner took himself away.\n\nThough baffled in this quarter, the young gentleman would not despair;\nbut forthwith employed Mr. Ferret in an application to another of the\nsociety; who, after having heard the terms of his commission, desired\nhim to tell his principal, that he could do nothing without the\nconcurrence of his partner, who happened to be at that time in one of\nour American plantations. A third being solicited, excused himself on\naccount of an oath which he had lately taken on the back of a\nconsiderable loss. A fourth being tried, made answer, that it was not\nin his way. And a fifth candidly owned, that he never lent money\nwithout proper security.\n\nThus the forlorn Renaldo tried every experiment without success, and\nnow saw the last ray of hope extinguished. Well-nigh destitute of\npresent support, and encompassed with unrelenting duns, he was obliged\nto keep within doors, and seek some comfort in the conversation of his\ncharming mistress, and his faithful friend; yet, even there, he\nexperienced the extremest rigour of adverse fate. Every rap at the door\nalarmed him with the expectation of some noisy tradesman demanding\npayment. When he endeavoured to amuse himself with drawing, some\nunlucky feature of the occasional portrait recalled the image of an\nobdurate creditor, and made him tremble at the work of his own hands.\nWhen he fled for shelter to the flattering creation of fancy, some\nabhorred idea always started up amidst the gay vision, and dissolved\nthe pleasing enchantment.—Even the seraphic voice of Monimia had no\nlonger power to compose the anxious tumults of his mind. Every song she\nwarbled, every tune she played, recalled to his remembrance some scene\nof love and happiness elapsed; and overwhelmed his soul with the woful\ncomparison of past and present fate. He saw all that was amiable and\nperfect in woman, all that he held most dear and sacred upon earth,\ntottering on the brink of misery, without knowing the danger of her\nsituation, and found himself unable to prevent her fall, or even to\nforewarn her of the peril; for as we have already observed, his soul\ncould not brook the thought of communicating the tidings of distress to\nthe tender-hearted Monimia.\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-FIVE\n\nRENALDO’S DISTRESS DEEPENS, AND FATHOM’S PLOT THICKENS.\n\nSuch aggravated misfortune could not fail to affect his temper and\ndeportment. The continual efforts he made to conceal his vexation\nproduced a manifest distraction in his behaviour and discourse. He\nbegan to be seized with horror at the sight of poor Monimia, whom he\ntherefore shunned as much as the circumstances of their correspondence\nwould allow; and every evening he went forth alone to some solitary\nplace, where he could, unperceived, give a loose to the transports of\nhis sorrow, and in silence meditate some means to lighten the burden of\nhis woe. His heart was sometimes so savaged with despair, which\nrepresented mankind as his inveterate enemies, that he entertained\nthoughts of denouncing war against the whole community, and supplying\nhis own wants with the spoils he should win. At other times he was\ntempted with the desire of putting an end to his miseries and life\ntogether. Yet these were but the transitory suggestions of temporary\nmadness, that soon yielded to the dictates of reason. From the\nexecution of the first he was restrained by his own notions of honour\nand morality; and, from using the other expedient, he was deterred by\nhis love for Monimia, together with the motives of philosophy and\nreligion.\n\nWhile in this manner he secretly nursed the worm of grief that preyed\nupon his vitals, the alteration in his countenance and conduct did not\nescape the eyes of that discerning young lady. She was alarmed at the\nchange, yet afraid to inquire into the source of it; for, being\nignorant of his distress, she could impute it to no cause in which her\nhappiness was not deeply interested. She had observed his strained\ncomplaisance and extraordinary emotion. She had detected him in\nrepeated attempts to avoid her company, and taken notice of his regular\nexcursions in the dark. These were alarming symptoms to a lover of her\ndelicacy and pride. She strove in vain to put the most favourable\nconstruction on what she saw; and, finally, imputed the effects of his\ndespondence to the alienation of his heart. Made miserable beyond\nexpression by these suspicions, she imparted them to Fathom, who, by\nthis time, was in full possession of her confidence and esteem, and\nimplored his advice touching her conduct in such a nice conjuncture.\n\nThis artful politician, who rejoiced at the effect of her penetration,\nno sooner heard himself questioned on the subject, than he gave tokens\nof surprise and confusion, signifying his concern to find she had\ndiscovered what, for the honour of his friend, he wished had never come\nto light. His behaviour on this occasion confirmed her fatal\nconjecture; and she conjured him, in the most pathetic manner, to tell\nher if he thought Renaldo’s heart had contracted any new engagement. At\nthis question, he started with signs of extreme agitation, and stifling\nan artificial sigh, “Sure, madam,” said he, “you cannot doubt the\nCount’s constancy—I am confident—he is certainly—I protest, madam, I am\nso shocked.”\n\nHere he made a full pause, as if the conflict between his integrity and\nhis friendship would not allow him to proceed, and summoned the\nmoisture into either eye—“Then are my doubts removed,” cried the\nafflicted Monimia; “I see your candour in the midst of your attachment\nto Renaldo; and will no longer torment you with impertinent\ninterrogations and vain complaints.” With these words, a flood of tears\ngushed from her enchanting eyes, and she instantly withdrew into her\nown apartment, where she indulged her sorrow to excess. Nor was her\ngrief unanimated with resentment. She was by birth, nature, and\neducation inspired with that dignity of pride which ennobles the human\nheart; and this, by the circumstance of her present dependence, was\nrendered extremely jealous and susceptible; insomuch that she could not\nbrook the least shadow of indifference, much less an injury of such a\nnature, from the man whom she had honoured with her affections, and for\nwhom she had disobliged and deserted her family and friends.\n\nThough her love was so unalterably fixed on this unhappy youth, that,\nwithout the continuation of reciprocal regard, her life would have\nbecome an unsupportable burden, even amidst all the splendour of\naffluence and pomp; and although she foresaw, that, when his protection\nshould cease, she must be left a wretched orphan in a foreign land,\nexposed to all the miseries of want; yet, such was the loftiness of her\ndispleasure, that she disdained to complain, or even demand an\nexplanation from the supposed author of her wrongs.\n\nWhile she continued undetermined in her purpose, and fluctuating on\nthis sea of torture, Fathom, believing that now was the season for\nworking upon her passions, while they were all in commotion, became, if\npossible, more assiduous than ever about the fair mourner, modelled his\nfeatures into a melancholy cast, pretended to share her distress with\nthe most emphatic sympathy, and endeavoured to keep her resentment\nglowing by cunning insinuations, which, though apparently designed to\napologise for his friend, served only to aggravate the guilt of his\nperfidy and dishonour. This pretext of friendly concern is the most\neffectual vehicle for the conveyance of malice and slander; and a man’s\nreputation is never so mortally stabbed, as when the assassin begins\nwith the preamble of, “For my own part, I can safely say that no man\nupon earth has a greater regard for him than I have; and it is with the\nutmost anguish and concern that I see him misbehave in such a manner.”\nThen he proceeds to mangle his character, and the good-natured hearers,\nconcluding he is even blacker than he is represented, on the\nsupposition that the most atrocious circumstances are softened or\nsuppressed by the tenderness or friendship of the accuser, exclaim,\n“Good lack! what a wretch he must be, when his best friends will no\nlonger attempt to defend him!” Nay, sometimes these well-wishers\nundertake his defence, and treacherously betray the cause they have\nespoused, by omitting the reasons that may be urged in his vindication.\n\nBoth these methods were practised by the wily Ferdinand, according to\nthe predominant passion of Monimia. When her indignation prevailed, he\nexpatiated upon his love and sincere regard for Renaldo, which, he\nsaid, had grown up from the cradle, to such a degree of fervour, that\nhe would willingly part with life for his advantage. He shed tears for\nhis apostasy; but every drop made an indelible stain upon his\ncharacter; and, in the bitterness of his grief, swore, notwithstanding\nhis fondness for Renaldo, which had become a part of his constitution,\nthat the young Hungarian deserved the most infamous destiny for having\ninjured such perfection. At other times, when he found her melted into\nsilent sorrow, he affected to excuse the conduct of his friend. He\ninformed her, that the young gentleman’s temper had been uneven from\nhis infancy; that frailty was natural to man; that he might in time be\nreclaimed by self-conviction; he even hinted, that she might have\nprobably ascribed to inconstancy, what was really the effect of some\nchagrin which he industriously concealed from his participation. But,\nwhen he found her disposed to listen to this last suggestion, he\ndestroyed the force of it, by recollecting the circumstances of his\nnocturnal rambles, which, he owned, would admit of no favourable\nconstruction.\n\nBy these means he blew the coals of her jealousy, and enhanced the\nvalue of his own character at the same time; for she looked upon him as\na mirror of faith and integrity, and the mind being overcharged with\nwoe, naturally seeks some confidant, upon whose sympathy it can repose\nitself. Indeed, his great aim was to make himself necessary to her\naffliction, and settle a gossiping correspondence, in the familiarity\nof which he hoped his purpose would certainly be answered.\n\nYet the exertion of these talents was not limited to her alone. While\nhe laid these trains for the hapless young lady, he was preparing\nsnares of another kind for her unsuspecting lover, who, for the\ncompletion of his misery, about this time began to perceive marks of\ndisquiet and displeasure in the countenance and deportment of his\nadored Monimia. For that young lady, in the midst of her grief,\nremembered her origin, and over her vexation affected to throw a veil\nof tranquillity, which served only to give an air of disgust to her\ninternal disturbance.\n\nRenaldo, whose patience and philosophy were barely sufficient to bear\nthe load of his other evils, would have been quite overwhelmed with the\nadditional burden of Monimia’s woe, if it had not assumed this\nappearance of disesteem, which, as he knew he had not deserved it,\nbrought his resentment to his assistance. Yet this was but a wretched\ncordial to support him against the baleful reflections that assaulted\nhim from every quarter; it operated like those desperate remedies,\nwhich, while they stimulate exhausted nature, help to destroy the very\nfundamentals of the constitution. He reviewed his own conduct with the\nutmost severity, and could not recollect one circumstance which could\njustly offend the idol of his soul. The more blameless he appeared to\nhimself in this examination, the less excusable did her behaviour\nappear. He tasked his penetration to discover the cause of this\nalteration; he burned with impatience to know it; his discernment\nfailed him, and he was afraid, though he knew not why, to demand an\nexplanation. His thoughts were so circumstanced, that he durst not even\nunbosom himself to Fathom, though his own virtue and friendship\nresisted those sentiments that began to intrude upon his mind, with\nsuggestions to the prejudice of our adventurer’s fidelity.\n\nNevertheless, unable to endure the torments of such interesting\nsuspense, he at length made an effort to expostulate with the fair\norphan; and in an abrupt address, the effect of his fear and confusion,\nbegged to know if he had inadvertently done anything to incur her\ndispleasure. Monimia, hearing herself bluntly accosted in this unusual\nstrain, after repeated instances of his reserve and supposed\ninconstancy, considered the question as a fresh insult, and, summoning\nher whole pride to her assistance, replied, with affected tranquillity,\nor rather with an air of scorn, that she had no title to judge, neither\ndid she pretend to condemn his conduct. This answer, so wide of that\ntenderness and concern which had hitherto manifested itself in the\ndisposition of his amiable mistress, deprived him of all power to carry\non the conversation, and he retired with a low bow, fully convinced of\nhis having irretrievably lost the place he had possessed in her\naffection; for, to his imagination, warped and blinded by his\nmisfortunes, her demeanour seemed fraught, not with a transient gleam\nof anger, which a respectful lover would soon have appeased, but with\nthat contempt and indifference which denote a total absence of\naffection and esteem. She, on the other hand, misconstrued his sudden\nretreat; and now they beheld the actions of each other through the\nfalse medium of prejudice and resentment. To such fatal\nmisunderstandings the peace and happiness of whole families often fall\na sacrifice.\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-SIX\n\nOUR ADVENTURER BECOMES ABSOLUTE IN HIS POWER OVER THE PASSIONS OF HIS\nFRIEND, AND EFFECTS ONE HALF OF HIS AIM.\n\nInfluenced by this dire mistake, the breast of those unhappy lovers\nbegan to be invaded with the horrors of jealousy. The tender-hearted\nMonimia endeavoured to devour her griefs in silence; she in secret\nbemoaned her forlorn fate without ceasing; her tears flowed without\nintermission from night to morn, and from morn to night. She sought not\nto know the object for which she was forsaken; she meant not to upbraid\nher undoer; her aim was to find a sequestered corner, in which she\ncould indulge her sorrow; where she could brood over the melancholy\nremembrance of her former felicity; where she could recollect those\nhappy scenes she had enjoyed under the wings of her indulgent parents,\nwhen her whole life was a revolution of pleasures, and she was\nsurrounded with affluence, pomp, and admiration; where she could,\nunmolested, dwell upon the wretched comparison between her past and\npresent condition, and paint every circumstance of her misery in the\nmost aggravating colours, that they might make the deeper impression\nupon her mind, and the more speedily contribute to that dissolution for\nwhich she ardently wished, as a total release from woe.\n\nAmidst these pinings, she began to loathe all sustenance; her cheeks\ngrew wan, her bright eyes lost their splendour, the roses vanished from\nher lips, and her delicate limbs could hardly support their burden; in\na word, her sole consolation was limited to the prospect of depositing\nher sorrows in the grave; and her only wish was to procure a retreat in\nwhich she might wait with resignation for that happy period. Yet this\nmelancholy comfort she could not obtain without the advice and\nmediation of Fathom, whom she therefore still continued to see and\nconsult. While these consultations were held, Renaldo’s bosom was\nravaged with tempests of rage and distraction. He believed himself\nsuperseded in the affection of his mistress, by some favoured rival,\nwhose success rankled at his soul; and though he scarce durst\ncommunicate the suspicion to his own heart, his observation continually\nwhispered to him that he was supplanted by his friend Fathom; for\nMonimia was totally detached from the conversation of every other man,\nand he had of late noted their intercourse with distempered eyes.\n\nThese considerations sometimes transported him to such a degree of\nfrenzy, that he was tempted to sacrifice them both as traitors to\ngratitude, friendship, and love; but such deliriums soon vanished\nbefore his honour and humanity. He would not allow himself to think\namiss of Ferdinand, until some undoubted mark of his guilt should\nappear; and this was so far from being the case, that hitherto there\nwas scarce a presumption. “On the contrary,” said he to himself, “I am\nhourly receiving proofs of his sympathy and attachment. Not but that he\nmay be the innocent cause of my mishap. His superior qualifications may\nhave attracted the eye, and engaged the heart of that inconstant fair,\nwithout his being sensible of the victory he has won; or, perhaps,\nshocked at the conquest he hath unwillingly made, he discourages her\nadvances, tries to reason down her unjustifiable passion, and in the\nmeantime conceals from me the particulars, out of regard to my\nhappiness and quiet.”\n\nUnder cover of these favourable conjectures, our adventurer securely\nprosecuted his scheme upon the unfortunate Monimia. He dedicated\nhimself wholly to her service and conversation, except at those times\nwhen his company was requested by Renaldo, who now very seldom exacted\nhis attendance. In his ministry about the person of the beauteous\norphan, this cunning incendiary mingled such awful regard, such melting\ncompassion, as effectually screened him from the suspicion of\ntreachery, while he widened the fatal breach between her and her lover\nby the most diabolical insinuations. He represented his friend as a\nvoluptuary, who gratified his own appetite without the least regard to\nhonour or conscience; and, with a show of infinite reluctance, imparted\nsome anecdotes of his sensuality, which he had feigned for the purpose;\nthen he would exclaim in an affected transport, “Gracious Heaven! is it\npossible for any man who has the least title to perception or humanity\nto injure such innocence and perfection! for my own part, had I been so\nundeservedly happy—Heaven and earth! forgive my transports, madam, I\ncannot help seeing and admiring such divine attractions. I cannot help\nresenting your wrongs; it is the cause of virtue I espouse; it ought to\nbe the cause of every honest man.”\n\nHe had often repeated such apostrophes as these, which she ascribed to\nnothing else than sheer benevolence and virtuous indignation, and\nactually began to think he had made some impression upon her heart, not\nthat he now entertained the hope of an immediate triumph over her\nchastity. The more he contemplated her character, the more difficult\nthe conquest seemed to be: he therefore altered his plan, and resolved\nto carry on his operations under the shelter of honourable proposals,\nforeseeing that a wife of her qualifications, if properly managed,\nwould turn greatly to the account of the husband, or, if her virtue\nshould prove refractory, that he could at any time rid himself of the\nencumbrance, by decamping without beat of drum, after he should be\ncloyed with possession.\n\nElevated by these expectations, he one day, in the midst of a\npreconcerted rhapsody, importing that he could no longer conceal the\nfire that preyed upon his heart, threw himself on his knees before the\nlovely mourner, and imprinted a kiss on her fair hand. Though he did\nnot presume to take this liberty till after such preparation as he\nthought had altogether extinguished her regard for Melvil, and paved\nthe way for his own reception in room of that discarded lover, he had\nso far overshot his mark, that Monimia, instead of favouring his\ndeclaration, started up, and retired in silence, her cheeks glowing\nwith shame, and her eyes gleaming with indignation.\n\nFerdinand no sooner recovered from the confusion produced by this\nunexpected repulse, than he saw the necessity of coming to a speedy\ndetermination, lest the offended fair one should appeal to Renaldo, in\nwhich case they might be mutually undeceived, to his utter shame and\nconfusion; he therefore resolved to deprecate her anger by humble\nsupplications, and by protesting, that, whatever tortures he might\nsuffer by suppressing his sentiments, she should never again be\noffended with a declaration of his passion.\n\nHaving thus appeased the gentle Monimia, and discovered that, in spite\nof her resentment, his friend still kept possession of her heart, he\ndetermined to work an effectual separation, so as that the young lady,\nbeing utterly deserted by Melvil, should be left altogether in his\npower. With this Christian intention, he began to sadden his visage\nwith a double shade of pensive melancholy, in the presence of Renaldo,\nto stifle a succession of involuntary sighs, to answer from the\npurpose, to be incoherent in his discourse, and, in a word, to act the\npart of a person wrapt up in sorrowful cogitation.\n\nCount Melvil, soon as he perceived these symptoms, very kindly inquired\ninto the cause of them, and was not a little alarmed to hear the artful\nand evasive answers of Ferdinand, who, without disclosing the source of\nhis disquiet, earnestly begged leave to retire into some other corner\nof the world. Roused by this entreaty, the Hungarian’s jealousy awoke,\nand with violent agitation, he exclaimed, “Then are my fears too true,\nmy dear Fathom: I comprehend the meaning of your request. I have for\nsome time perceived an host of horrors approaching from that quarter. I\nknow your worth and honour. I depend upon your friendship, and conjure\nyou, by all the ties of it, to free me at once from the most miserable\nsuspense, by owning you have involuntarily captivated the heart of that\nunhappy maiden.”\n\nTo this solemn interrogation he made no reply, but shedding a flood of\ntears, of which he had always a magazine at command, he repeated his\ndesire of withdrawing, and took God to witness, that what he proposed\nwas solely for the quiet of his honoured patron and beloved friend.\n“Enough,” cried the unfortunate Renaldo, “the measure of my woes is now\nfilled up.” So saying, he fell backwards in a swoon, from which he was\nwith difficulty recovered to the sensation of the most exquisite\ntorments. During this paroxysm, our adventurer nursed him with infinite\ncare and tenderness, he exhorted him to summon all his fortitude to his\nassistance, to remember his forefathers, and exert himself in the\nimitation of their virtues, to fly from those bewitching charms which\nhad enslaved his better part, to retrieve his peace of mind by\nreflecting on the inconstancy and ingratitude of woman, and amuse his\nimagination in the pursuit of honour and glory.\n\nAfter these admonitions he abused his ears with a forged detail of the\ngradual advances made to him by Monimia, and the steps he had taken to\ndiscourage her addresses, and re-establish her virtue, poisoning the\nmind of that credulous youth to such a degree, that, in all\nprobability, he would have put a fatal period to his own existence, had\nnot Fathom found means to allay the rage of his ecstasy, by the cunning\narrangement of opposite considerations. He set his pride against his\nlove, he opposed his resentment to his sorrow, and his ambition to his\ndespair. Notwithstanding the balance of power so settled among these\nantagonists, so violent were the shocks of their successive conflicts,\nthat his bosom fared like a wretched province, harassed, depopulated,\nand laid waste, by two fierce contending armies. From this moment his\nlife was nothing but an alternation of starts and reveries; he wept and\nraved by turns, according to the prevailing gust of passion; food\nbecame a stranger to his lips, and sleep to his eyelids; he could not\nsupport the presence of Monimia, her absence increased the torture of\nhis pangs; and, when he met her by accident, he started back with\nhorror, like a traveller who chances to tread upon a snake.\n\nThe poor afflicted orphan, worn to a shadow with self-consuming\nanguish, eager to find some lowly retreat, where she could breath out\nher soul in peace, and terrified at the frantic behaviour of Renaldo,\ncommunicated to Fathom her desire of removing, and begged that he would\ntake a small picture of her father, decorated with diamonds, and\nconvert them into money, for the expense of her subsistence. This was\nthe last pledge of her family, which she had received from her mother,\nwho had preserved it in the midst of numberless distresses, and no\nother species of misery but that which she groaned under could have\nprevailed upon the daughter to part with it; but, exclusive of other\nmotives, the very image itself, by recalling to her mind the honours of\nher name, upbraided her with living in dependence upon a man who had\ntreated her with such indignity and ingratitude; besides, she flattered\nherself with the hope that she should not long survive the loss of this\ntestimonial.\n\nOur adventurer, with many professions of sorrow and mortification at\nhis own want of capacity to prevent such an alienation, undertook to\ndispose of it to the best advantage, and to provide her with a cheap\nand retired apartment, to which he would conduct her in safety, though\nat the hazard of his life. In the meantime, however, he repaired to his\nfriend Renaldo, and, after having admonished him to arm his soul with\npatience and philosophy, declared that Monimia’s guilty passion for\nhimself could no longer be kept within bounds, that she had conjured\nhim, in the most pressing manner, to assist her in escaping from an\nhouse which she considered as the worst of dungeons, because she was in\nit daily exposed to the sight and company of a man whom she detested,\nand that she had bribed him to compliance with her request, not only\nwith repeated promises of eternal love and submission, but also with\nthe picture of her father set with diamonds, which she had hitherto\nreserved as the last and greatest testimony of her affection and\nesteem.\n\nWith these words he presented the fatal pledge to the eyes of the\nastonished youth, upon whom it operated like the poisonous sight of the\nbasilisk, for in an instant, the whole passions of his soul were in the\nmost violent agitation. “What!” cried he, in an ecstasy of rage, “is\nshe so abandoned to perfidy, so lost to shame, so damned to constancy,\nto gratitude, and virtuous love, as to meditate the means of leaving me\nwithout decency, without remorse! to forsake me in my adversity, when\nmy hapless fortune can no longer flatter the pride and vanity of her\nexpectation! O woman! woman! woman! what simile shall I find to\nillustrate the character of the sex? But I will not have recourse to\nvain complaints and feeble exclamations. By Heaven! she shall not\n’scape, she shall not triumph in her levity, she shall not exult in my\ndistress; no! I will rather sacrifice her to my just resentment, to the\ninjured powers of love and friendship. I will act the avenging minister\nof Heaven! I will mangle that fair bosom, which contains so false a\nheart! I will tear her to pieces, and scatter those beauteous limbs as\na prey to the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the air!”\n\nFathom, who expected this storm, far from attempting to oppose its\nprogress, waited with patience until its first violence was overblown;\nthen, assuming an air of condolence, animated with that resolution\nwhich a friend ought to maintain on such occasions, “My dear Count,”\nsaid he, “I am not at all surprised at your emotion, because I know\nwhat an heart, susceptible as yours, must feel from the apostasy of one\nwho has reigned so long the object of your love, admiration, and\nesteem. Your endeavours to drive her from your thoughts must create an\nagony much more severe than that which divorces the soul from the body.\nNevertheless, I am so confident of your virtue and your manhood, as to\nforesee, that you will allow the fair Monimia to execute that\nresolution which she hath so unwisely taken, to withdraw herself from\nyour love and protection. Believe me, my best friend and benefactor,\nthis is a step, in consequence of which you will infallibly retrieve\nyour peace of mind. It may cost you many bitter pangs, it may probe\nyour wounds to the quick; but those pangs will be soothed by the gentle\nand salutary wing of time, and that probing will rouse you to a due\nsense of your own dignity and importance, which will enable you to\nconvert your attention to objects far more worthy of your\ncontemplation. All the hopes of happiness you had cherished in the\npossession of Monimia are now irrecoverably blasted; her heart is now\ndebased beneath your consideration; her love is, without all doubt,\nextinguished, and her honour irretrievably lost; insomuch, that, were\nshe to profess sorrow for her indiscretion, and implore your\nforgiveness, with the most solemn promises of regarding you for the\nfuture with unalterable fidelity and affection, you ought not to\nrestore her to that place in your heart which she hath so meanly\nforfeited, because you could not at the same time reinstate her in the\npossession of that delicate esteem without which there is no harmony,\nno rapture, no true enjoyment in love.\n\n“No, my dear Renaldo, expel the unworthy tenant from your bosom; allow\nher to fill up the measure of her ingratitude, by deserting her lover,\nfriend, and benefactor. Your glory demands her dismission; the world\nwill applaud your generosity, and your own heart approve of your\nconduct. So disencumbered, let us exert ourselves once more in\npromoting your departure from this island, that you may revisit your\nfather’s house, do justice to yourself and amiable sister, and take\nvengeance on the author of your wrongs; then dedicate yourself to\nglory, in imitation of your renowned ancestors, and flourish in the\nfavour of your imperial patron.”\n\nThese remonstrances had such an effect upon the Hungarian, that his\nface was lighted up with a transient gleam of satisfaction. He embraced\nFerdinand with great ardour, calling him his pride, his Mentor, his\ngood genius, and entreated him to gratify the inclination of that\nfickle creature so far as to convey her to another lodging, without\nloss of time, while he would, by absenting himself, favour their\nretreat.\n\nOur hero having obtained this permission, went immediately to the\nskirts of the town, where he had previously bespoke a small, though\nneat apartment, at the house of an old woman, widow of a French\nrefugee. He had already reconnoitred the ground, by sounding his\nlandlady, from whose poverty and complaisance he found reason to expect\nall sorts of freedom and opportunity for the accomplishment of his aim\nupon Monimia’s person. The room being prepared for her reception, he\nreturned to that disconsolate beauty, to whom he presented ten guineas,\nwhich he pretended to have raised by pledging the picture, though he\nhimself acted as the pawnbroker on this occasion, for a very plain and\nobvious reason.\n\nThe fair orphan was overjoyed to find her wish so speedily\naccomplished. She forthwith packed up her necessaries in a trunk; and a\nhackney-coach was called in the dusk of the evening, in which she\nembarked with her baggage and conductor.\n\nYet she did not leave the habitation of Renaldo without regret. In the\ninstant of parting, the idea of that unfortunate youth was associated\nwith every well-known object that presented itself to her eyes; not as\nan inconstant, ungenerous, and perjured swain, but as the accomplished,\nthe virtuous, the melting lover, who had captivated her virgin heart.\nAs Fathom led her to the door, she was met by Renaldo’s dog, which had\nlong been her favourite; and the poor animal fawning upon her as she\npassed, her heart was overwhelmed with such a gush of tenderness, that\na flood of tears streamed down her cheeks, and she had well-nigh sunk\nupon the floor.\n\nFerdinand, considering this emotion as the last tribute she would pay\nto Renaldo, hurried her into the coach, where she soon recovered her\ncomposure; and in a little time he ushered her into the house of Madam\nla Mer, by whom she was received with great cordiality, and conducted\nto her apartment, with which she found no other fault than that of its\nbeing too good for one in her forlorn situation. Here, while the tear\nof gratitude started in either eye, she thanked our adventurer for his\nbenevolence and kind concern, assuring him, that she would not fail\nduly to beseech the Most High to shower down blessings upon him, as the\norphan’s friend and protector.\n\nFathom was not deficient in those expressions that were best adapted to\nher present turn of mind. He observed, that what he had done was in\nobedience to the dictates of common humanity, which would have prompted\nhim to assist any fellow-creature in distress; but that her peculiar\nvirtue and qualifications were such as challenged the utmost exertion\nof his faculties in her service. He said, that surely Heaven had not\ncreated such perfection in vain; that she was destined to receive as\nwell as to communicate happiness; and that the Providence, which she so\npiously adored, would not fail, in due season, to raise her from\ndistress and affliction, to that honour and felicity for which she was\ncertainly ordained. In the meantime, he entreated her to depend upon\nhis service and fidelity, and the article of her board being settled,\nhe left her to the company and consolation of her discreet hostess, who\nsoon insinuated herself into the good opinion of her beauteous lodger.\n\nWhile our hero was employed in this transaction, Renaldo sallied forth\nin a sort of intoxication, which Fathom’s admonitions had inspired;\nand, repairing to a certain noted coffee-house, engaged at chess with\nan old French refugee, that his attention, by being otherwise employed,\nmight not stray towards that fatal object which he ardently wished to\nforget. But, unluckily for him, he had scarce performed three moves of\nthe game, when his ears were exposed to a dialogue between two young\ngentlemen, one of whom asked the other if he would go and see the\n“Orphan” acted at one of the theatres; observing, as a farther\ninducement, that the part of Monimia would be performed by a young\ngentlewoman who had never appeared on the stage. At mention of that\nname, Renaldo started; for though it did not properly belong to his\norphan, it was the appellation by which she had been distinguished ever\nsince her separation from her father’s house, and therefore it recalled\nher to his imagination in the most interesting point of view. Though he\nendeavoured to expel the image, by a closer application to his play,\nevery now and then it intruded upon his fancy, and at each return made\na stronger impression; so that he found himself in the situation of an\nunfortunate bark stranded upon some hidden rock, which, when the wind\nbegins to blow, feels every succeeding wave more boisterous than the\nformer, until, with irresistible fury, they surmount her deck, sweep\neverything before them, and dash her all to pieces.\n\nThe refugee had observed his first emotion, which he attributed to an\nunforeseen advantage he himself had gained over the Hungarian; but\nseeing him, in the sequel, bite his lip, roll his eyes, groan, writhe\nhis body, ejaculate incoherent curses, and neglect his game, the\nHuguenot concluded that he was mad, and being seized with terror and\ndismay, got up and scampered off, without ceremony or hesitation.\n\nMelvil, thus left to the horrors of his own thought, which tortured him\nwith the apprehension of losing Monimia for ever, could no longer\ncombat that suggestion, but ran homewards with all the speed he could\nexert, in order to prevent her retreat. When he crossed the threshold,\nhe was struck with such a damp of presaging fear, that he durst not in\nperson approach her apartment, nor even, by questioning the servant,\ninform himself of the particulars he wanted to know. Yet his suspense\nbecoming more insupportable than his fear, he rushed from room to room\nin quest of that which was not to be found; and, seeing Monimia’s\nchamber door open, entered the deserted temple in a state of\ndistraction, calling aloud upon her name. All was silent, solitary, and\nwoful. “She is gone,” he cried, shedding a flood of tears, “she is for\never lost; and all my hopes of happiness are fled!”\n\nSo saying, he sunk upon that couch on which Monimia had oft reposed,\nand abandoned himself to all the excess of grief and despondence. In\nthis deplorable condition he was found by our adventurer, who gently\nchid him for his want of resolution, and again repelled his sorrow, by\narousing his resentment against the innocent cause of his disquiet,\nhaving beforehand forged the particulars of provocation.\n\n“Is it possible,” said he, “that Renaldo can still retain the least\nsentiment of regard for a fickle woman, by whom he has been so\nungratefully forsaken and so unjustly scorned? Is it possible he can be\nso disturbed by the loss of a creature who is herself lost to all\nvirtue and decorum?—Time and reflection, my worthy friend, will cure\nyou of that inglorious malady. And the future misconduct of that\nimprudent damsel will, doubtless, contribute to the recovery of your\npeace. Her behaviour, at leaving the house where she had received so\nmany marks of the most delicate affection, was in all respects so\nopposite to honour and decency, that I could scarce refrain from\ntelling her I was shocked at her deportment, even while she loaded me\nwith protestations of love. When a woman’s heart is once depraved, she\nbids adieu to all restraint;—she preserves no measures. It was not\nsimply contempt which she expressed for Renaldo; she seems to resent\nhis being able to live under her disdain; and that resentment stoops to\nobjects unworthy of indignation. Even your dog was not exempted from\nthe effects of her displeasure. For, in her passage to the door, she\nkicked the poor animal as one of your dependents; and, in our way to\nthe apartment I had provided for her, she entertained me with a\nludicrous comment upon the manner in which you first made her\nacquainted with your passion. All that modesty of carriage, all that\nchastity of conversation, all that dignity of grief, which she knew so\nwell how to affect, is now entirely laid aside, and, when I quitted\nher, she seemed the most gay, giddy, and impertinent of her sex.”\n\n“Gracious powers!” exclaimed Renaldo, starting from the couch, “am I\nunder the delusion of a dream; or are these things really so, as my\nfriend has represented them? Such a total and sudden degeneracy is\namazing! is monstrous and unnatural!”\n\n“Such, my dear Count,” replied our hero, “is the caprice of a female\nheart, fickle as the wind, uncertain as a calm at sea, fixed to no\nprinciple, but swayed by every fantastic gust of passion, or of whim.\nCongratulate yourself, therefore, my friend, upon your happy\ndeliverance from such a domestic plague—upon the voluntary exile of a\ntraitor from your bosom.—Recollect the dictates of your duty, your\ndiscretion, and your glory, and think upon the honours and elevated\nenjoyment for which you are certainly ordained. To-night let us over a\ncheerful bottle anticipate your success; and to-morrow I will accompany\nyou to the house of an usurer, who, I am informed, fears no risk,\nprovided twenty per cent be given, and the borrower’s life insured.”\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN\n\nTHE ART OF BORROWING FURTHER EXPLAINED, AND AN ACCOUNT OF A STRANGE\nPHENOMENON.\n\nIn this manner did the artful incendiary work upon the passions of the\ncredulous unsuspecting Hungarian, who pressed him to his breast with\nthe most cordial expressions of friendship, calling him his guardian,\nhis saviour, his second father, and gave himself up wholly to his\nadvice.\n\nNext morning, according to the plan they had laid overnight, they\nrepaired to a tavern in the neighbourhood of the person to whom our\nadventurer had been directed, and were fortunate enough to find him in\nthe house, transacting a money affair with a young gentleman who\ntreated him with his morning’s whet.\n\nThat affair being negotiated, he adjourned into another room with\nRenaldo and his companion, who were not a little surprised to see this\nminister of Plutus in the shape of a young sprightly beau, trimmed up\nin all the foppery of the fashion; for they had hitherto always\nassociated with the idea of an usurer old age and rusty apparel. After\ndivers modish congees, he begged to know to what he should attribute\nthe honour of their message; when Ferdinand, who acted the orator, told\nhim, that his friend Count Melvil, having occasion for a sum of money,\nhad been directed to a gentleman of his name, “and, I suppose,” added\nhe, “you are the son of the person with whom the affair is to be\nnegotiated.”\n\n“Sir,” said this petit-maitre, with a smile, “I perceive you are\nsurprised to see one of my profession in the appearance of a gentleman;\nand perhaps your wonder will not cease, when I tell you, that my\neducation was liberal, and that I once had the honour to bear a\ncommission in the British army. I was indeed a first lieutenant of\nmarines, and will venture to say, that no officer in the service was\nmore delicate than myself in observing all the punctilios of honour. I\nentertained the utmost contempt for all the trading part of the nation,\nand suffered myself to be run through the body in a duel, rather than\nroll with a brother-lieutenant, who was a broker’s son. But, thank\nHeaven! I have long ago conquered all those ridiculous prejudices. I\nsoon observed, that without money there was no respect, honour, or\nconvenience to be acquired in life; that wealth amply supplied the want\nof wit, merit, and pedigree, having influence and pleasure ever at\ncommand; and that the world never failed to worship the flood of\naffluence, without examining the dirty channels through which it\ncommonly flowed.\n\n“At the end of the war, finding my appointments reduced to two\nshillings and fourpence per day, and being addicted to pleasures which\nI could not possibly purchase from such a fund, I sold my half-pay for\ntwo hundred pounds, which I lent upon bond to a young officer of the\nsame regiment, on condition that he should insure his life, and restore\none-fourth part of the sum by way of premium. I happened to be lucky in\nthis first essay; for the borrower, having in six weeks expended the\nmoney, made an excursion on the highway, was apprehended, tried,\nconvicted of felony, and cut his own throat, to prevent the shame of a\npublic execution; so that his bond was discharged by the insurers.\n\n“In short, gentlemen, when I engaged in this business, I determined to\ncarry it on with such spirit, as would either make my fortune, or\nentirely ruin me in a little time; and hitherto my endeavours have been\ntolerably successful. Nor do I think my proceedings a whit more\ncriminal or unjust than those of other merchants, who strive to turn\ntheir money to the best account. The commodity I deal in is cash; and\nit is my business to sell it to the best advantage. A London factor\nsends a cargo of goods to market, and if he gets two hundred per cent\nupon the sale, he is commended for industry and address. If I sell\nmoney for one-fourth part of that profit, certain persons will be so\nunjust as to cry, Shame upon me, for taking such advantage of my\nneighbour’s distress; not considering, that the trader took four times\nthe same advantage of those people who bought his cargo, though his\nrisk was not half so great as mine, and although the money I sold\nperhaps retrieved the borrower from the very jaws of destruction. For\nexample, it was but yesterday I saved a worthy man from being arrested\nfor a sum of money, for which he had bailed a friend who treacherously\nleft him in the lurch. As he did not foresee what would happen, he had\nmade no provision for the demand, and his sphere of life secluding him\nfrom all sorts of monied intercourse, he could not raise the cash by\nhis credit in the usual way of borrowing; so that, without my\nassistance, he must have gone to jail; a disgrace which would have\nproved fatal to the peace of his family, and utterly ruined his\nreputation.—Nay, that very young gentleman, from whom I am just now\nparted, will, in all probability, be indebted to me for a very genteel\nlivelihood. He had obtained the absolute promise of being provided for\nby a great man, who sits at the helm of affairs in a neighbouring\nkingdom; but, being destitute of all other resources, he could not have\nequipped himself for the voyage, in order to profit by his lordship’s\nintention, unless I had enabled him to pursue his good fortune.”\n\nRenaldo was not a little pleased to hear this harangue, to which Fathom\nreplied with many florid encomiums upon the usurer’s good sense and\nhumane disposition; then he explained the errand of his friend, which\nwas to borrow three hundred pounds, in order to retrieve his\ninheritance, of which he had been defrauded in his absence.\n\n“Sir,” said the lender, addressing himself to Count Melvil, “I pretend\nto have acquired by experience some skill in physiognomy; and though\nthere are some faces so deeply disguised as to baffle all the\npenetration of our art, there are others, in which the heart appears\nwith such nakedness of integrity, as at once to recommend it to our\ngoodwill. I own your countenance prepossesses me in your favour; and\nyou shall be accommodated, upon those terms from which I never deviate,\nprovided you can find proper security, that you shall not quit the\nBritish dominions; for that, with me, is a condition sine qua non.”\n\nThis was a very disagreeable declaration to Renaldo, who candidly\nowned, that, as his concerns lay upon the Continent, his purpose was to\nleave England without delay. The usurer professed himself sorry that it\nwas not in his power to oblige him; and, in order to prevent any\nfurther importunity, assured them, he had laid it down as a maxim, from\nwhich he would never swerve, to avoid all dealings with people whom, if\nneed should be, he could not sue by the laws of this realm.\n\nThus the intervention of one unlucky and unforeseen circumstance\nblasted in an instant the budding hopes of Melvil, who, while his\nvisage exhibited the most sorrowful disappointment, begged to know, if\nthere was any person of his acquaintance who might be less scrupulous\nin that particular.\n\nThe young gentleman directed them to another member of his profession,\nand wishing them success, took his leave with great form and\ncomplaisance. This instance of politeness was, however, no more than a\nshift to disengage himself the more easily from their entreaties; for,\nwhen the case was opened to the second usurer, he blessed himself from\nsuch customers, and dismissed them with the most mortifying and boorish\nrefusal. Notwithstanding these repulses, Renaldo resolved to make one\ndesperate push; and, without allowing himself the least respite,\nsolicited, one by one, not fewer than fifteen persons who dealt in this\nkind of traffic, and his proposals were rejected by each. At last,\nfatigued by the toil, and exasperated at the ill success of his\nexpedition, and half mad with the recollection of his finances, which\nwere now drained to half-a-crown, “Since we have nothing to expect,”\ncried he, “from the favour of Christians, let us have recourse to the\ndescendants of Judah. Though they lie under the general reproach of\nnations, as a people dead to virtue and benevolence, and wholly devoted\nto avarice, fraud, and extortion, the most savage of their tribe cannot\ntreat me with more barbarity of indifference, than I have experienced\namong those who are the authors of their reproach.”\n\nAlthough Fathom looked upon this proposal as an extravagant symptom of\ndespair, he affected to approve of the scheme, and encouraged Renaldo\nwith the hope of succeeding in another quarter, even if this expedition\nshould fail; for, by this time, our adventurer was half resolved to\nexport him at his own charge, rather than he should be much longer\nrestricted in his designs upon Monimia.\n\nMeanwhile, being resolved to try the experiment upon the children of\nIsrael, they betook themselves to the house of a rich Jew, whose wealth\nthey considered as a proof of his rapaciousness; and, being admitted\ninto his counting-house, they found him in the midst of half a dozen\nclerks, when Renaldo, in his imagination, likened him unto a minister\nof darkness surrounded by his familiars, and planning schemes of misery\nto be executed upon the hapless sons of men. In spite of these\nsuggestions, which were not at all mitigated by the forbidding aspect\nof the Hebrew, he demanded a private audience; and, being ushered into\nanother apartment, he explained his business with manifest marks of\ndisorder and affliction. Indeed, his confusion was in some measure\nowing to the looks of the Jew, who, in the midst of this exordium,\npulled down his eyebrows, which were surprisingly black and bushy, so\nas, in appearance, totally to extinguish his visage, though he was all\nthe time observing our youth from behind those almost impenetrable\nthickets.\n\nMelvil, having signified his request, “Young gentleman,” said the\nIsraelite, with a most discordant voice, “what in the name of goodness\ncould induce you to come to me upon such an errand? Did you ever hear\nthat I lent money to strangers without security?” “No,” replied\nRenaldo, “nor did I believe I should profit by my application; but my\naffairs are desperate; and my proposals having been rejected by every\nChristian to whom they were offered, I was resolved to try my fate\namong the Jews, who are reckoned another species of men.”\n\nFathom, alarmed at this abrupt reply, which he supposed could not fail\nto disgust the merchant, interposed in the conversation, by making an\napology for the plain dealing of his friend, who, he said, was soured\nand ruffled by his misfortunes; then exerting that power of eloquence\nwhich he had at command, he expostulated upon Renaldo’s claim and\nexpectations, described the wrongs he had suffered, extolled his\nvirtue, and drew a most pathetic picture of his distress.\n\nThe Jew listened attentively for some time; then his eyebrows began to\nrise and fall alternately; he coughed, sneezed, and winking hard, “I’m\nplagued,” said he, “with a salt rheum that trickles from my eyes\nwithout intermission.” So saying, he wiped the moisture from his face,\nand proceeded in these words: “Sir, your story is plausible; and your\nfriend is a good advocate; but before I give an answer to your demand,\nI must beg leave to ask if you can produce undeniable evidence of your\nbeing the identical person you really assume? If you are really the\nCount de Melvil, you will excuse my caution. We cannot be too much on\nour guard against fraud; though I must own you have not the air of an\nimpostor.”\n\nRenaldo’s eyes began to sparkle at this preliminary question; to which\nhe replied, that he could procure the testimony of the Emperor’s\nminister, to whom he had occasionally paid his respects since his first\narrival in England.\n\n“If that be the case,” said the Jew, “take the trouble to call here\nto-morrow morning, at eight o’clock, and I will carry you in my own\ncoach to the house of his excellency, with whom I have the honour to be\nacquainted; and, if he has nothing to object against your character or\npretensions, I will contribute my assistance towards your obtaining\njustice at the Imperial court.”\n\nThe Hungarian was so much confounded at this unexpected reception, that\nhe had not power to thank the merchant for his promised favour, but\nstood motionless and silent, while the streams of emotion of the heart\nwas of more weight with the Jew, than the eloquent acknowledgment which\nFerdinand took the opportunity of making for his friend; and he was\nfain to dismiss them a little abruptly, in order to prevent a second\ndischarge of that same rheum of which he had already complained.\n\nMelvil recollected all that had happened as a dream, which had no\nfoundation in truth, and was all day long in a sort of delirium,\nproduced by the alternate gusts of hope and fear that still agitated\nhis bosom; for he was not yet without apprehension of being again\ndisappointed by some unlucky occurrence.\n\nHe did not, however, fail to be punctual to the hour of his\nappointment, when the Jew told him, there would be no occasion for\nvisiting the ambassador, because Renaldo had been, the preceding day,\nrecognised by one of the clerks who had been employed as a purveyor in\nthe Imperial army; and who, knowing his family, confirmed everything he\nhad alleged. “After breakfast,” continued this benevolent Israelite, “I\nwill give you an order upon my banker for five hundred pounds, that you\nmay be enabled to appear at Vienna as the son and representative of\nCount Melvil; and you shall also be furnished with a letter of\nrecommendation to a person of some influence at that court, whose\nfriendship and countenance may be of some service to your suit; for I\nam now heartily engaged in your interest, in consequence of the fair\nand unblemished character which I find you have hitherto maintained.”\n\nThe reader must appeal to his own heart, to acquire a just idea of\nRenaldo’s feelings, when every tittle of these promises was fulfilled,\nand the merchant refused to take one farthing by way of premium,\ncontenting himself with the slender security of a personal bond. He\nwas, in truth, overwhelmed with the obligation, and certainly disposed\nto believe that his benefactor was something more than human. As for\nFathom, his sentiments took a different turn; and he scrupled not to\nimpute all this kindness to some deep-laid interested scheme, the scope\nof which he could not at present comprehend.\n\nAfter the tumults of the young gentleman’s joy had subsided, and he\nfound himself eased of that burdensome poverty under which he had\ngroaned so long, his thoughts, which before were dissipated upon the\nvarious circumstances of distress, began to collect themselves in a\nbody, and to resume their deliberations upon a subject which they had\nbeen long accustomed to consider; this was no other than the forlorn\nMonimia, whose idea now emerged in his bosom, being disencumbered of\none part of the load by which it had been depressed. He mentioned her\nname to Fathom with marks of the most melting compassion, deplored her\napostasy, and, while he protested that he had divorced her for ever\nfrom his heart, expressed an inclination to see her once more before\nhis departure, that he might in person exhort her to penitence and\nreformation.\n\nOur adventurer, who dreaded such an interview as the infallible means\nof his own ruin, resisted the proposal with the whole power of his\nelocution. He affirmed, that Renaldo’s desire was a manifest proof that\nhe still retained part of the fatal poison which that enchantress had\nspread within his veins; and that the sight of her, softened by his\nreproaches into tears and affected contrition, would dispel his\nresentment, disable his manhood, and blow the embers of his former\npassion to such a rage, as would hurry him on to a reconciliation,\nwhich would debase his honour, and ruin his future peace. In a word,\nFerdinand described the danger that would attend the meeting in such\nemphatic terms, that the Hungarian started with horror at the picture\nwhich he drew, and in this particular conformed with the admonition of\nhis friend.\n\nOne hundred pounds of the Jew’s money was immediately appropriated for\nthe payment of his most urgent debts; the like sum he presented to his\nfriend Fathom, with a solemn promise of sharing with him whatever good\nfortune might await him in Germany. And though Monimia had forfeited\nall title to his regard, so ill could he bear the prospect of her\ndistress, that he entrusted his dear companion with the half of what\nremained, to be expended for her use, fully resolving to screen her\nfrom the shocks and temptations of want, as the circumstances of his\nfuture fate would allow.\n\nFathom, far from opposing, applauded his generosity with marks of\nextreme wonder and admiration, assuring him, that she should be put in\npossession of his bounty immediately after his departure, he being\nunwilling to make her acquainted with her good fortune before that\nperiod, lest, finding his affairs in a fair way of being retrieved, she\nshould be base enough to worship his returning prosperity, and, by\nfalse professions, and artful blandishments, seek to ensnare his heart\nanew.\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT\n\nCOUNT FATHOM UNMASKS HIS BATTERY; IS REPULSED; AND VARIES HIS\nOPERATIONS WITHOUT EFFECT.\n\nEvery necessary preparation being made, Renaldo, accompanied by our\nadventurer, took the road to Dover, where he embarked in a packet-boat\nfor Calais, after having settled a correspondence with his dear\nFerdinand, from whom he did not part without tears. He had before\nsolicited him to be his fellow-traveller, that he might personally\nenjoy the benefit of his conversation and superior sagacity; but these\nentreaties he strenuously opposed, on pretence of his being determined\nto push his fortune in England, which he considered as his native\ncountry, and as the land in which, of all others, a man of merit has\nthe best encouragement. Such were the reasons he alleged for refusing\nto attend his benefactor, who was himself eagerly desirous of attaining\na settlement in the island of Great Britain. But our hero’s real\nmotives for staying were of a very different complexion.—The reader is\nalready informed of his aim upon the fair orphan, which, at present,\nwas the chief spring of his conduct. He may also recollect such\npassages of his life, as were sufficient to deter him from reappearing\nat Presburg or Vienna. But, besides these reflections, he was detained\nby a full persuasion that Renaldo would sink under the power and\ninfluence of his antagonist, consequently be rendered incapable to\nprovide for his friends; and that he himself, fraught with wiles and\nexperience as he was, could not fail to make himself amends for what he\nhad suffered among a people equally rich and unthinking.\n\nMelvil, having embraced our adventurer, and with a deep sigh bid him\ntake care of the unfortunate Monimia, committed himself to the sea,\nand, by the assistance of a favourable gale, was in four hours safely\nlanded on the French shore; while Fathom took post-horses for London,\nwhere he arrived that same night, and next day, in the forenoon, went\nto visit the beauteous mourner, who had as yet received no intimation\nof Renaldo’s departure or design. He found her in the attitude of\nwriting a letter to her inconstant lover, the contents of which the\nreader will be acquainted with in due time. Her countenance,\nnotwithstanding the veil of melancholy by which it was overcast, seemed\naltogether serene and composed; she was the picture of pious\nresignation, and sat like PATIENCE on a monument, smiling at grief.\nAfter having paid the compliment of the morning, Fathom begged pardon\nfor having omitted to visit her during three days, in which, he said,\nhis time had been wholly engrossed in procuring a proper equipage for\nCount Melvil, who had at last bid an eternal adieu to the island of\nGreat Britain.\n\nAt this information the hapless Monimia fell back in her chair, and\ncontinued some minutes in a swoon; from which being recovered, “Excuse\nme, Mr. Fathom,” cried she with a deep sigh; “this, I hope, is the last\nagony I shall feel from my unhappy passion.”—Then wiping the tears from\nher lovely eyes, she retrieved her tranquillity, and desired to know by\nwhat means Renaldo had been enabled to undertake his journey into the\nempire. Our hero, upon this occasion, assumed the whole merit of having\npromoted the interest of his friend, by giving her to understand, that\nhe, in consequence of an unforeseen windfall, had defrayed the expense\nof the Count’s equipment; though he observed, that it was not without\nreluctance he saw Renaldo make a wrong use of his friendship.\n\n“Although I was happy,” proceeded this artful traitor, “in being able\nto discharge my obligations to the house of Melvil, I could not help\nfeeling the most sensible chagrin, when I saw my assistance rendered\nsubservient to the triumphs of the youth’s baseness and infidelity; for\nhe chose, as the companion of his travels, the abandoned woman for whom\nhe had forsaken the all-perfect Monimia, whose virtue and\naccomplishments did not preserve her sacred from his ungrateful\nsarcasms and unmannerly ridicule. Believe me, madam, I was so shocked\nat his conversation on that subject, and so much incensed at his want\nof delicacy, that my temper was scarce sufficient for the ceremony of\nparting. And, now that my debt to his family is over-paid, I have\nsolemnly renounced his correspondence.”\n\nWhen she heard that, instead of betraying the least symptom of regret\nor compassion for her unhappy fate, the perfidious youth had exulted\nover her fall, and even made her a subject for his mirth, the blood\nrevisited her faded cheeks, and resentment restored to her eyes that\npoignancy which sorrow had before overcome. Yet she scorned to give\nspeech to her indignation; but, forcing a smile, “Why should I repine,”\nsaid she, “at the mortifications of a life which I despise, and from\nwhich, I hope, Heaven speedily will set me free!”\n\nFathom, fired by her emotion, which had recalled all the graces of her\nbeauty, exclaimed in a rapture, “Talk not so contemptuously of this\nlife, which hath still a fund of happiness in store for the amiable,\nthe divine Monimia. Though one admirer hath proved an apostate to his\nvows, your candour will not suffer you to condemn the whole sex. Some\nthere are, whose bosoms glow with passion equally pure, unalterable,\nand intense. For my own part, I have sacrificed to a rigid punctilio of\nhonour the dearest ideas of my heart. I beheld your unrivalled charms,\nand deeply felt their power. Yet, while a possibility of Melvil’s\nreformation remained, and while I was restrained by my niggard fortune\nfrom making a tender worthy of your acceptance, I combated with my\ninclinations, and bore without repining the pangs of hopeless love.\nBut, now that my honour is disengaged, and my fortune rendered\nindependent, by the last will of a worthy nobleman, whose friendship I\nwas favoured with in France, I presume to lay myself at the feet of the\nadorable Monimia, as the most faithful of admirers, whose happiness or\nmisery wholly depends upon her nod. Believe me, madam, these are not\nthe professions of idle gallantry—I speak the genuine, though\nimperfect, language of my heart. Words, even the most pathetic, cannot\ndo justice to my love. I gaze upon your beauty with ravishment; but I\ncontemplate the graces of your soul with such awful veneration, that I\ntremble while I approach you, as if my vows were addressed to some\nsuperior being.”\n\nDuring this declaration, which was pronounced in the most emphatic\nmanner, Monimia was successively agitated with shame, anger, and grief;\nnevertheless, she summoned her whole philosophy to her aid, and, with a\ntranquil, though determined air, begged he would not diminish the\nobligations he had already conferred, by disturbing with such\nunseasonable addresses a poor unhappy maid, who had detached all her\nthoughts from earthly objects, and waited impatiently for that\ndissolution which alone could put a period to her misfortunes.\n\nFathom, imagining that these were no other than the suggestions of a\ntemporary disappointment and despondence, which it was his business to\noppose with all his eloquence and art, renewed his theme with redoubled\nardour, and, at last, became so importunate in his desires, that\nMonimia, provoked beyond the power of concealing her resentment, said,\nshe was heartily sorry to find herself under the necessity of telling\nhim, that, in the midst of her misfortunes, she could not help\nremembering what she had been. Then, rising from her seat, with all the\ndignity of displeasure, “Perhaps,” added she, “you have forgot who was\nthe father of the once happy Monimia.”\n\nWith these words she retired into another chamber, leaving our\nadventurer confounded by the repulse he had sustained. Not that he was\ndiscouraged from prosecuting his aim—on the contrary, this rebuff\nseemed to add fresh vigour to his operations. He now thought it high\ntime to bring over Madam la Mer to his interest; and, to facilitate her\nconversion, took an opportunity of bribing her with some inconsiderable\npresents, after having amused her with a plausible tale of his passion\nfor Monimia, with whom she undertook the office of his mediatrix, on\nthe supposition that his intentions were honourable, and highly\nadvantageous to her lodger.\n\nShe was, first of all, invested with the office of obtaining pardon for\nthe offence he had given; and, in this negotiation she succeeded so\nwell, as to become an advocate for his suit; accordingly, she took all\noccasions of magnifying his praise. His agreeable person was often the\nsubject of her discourse to the fair mourner. Her admiration dwelt upon\nhis politeness, good sense, and winning deportment; and she every day\nretailed little stories of his benevolence and greatness of soul. The\ndefect in his birth she represented as a circumstance altogether\nforeign from the consideration of his merit; especially in a nation\nwhere such distinctions are as little respected as they will be in a\nfuture state. She mentioned several persons of note, who basked in the\nsunshine of power and fortune, without having enjoyed the least\nhereditary assistance from their forefathers. One, she said, sprung\nfrom the loins of an obscure attorney; another was the grandson of a\nvalet-de-chambre; a third was the issue of an accountant; and a fourth\nthe offspring of a woollen draper. All these were the children of their\nown good works, and had raised themselves upon their personal virtues\nand address; a foundation certainly more solid and honourable than a\nvague inheritance derived from ancestors, in whose deserts they could\nnot be supposed to have borne the least share.\n\nMonimia listened to all these arguments with great patience and\naffability, though she at once dived into the source from which all\nsuch insinuations flowed. She joined in the commendations of Fathom,\nand owned herself a particular instance of that benevolence which the\nold lady had so justly extolled; but, once for all, to prevent the\nsupplication which Madam la Mer was about to make, she solemnly\nprotested that her heart was altogether shut against any other earthly\nengagement, and that her thoughts were altogether employed upon her\neternal salvation.\n\nThe assiduous landlady, perceiving the steadiness of her disposition,\nthought proper to alter her method of proceeding, and, for the present,\nsuspended that theme by which she found her fair lodger disobliged.\nResolved to reconcile Monimia to life, before she would again recommend\nFerdinand to her love, she endeavoured to amuse her imagination, by\nrecounting the occasional incidents of the day, hoping gradually to\ndecoy her attention to those sublunary objects from which it had been\nindustriously weaned. She seasoned her conversation with agreeable\nsallies; enlarged upon the different scenes of pleasure and diversion\nappertaining to this great metropolis; practised upon her palate with\nthe delicacies of eating; endeavoured to shake her temperance with\nrepeated proffers and recommendations of certain cordials and\nrestoratives, which she alleged were necessary for the recovery of her\nhealth; and pressed her to make little excursions into the fields that\nskirt the town, for the benefit of air and exercise.\n\nWhile this auxiliary plied the disconsolate Monimia on one hand, Fathom\nwas not remiss on the other. He now seemed to have sacrificed his\npassion to her quiet; his discourse turned upon more indifferent\nsubjects. He endeavoured to dispel her melancholy with arguments drawn\nfrom philosophy and religion. On some occasions, he displayed all his\nfund of good humour, with a view to beguile her sorrow; he importuned\nher to give him the pleasure of squiring her to some place of innocent\nentertainment; and, finally, insisted upon her accepting a pecuniary\nreinforcement to her finances, which he knew to be in a most\nconsumptive condition.\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-NINE\n\nMONIMIA’S HONOUR IS PROTECTED BY THE INTERPOSITION OF HEAVEN.\n\nWith that complacency and fortitude which were peculiar to herself,\nthis hapless stranger resisted all those artful temptations. Her\nsustenance was barely such as exempted her from the guilt of being\naccessory to her own death; her drink was the simple element. She\nencouraged no discourse but that which turned upon the concerns of her\nimmortal part. She never went abroad, except in visits to a French\nchapel in the neighbourhood; she refused the proffered assistance of\nour adventurer with equal obstinacy and politeness, and with pleasure\nsaw herself wasting towards that period of mortality which was the\nconsummation of her wish. Yet her charms, far from melting away with\nher constitution, seemed to triumph over the decays of nature. Her\nshape and features still retained that harmony for which they had\nalways been distinguished. A mixture of majesty and sweetness diffused\nitself in her looks, and her feebleness added to that soft and feminine\ngrace which attracts the sympathy, and engages the protection of every\nhumane beholder. The associates thus baffled in their attempts to\nexcite her ideas of pleasure, again shifted their plan, and resolved to\nattack this forlorn beauty on the side of fear and mortification.\n\nOur adventurer became less frequent in his visits, and more indifferent\nin his language and deportment; while Madam la Mer gradually relaxed in\nthat complacency and respect with which she had hitherto behaved\ntowards her fair lodger. She even began to drop hints of disapprobation\nand reproach against this pattern of innocence and beauty, and at\nlength grew bold enough to tell her, that her misfortunes could be\nattributed to nothing but her own obstinacy and pride; that she had\nbeen at great pains to disoblige the only person who was able and\nwilling to raise her above dependence; and that, if his protection\nshould be withdrawn, she must be exposed to the utmost extremity of\ndistress.\n\nThese insinuations, instead of producing the desired effect, inflamed\nthe indignation of Monimia, who, in a most dignified style of rebuke,\nchid her for her indelicacy and presumption, observing, that she could\nhave no title to take such freedoms with lodgers, whose punctuality and\nregular deportment left her no room to complain. Notwithstanding this\nanimated reply, she underwent the most deplorable anguish, when she\nreflected upon the insolence of this woman, from whose barbarity she\nhad no resource; and, seeing no other possibility of redress than that\nof appealing to the good offices of Fathom, she conquered her\nreluctance so far, as to complain to him of Madam la Mer’s incivility.\n\nPleased with this application, he gave her to understand, with very\nlittle ceremony or preamble, that it wholly depended upon herself\nwhether she should continue to be wretched, or be delivered at once\nfrom all her cares and perplexity; that, notwithstanding the disdain\nwith which she had treated his addresses, he was still ready to lay\nhimself and his fortune at her feet; and that, if she should again\nreject the disinterested proposal, the whole world and her own\nconscience would charge upon herself whatever calamities she might be\nsubjected to in the sequel. Interpreting into a favourable hesitation\nher silence, which was the result of wrath and amazement, he proceeded\nto throw himself at her feet, and utter a romantic rhapsody, in the\ncourse of which, laying aside all that restraint which he had hitherto\npreserved, he seized her delicate hand, and pressed it to his lips;\nnay, so far did he forget himself on this occasion, that he caught the\nfair creature in his arms, and rudely ravished a kiss from those lips\nwhich he had before contemplated with the most distant reverence of\ndesire.\n\nHaving thus broken down the fences of decorum, and being heated with\ntransport, he, in all probability, would have acted the part of young\nTarquin, and violated by force that sacred shrine of honour, beauty,\nand unblemished truth, had not the wrath kindled by such an unexpected\noutrage inspired her with strength and spirits sufficient to protect\nher virtue, and intimidate the ruffian who could offer violence to such\nperfection. She broke from his detested embrace with surprising\nagility, and called aloud to her landlady for assistance; but that\ndiscreet matron was resolved to hear nothing, and Fathom’s appetite\nbeing whetted to a most brutal degree of eagerness, “Madam,” said he,\n“all opposition is vain. What you have refused to my entreaties, you\nshall yield to my power; and I am determined to force you to your own\nadvantage.”\n\nSo saying, he sprung towards her, with the most savage and impious\nintent, when this amiable heroine snatching up his sword, which lay\nupon a by-table, and unsheathing it instantaneously, presented the\npoint to his breast, and, while her eyes glanced with intolerable\nkeenness, “Villain!” cried she, “the spirit of my father animates my\nbosom, and the vengeance of Heaven shall not be frustrated.” He was not\nso much affected by his bodily danger, as awestruck at the manner of\nher address, and the appearance of her aspect, which seemed to shine\nwith something supernatural, and actually disordered his whole\nfaculties, insomuch that he retreated without attempting to make the\nleast reply; and she, having secured the door after his departure, sat\ndown to ponder upon this shocking event.\n\nWords are wanting to describe the accumulated horrors that took\npossession of her mind, when she thus beheld all her presaging fears\nrealised, and found herself at the mercy of two wretches, who had now\npulled off the mask, after having lost all sentiments of humanity.\nCommon affliction was an agreeable reverie to what she suffered,\ndeprived of her parents, exiled from her friends and country, reduced\nto the brink of wanting the most indispensable necessaries of life, in\na foreign land, where she knew not one person to whose protection she\ncould have recourse, from the inexpressible woes that environed her.\nShe complained to Heaven that her life was protracted, for the\naugmentation of that misery which was already too severe to be endured;\nfor she shuddered at the prospect of being utterly abandoned in the\nlast stage of mortality, without one friend to close her eyes, or do\nthe last offices of humanity to her breathless corse. These were\ndreadful reflections to a young lady who had been born to affluence and\nsplendour, trained up in all the elegance of education, by nature\nfraught with that sensibility which refines the sentiment and taste,\nand so tenderly cherished by her indulgent parents, that they suffered\nnot the winds of Heaven to visit her face too roughly.\n\nHaving passed the night in such agony, she rose at daybreak, and,\nhearing the chapel bell toll for morning prayers, resolved to go to\nthis place of worship, in order to implore the assistance of Heaven.\nShe no sooner opened her chamber door, with this intent, than she was\nmet by Madam la Mer, who, after having professed her concern for what\nhad happened overnight, and imputed Mr. Fathom’s rudeness to the spirit\nof intoxication, by which she had never before seen him possessed, she\nendeavoured to dissuade Monimia from her purpose, by observing, that\nher health would be prejudiced by the cold morning air; but finding her\ndetermined, she insisted upon accompanying her to chapel, on pretence\nof respect, though, in reality, with a view to prevent the escape of\nher beauteous lodger. Thus attended, the hapless mourner entered the\nplace, and, according to the laudable hospitality of England, which is\nthe only country in Christendom where a stranger is not made welcome to\nthe house of God, this amiable creature, emaciated and enfeebled as she\nwas, must have stood in a common passage during the whole service, had\nnot she been perceived by a humane gentlewoman, who, struck with her\nbeauty and dignified air, and melted with sympathy at the ineffable\nsorrow which was visible in her countenance, opened the pew in which\nshe sat, and accommodated Monimia and her attendant. If she was\ncaptivated by her first appearance, she was not less affected by the\ndeportment of her fair guest, which was the pattern of genuine\ndevotion.\n\nIn a word, this good lady, who was a merchant’s widow in opulent\ncircumstances, was inflamed with a longing desire to know and befriend\nthe amiable stranger, who, after service, turning about to thank her\nfor her civility, Madam Clement, with that frankness which is the\nresult of true benevolence, told her, she was too much prepossessed in\nher favour to let slip this opportunity of craving her acquaintance,\nand of expressing her inclination to alleviate, if possible, that\naffliction which was manifest in her looks.\n\nMonimia, overwhelmed with gratitude and surprise at this unexpected\naddress, gazed upon the lady in silence, and when she repeated her\ntenders of service, could make no other reply to her goodness, than by\nbursting into a flood of tears. This was a species of eloquence which\ndid not pass unregarded by Madam Clement, who, while her own eyes were\nbedewed with the drops of sympathy and compassion, took the lovely\norphan by the hand, and led her, without further ceremony, to her own\ncoach, that stood waiting at the door, whither they were followed by\nMrs. la Mer, who was so much confounded at the adventure, that she made\nno objections to the proposal of the lady, who handed her lodger into\nthe carriage; but retired, with all possible despatch, to make Fathom\nacquainted with this unforeseen event.\n\nMeanwhile the agitation of Monimia, at this providential deliverance,\nwas such as had well-nigh destroyed her tender frame. The blood flushed\nand forsook her cheeks by turns; she trembled from head to foot,\nnotwithstanding the consolatory assurances of Madam Clement, and,\nwithout being able to utter one word, was conducted to the house of\nthat kind benefactress, where the violence of her transports\noverpowered her constitution, and she sunk down upon a couch in a\nswoon, from which she was not easily recovered. This affecting\ncircumstance augmented the pity, and interested the curiosity of Madam\nClement, who concluded there was something very extraordinary in the\ncase of the stranger, to produce these agonies; and grew impatient to\nhear the particulars of her story.\n\nMonimia no sooner retrieved the use of her faculties, than looking\naround, and observing with what humane concern her new hostess was\nemployed in effecting her recovery, “Is this,” said she, “a flattering\nillusion of the brain? or am I really under the protection of some\nbeneficent being, whom Heaven hath inspired with generosity to rescue\nan hapless stranger from the most forlorn state of misery and woe?” Her\nvoice was at all times ravishingly sweet; and this exclamation was\npronounced with such pathetic fervour, that Madam Clement clasped her\nin her arms, and kissing her with all the eagerness of maternal\naffection, “Yes,” cried she, “fair creature, Heaven hath bestowed upon\nme an heart to compassionate, and power, I hope, to lighten the burden\nof your sorrows.”\n\nShe then prevailed upon her to take some nourishment, and afterwards to\nrecount the particulars of her fate; a task she performed with such\naccuracy and candour, that Madam Clement, far from suspecting her\nsincerity, saw truth and conviction in every circumstance of her tale;\nand, having condoled her misfortunes, entreated her to forget them, or\nat least look upon herself as one sheltered under the care and tuition\nof a person whose study it would be to supply her want of natural\nparents. This would have been an happy vicissitude of fortune, had it\nnot arrived too late; but such a sudden and unlooked-for transition not\nonly disordered the faculties of poor Monimia’s mind, but also\noverpowered the organs of her body, already fatigued and enfeebled by\nthe distresses she had undergone; so that she was taken ill of a fever\nthat same night, and became delirious before morning, when a physician\nwas called to her assistance.\n\nWhile this gentleman was in the house, Madam Clement was visited by\nFathom, who, after having complained, in the most insinuating manner\nthat she had encouraged his wife to abandon her duty, told her a\nplausible story of his first acquaintance with Monimia, and his\nmarriage at the Fleet, which, he said, he was ready to prove by the\nevidence of the clergyman who joined them, and that of Mrs. la Mer, who\nwas present at the ceremony. The good lady, although a little staggered\nat the genteel appearance and engaging address of this stranger, could\nnot prevail upon herself to believe that she had been imposed upon by\nher fair lodger, who by this time had given too convincing a proof of\nher sincerity; nevertheless, in order to prevent any dispute that might\nbe prejudicial to the health or recovery of Monimia, she gave him to\nunderstand, that she would not at present enter upon the merits of the\ncause, but only assure him, that the young lady was actually bereft of\nher senses, and in imminent danger of her life; for the truth of which\nassertions she would appeal to his own observation, and the opinion of\nthe physician, who was then employed in writing a prescription for the\ncure of her disease.\n\nSo saying, she conducted him into the chamber, where he beheld the\nhapless virgin stretched upon a sick-bed, panting under the violence of\na distemper too mighty for her weakly frame, her hair dishevelled, and\ndiscomposure in her looks; all the roses of her youth were faded, yet\nall the graces of her beauty were not fled. She retained that sweetness\nand symmetry, which death itself could not destroy; and though her\ndiscourse was incoherent, her voice was still musical, resembling those\nfeathered songsters who warble their native wood-notes wild.\n\nFathom, as upon all other occasions, so on this, did behave like an\ninimitable actor; he ran to the bedside, with all the trepidation of a\ndistracted lover; he fell upon his knees, and, while the tears rolled\ndown his cheeks, imprinted a thousand kisses on the soft hand of\nMonimia, who regarding him with a lack-lustre and undistinguishing eye,\n“Alas! Renaldo,” said she, “we were born to be unhappy.” “Would to\nHeaven,” cried Ferdinand, in a transport of grief, “the wretch Renaldo\nhad never been born! that is the villain who seduced the affection of\nthis unfortunate woman. I admitted the traitor into my friendship and\nconfidence, relieved him in his necessities; and, like the ungrateful\nviper, he hath stung the very bosom that cherished him in his\ndistress.” Then he proceeded to inform Madam Clement how he had\ndelivered that same Renaldo from prison, maintained him afterwards at a\ngreat expense, and at length furnished him with a sum of money and\nproper credentials to support his interest at the Court of Vienna.\n\nHaving finished this detail, he asked the physician’s sentiments of his\nwife’s distemper, and being told that her life was in extreme jeopardy,\nbegged he would use his utmost endeavours in her behalf, and even made\nhim a tender of an extraordinary fee, which was refused. He also\nthanked Madam Clement for her charity and benevolence towards a\nstranger, and took his leave with many polite professions of gratitude\nand esteem. He had no sooner quitted the house, than the physician, who\nwas a humane man, and a foreigner, began to caution the lady against\nhis insinuations, observing, that some circumstances of the story\nconcerning Renaldo were, to his particular knowledge, contrary to\ntruth; for that he himself had been applied to for letters of\nrecommendation in behalf of Count Melvil, by a Jew merchant of his\nacquaintance, who had supplied the young gentleman with money\nsufficient for his occasions, in consequence of a minute inquiry he had\nmade into the character of Renaldo, who was, by all reports, a youth of\nstrict honour and untainted morals.\n\nMadam Clement, thus cautioned, entered into deliberation with her own\nthoughts, and, comparing the particulars of this account with those of\nMonimia’s own story, she concluded that Fathom was the very traitor he\nhimself had described; and that he had, by abusing the confidence of\nboth, effected a fatal breach between two innocent and deserving\nlovers. She accordingly looked upon him with horror and detestation;\nbut nevertheless resolved to treat him with civility in the meantime,\nthat the poor young lady might not be disturbed in her last moments;\nfor she had now lost all hopes of her recovery. Yet the fever abated,\nand in two days she retrieved the use of her reason; though the\ndistemper had affected her lungs, and she was in all appearance doomed\nto linger a few weeks longer in a consumption.\n\nFathom was punctual in his visitation, though never admitted into her\npresence after the delirium vanished; and he had the opportunity of\nseeing her conveyed in a chariot to Kensington Gravel Pits, a place\nwhich may be termed the last stage of many a mortal peregrination. He\nnow implicitly believed that death would in a few days baffle all his\ndesigns upon the unfortunate Monimia; and foreseeing that, as he had\nowned himself her husband, he might be obliged to defray the expenses\nincurred by her sickness and burial, he very prudently intermitted in\nhis visits, and had recourse to the intelligence of his auxiliary.\n\nAs for Monimia, she approached the goal of life, not simply with\nresignation, but with rapture. She enjoyed in tranquillity the\nconversation of her kind benefactress, who never stirred from her\napartment; she was blessed with the spiritual consolation of a worthy\nclergyman, who removed all her religious scruples; and she\ncongratulated herself on the near prospect of that land of peace where\nsorrow is not known.\n\nAt length Mrs. la Mer gave notice to our adventurer of this amiable\nyoung lady’s decease, and the time fixed for the interment. Upon which\nthese two virtuous associates took possession of a place from whence\nthey could, unperceived, behold the funeral. He must have a hard heart,\nwho, without an emotion of pity, can see the last offices performed to\na young creature cut off in the flower of youth and beauty, even though\nhe knows not her name, and is an utter stranger to her virtues. How\ncallous then must the soul of that wretch have been, who, without a\nsymptom of remorse or concern, saw the sable hearse adorned with white\nplumes, as emblems of Monimia’s purity, pass before him, while her\nincomparable merit stood full in his remembrance, and he knew himself\nthe wicked cause of her untimely fate!\n\nPerfidious wretch! thy crimes turn out so atrocious, that I half repent\nme of having undertaken to record thy memoirs; yet such monsters ought\nto be exhibited to public view, that mankind may be upon their guard\nagainst imposture; that the world may see how fraud is apt to overshoot\nitself; and that, as virtue, though it may suffer for a while, will\ntriumph in the end; so iniquity, though it may prosper for a season,\nwill at last be overtaken by that punishment and disgrace which are its\ndue.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTY\n\nFATHOM SHIFTS THE SCENE, AND APPEARS IN A NEW CHARACTER.\n\nFathom’s expectations with respect to the fair orphan having thus\nproved abortive, he lost no time in bewailing his miscarriage, but had\nimmediate recourse to other means of improving his small fortune,\nwhich, at this period, amounted to near two hundred pounds. Whatever\ninclination he had to resume the character he had formerly borne in the\npolite world, he durst not venture to launch out again into the expense\nnecessary to maintain that station, because his former resources were\nnow stopped, and all the people of fashion by this time convinced of\nhis being a needy adventurer. Nevertheless, he resolved to sound the\nsentiments of his old friends at a distance, and judge, from the\nreception he should meet with, how far he might presume upon their\ncountenance and favour. For he rightly supposed, that if he could in\nany shape contribute to their interest or amusement, they would easily\nforgive his former pretensions to quality, arrogant as they were, and\nstill entertain him on the footing of a necessary acquaintance.\n\nWith this view, he one day presented himself at court in a very gay\nsuit of clothes, and bowed, at a distance, to many of his old\nfashionable friends of both sexes, not one of whom favoured him with\nany other notice, than that of a quarter curtsey, or slight inclination\nof the head. For, by this time, the few that remembered him knew from\nwhat retirement he now emerged, and avoided him accordingly as the jail\ninfection. But the greater part of those who had cultivated him in the\nzenith of his fortune were now utter strangers to his person, which\nthey had actually forgot, amidst the succession of novelties that\nsurrounded them; or, if they did recollect his name, it was remembered\nas an old fashion which had been many months out of date.\n\nNotwithstanding these mortifying discouragements, our hero, that same\nevening, effected a lodgment in a certain gaming-house not far from St.\nJames’s; and, as he played pretty high, and made a parade of his ready\nmoney, he was soon recognised by divers persons of consequence, who\ncordially welcomed him to England, on pretence of believing he had been\nabroad, and with great complacency repeated their former professions of\nfriendship. Though this was a certain way of retaining the favour of\nthose worthies, while his finances continued to flourish, and his\npayments were prompt, he knew the weakness of his funds too well, to\nthink they could bear the vicissitudes of play; and the remembrance of\nthe two British knights who had spoiled him at Paris, hung over his\nimagination with the most frightful presages. Besides, he perceived\nthat gaming was now managed in such a manner, as rendered skill and\ndexterity of no advantage. For the spirit of play having overspread the\nland, like a pestilence, raged to such a degree of madness and\ndesperation, that the unhappy people who were infected, laid aside all\nthoughts of amusement, economy, or caution, and risked their fortunes\nupon issues equally extravagant, childish, and absurd.\n\nThe whole mystery of the art was reduced to the simple exercise of\ntossing up a guinea, and the lust of laying wagers, which they indulged\nto a surprising pitch of ridiculous intemperance. In one corner of the\nroom might be heard a pair of lordlings running their grandmothers\nagainst each other, that is, betting sums on the longest liver; in\nanother the success of the wager depended upon the sex of the\nlandlady’s next child; and one of the waiters happening to drop down in\nan apoplectic fit, a certain noble peer exclaimed, “Dead for a thousand\npounds.” The challenge was immediately accepted; and when the master of\nthe house sent for a surgeon to attempt the cure, the nobleman, who set\nthe price upon the patient’s head, insisted upon his being left to the\nefforts of nature alone, otherwise the wager should be void. Nay, when\nthe landlord harped upon the loss he should sustain by the death of a\ntrusty servant, his lordship obviated the objection, by desiring that\nthe fellow might be charged in the bill.\n\nIn short, the rage of gaming seemed to have devoured all their other\nfaculties, and to have equalled the rash enthusiasm of the inhabitants\nof Malacca in the East Indies, who are so possessed with that\npernicious spirit, that they sacrifice to it not only their fortunes,\nbut also their wives and children; and then letting their hair down\nupon their shoulders, in imitation of the ancient Lacedaemonians when\nthey devoted themselves to death, those wretches unsheathe their\ndaggers, and murder every living creature in their way. In this,\nhowever, they differ from the gamesters of our country, who never find\ntheir senses, until they have lost their fortunes, and beggared their\nfamilies; whereas the Malays never run amuck, but in consequence of\nmisery and despair.\n\nSuch are the amusements, or rather such is the continual employment of\nthose hopeful youths who are destined by birth to be the judges of our\nproperty, and pillars of our constitution. Such are the heirs and\nrepresentatives of those patriots who planned, and those heroes who\nmaintained, the laws and freedom of their country; who were the patrons\nof merit, the fathers of the poor, the terror of vice and immorality,\nand at once the ornaments and support of a happy nation.\n\nOur adventurer considered all these circumstances with his wonted\nsagacity, and, seeing upon what precarious footing he must stand,\nshould he rank himself with such society, he wisely came to the\nresolution of descending one step in the degrees of life, and of taking\nupon him the title of physician, under which he did not despair of\ninsinuating himself into the pockets of his patients, and into the\nsecrets of private families, so as to acquire a comfortable share of\npractice, or captivate the heart of some heiress or rich widow, whose\nfortune would at once render him independent and happy.\n\nAfter this determination, his next care was to concert measures for his\nfirst appearance in this new character; well knowing, that the success\nof a physician, in a great measure, depends upon the external equipage\nin which he first declares himself an adept in the healing art. He\nfirst of all procured a few books on the subject of medicine, which he\nstudied with great attention during the remaining part of the winter\nand spring, and repaired to Tunbridge with the first of the season,\nwhere he appeared in the uniform of Aesculapius, namely, a plain suit,\nfull trimmed, with a voluminous tie-periwig; believing that in this\nplace he might glide, as it were, imperceptibly into the functions of\nhis new employment, and gradually accustom himself to the method and\nform of prescription.\n\nA man so well known in the gay world could not be supposed to effect\nsuch a transformation without being observed; and therefore, in order\nto anticipate the censure and ridicule of those who might be tempted to\nmake themselves merry at his expense, he, on his arrival at the wells,\nrepaired to the shop of an apothecary, and calling for pen, ink, and\npaper, wrote a prescription, which he desired might be immediately made\nup. While this was doing by the servant, he was invited into a parlour\nby the master, with whom he entered into conversation touching the\nproperties of the Tunbridge water, which seemed to have been his\nparticular study; and indeed he had perused Rouzee’s treatise on that\nsubject with indefatigable assiduity. From this theme, he made\ndigressions into other parts of medicine, upon which he spoke with such\nplausible elocution, that the apothecary, whose knowledge in that art\nwas not very profound, looked upon him as a physician of great learning\nand experience, and hinted a desire of knowing his name and situation.\n\nFathom accordingly gave him to understand, that he had studied physic,\nand taken his degrees at Padua, rather for his amusement, than with any\nview of exercising medicine, as he then could not possibly foresee the\nmisfortunes which had since happened to his family, and by which he was\nnow compelled to have recourse to a profession that was very much\nbeneath the expectations of his birth. Yet he bore his disappointments\nwith resignation, and even good-humour, and blessed his stars for\nhaving inclined him to the study of any branch of knowledge by which he\nmight be enabled to laugh at the vicissitudes of fortune. He then\nobserved, that he had practised with some applause at the hot well near\nBristol, before he thought he should be ever reduced to the necessity\nof taking a fee, and that, in all probability, his metamorphosis, when\nknown, would furnish matter of surprise and merriment to some of his\nold acquaintance.\n\nThe apothecary was equally struck with his polite address, and pleased\nwith his agreeable discourse. He consoled him for the misfortunes of\nhis family, by assuring him, that in England nothing could be more\nhonourable, or indeed profitable, than the character of a physician,\nprovided he could once wriggle himself into practice; and insinuated,\nthat, although he was restricted by certain engagements with other\npersons of the faculty, he should be glad of an opportunity to show his\nregard for Doctor Fathom. This was a very effectual method which our\nhero took to intimate his new character to the public. By the industry\nand communicative disposition of the apothecary, it was circulated in\nhalf a day through every family in the place; and, next morning, when\nFerdinand appeared, the company forthwith assembled in separate groups,\nand from each knot he heard his name reverberated in a whisper.\n\nHaving thus announced himself to all whom it might concern, and allowed\nthe ladies two days to discuss the merit of his transfiguration,\ntogether with the novelty of the case, he ventured to salute, at a\ndistance, a lady and her daughter, who had been his patients at the hot\nwell; and, although they honoured his bow with the return of a slight\ncurtsey, they gave him not the least encouragement to make a nearer\napproach. Notwithstanding this rebuff, he concluded, that, should the\nhealth of either come in question, they would renew their application\nto his skill, and what was refused by their pride would be granted by\ntheir apprehension. Here, however, he happened to be mistaken in his\nconjecture.\n\nThe young lady being seized with a violent headache and palpitation,\nher mother desired the apothecary to recommend a physician; and the\nperson with whom he was contracted being at that time absent, he\nproposed Doctor Fathom as a man of great ability and discretion. But\nthe good lady rejected the proposal with disdain, because she had\nformerly known him in the character of a Count—though that very\ncharacter was the chief reason that had then induced her to crave his\nadvice.\n\nSuch is the caprice of the world in general, that whatever bears the\nface of novelty captivates, or rather bewitches, the imagination, and\nconfounds the ideas of reason and common sense. If, for example, a\nscullion, from the clinking of pewter, shall conceive a taste for the\nclinking of rhyme, and make shift to bring together twenty syllables,\nso as that the tenth and last shall have the like ending, the\ncomposition is immediately extolled as a miracle; and what appeals to\nthe admiration is not the wit, the elegance, or poetry of the work, but\nthe uncultivated talent and humble station of the author. A reader does\nnot exclaim, “What a delicate sentiment! what a beautiful simile! what\neasy and musical versification!”—but cries in rapture, “Heavens! what a\nprodigy a poet from the scullery! a muse in livery! or, Apollo with a\ntrowel!”—The public is astonished into liberality—the scullion eats\nfrom those trenchers he scoured before—the footman is admitted into the\ncoach behind which he was wont to stand—and the bricklayer, instead of\nplastering walls, bedaubs his illustrious partner with the mortar of\nhis praise. Thus, lifted into a higher sphere, their talents receive\ncultivation; they become professed bards, and though their subsequent\nworks bear evident marks of improvement, they are neglected among the\nrest of their brethren, because that novelty, which recommended them in\nthe beginning, no longer remains.\n\nSo it fared with our adventurer in his new occupation. There was\nsomething so extraordinary in a nobleman’s understanding medicine, and\nso uncommon in a physician’s prescribing gratis, that the curiosity and\nadmiration of the company at Bristol were engaged, and they followed\nhis advice, as the direction of some supernatural intelligence. But,\nnow that he professed himself one of the faculty, and might be supposed\nto have refreshed his memory, and reinforced his knowledge for the\noccasion, he was as much overlooked as any other physician unsupported\nby interest or cabal; or, at least, the notice he attracted was not at\nall to the advantage of his character, because it wholly regarded the\ndecline of his fortune, which is a never-failing fund of disgrace.\n\nThese mortifications did not overcome the patience and perseverance of\nFathom, who foresaw, that the soothing hand of time would cast a veil\nof oblivion over those scenes which were remembered to his prejudice;\nand that, in the meantime, though he was excluded from the private\nparties of the fair sex, in which his main hope of success was placed,\nhe should be able to insinuate himself into some degree of favour and\npractice among the male patients; and some lucky cure, properly\ndisplayed, might be the means of propagating his fame, and banishing\nthat reserve which at present interfered with his purpose. Accordingly,\nit was not long before he found means to break that spell of universal\nprejudice that hedged him in. At the ordinary which he frequented, his\npolite carriage, facetious remarks, and agreeable stories soon\nconciliated the regard of his fellow-guests, among whom he sometimes\nrallied his own transformation with singular good-humour and success.\nHe was even witty upon his want of employment, and used to observe,\nthat a physician without practice had one comfort to which his brethren\nwere strangers, namely, that the seldomer he had occasion to prescribe,\nthe less he had upon his conscience on account of being accessory to\nthe death of his fellow-creatures.\n\nNothing so effectually blunts the shafts of ridicule, and defeats the\naims of slander, as this method of anticipation. In spite of the arrows\nthat were levelled against his reputation from every tea-table at\nTunbridge, he made his party good among almost all the gay young\ngentlemen that frequented the place. Far from avoiding his company,\nthey began to court his conversation, and he was commonly seen in the\nwalks surrounded with a group of admirers.\n\nHaving thus paved the way for a total removal of the invidious\nprepossession that obstructed his views, he, one night, while every\nperson was lulled in the arms of repose, and universal silence\nprevailed, tuned his violin, and began to play some masterly airs, in a\ntone so uncommonly expressive, and with such ravishing dexterity of\nexecution, that a certain lady, who lodged in the same house, being\nwaked by the music, and ignorant of the source from which it flowed,\nlistened with rapture, as to the harp of an angel, and, wrapping\nherself in a loose gown, rose and opened her chamber door, in order to\ndiscover in what apartment the musician resided. She no sooner entered\nthe passage, than she found her fellow-lodgers already assembled on the\nsame occasion; and there they remained during the best part of the\nnight, transported by the harmony which our hero produced.\n\nDoctor Fathom was immediately known to be the author of this\nentertainment; and thus retrieved the benefit of that admiration which\nhe had forfeited by appearing in the shape of a physician. For, as\npeople had formerly wondered to see a count skilled in medicine, they\nwere now amazed to find a physician such a master in music.\n\nThe good effects of this stratagem were almost instantaneous. His\nperformance became the topic of discourse among all the fashionable\ncompany. His male friends complimented him from the information of the\nother sex; and that lady whom he had regaled, instead of that shyness\nand disdain with which she used to receive his salutation, at their\nvery next meeting in the thoroughfare, returned his bow with marks of\nprofound respect. Nay, at midnight, she, with the rest, took post in\nthe same place where they had been stationed before; and, by frequent\ntittering, and repeated whispers, gave intimation to Fathom, that they\nwould be glad of a second serenade. But he was too well acquainted with\nthe human passions to indulge this their desire. It was his interest to\ninflame their impatience, rather than to gratify their expectation; and\ntherefore he tantalised them for some hours, by tuning his violin, and\nplaying some flourishes, which, however, produced nothing to fulfil\ntheir wishes.\n\nAt the ordinary, he was accosted by a gentleman, a lodger in the same\nhouse, who assured him, that the ladies would take it as a great favour\nif he would let them know when he intended to amuse himself again with\nhis instrument, that they might not, by falling asleep beforehand,\ndeprive themselves of the pleasure of hearing his music. To this\nmessage he replied, with an air of consequence and reserve, that,\nthough music was not the art he professed, he should be always\ncomplaisant enough to entertain the ladies to the utmost of his power,\nwhen their commands were signified to him in a manner suited to his\ncharacter; but that he would never put himself on the footing of an\nitinerate harper, whose music is tolerated through the medium of a\nboard partition. The gentleman having reported this answer to his\nconstituents, they empowered him to invite Doctor Fathom to breakfast,\nand he was next morning introduced with the usual ceremony, and treated\nwith uncommon regard by all the females of the house, assembled for his\nreception.\n\nHaving thus broken the ice of their aversion in one part, so as that\nthe beams of his personal accomplishments had room to operate, he soon\neffected a general thaw in his favour, and found himself growing once\nmore into request amongst the most amiable part of the creation. His\ncompany was coveted, and his taste consulted in their balls, concerts,\nand private assemblies; and he recompensed the regard they paid to him\nwith an incessant exertion of his agreeable talents, politeness, and\ngood-humour.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTY-ONE\n\nTRIUMPHS OVER A MEDICAL RIVAL.\n\nYet, in the midst of all this attention, his medical capacity seemed to\nbe quite forgot. They respected his good breeding, were charmed with\nhis voice, and admired the fine touches of his hand upon the violin;\nbut in cultivating the fiddler, they utterly neglected the physician;\nand in vain did he attempt to divide their regard, by taking all\nopportunities to turn the conversation into a more interesting channel.\nIt was to little purpose he endeavoured to arouse the wonder of his\naudience with frequent descriptions of portentous maladies and amazing\ncures he had seen and performed in the course of his study and practice\nabroad; and to no effect did he publicly busy himself in making\nexperiments on the mineral water, in which he pretended to have made\nseveral new and important discoveries. These efforts did not make a\nlasting impression upon the minds of the company; because they saw\nnothing surprising in a physician’s being acquainted with all the\nmysteries of his art; and, as their custom was already bespoke for\nothers of the profession, whom it was their interest to employ, our\nadventurer might have starved amidst the caresses of his acquaintance,\nhad not he derived considerable advantage from a lucky accident in the\ncourse of his expectancy.\n\nA gentlewoman’s daughter, of a weakly constitution, by drinking the\nwaters, had so far recovered her health and complexion, as to allure\nthe affection of a young squire in the neighbourhood, who amused her\nfor some time with his addresses, until his heart was seduced by the\ncharms of another young lady lately arrived at the wells. The forsaken\nnymph, shocked at this disgrace and mortification, relapsed into her\nformer languishing disorder; and was by her mother put under the\nmanagement and prescription of a physician, who had been an industrious\nenemy of Fathom from his first appearance at Tunbridge. The patient,\nthough violently chagrined at the levity of her quondam admirer, was\nnot altogether without hope, that the very same inconstancy which had\nprompted him to leave her, might in time induce him to return, after\nthe novelty of his new passion should be wore off; and this hope served\nto support her under the sorrow and disgrace of her disappointment. At\nlength, however, the squire and his new mistress disappeared; and some\nbusybody was officious enough to communicate this piece of news to the\nforlorn shepherdess, with this additional circumstance, that they were\ngone to a neighbouring parish to be joined in the bands of wedlock.\n\nThese fatal tidings were no sooner imparted to the abandoned Phillis,\nthan she was seized with an hysteric fit; and, what rendered the\naccident more unfortunate, her physician had been called to the\ncountry, and was not expected at Tunbridge till next day. The\napothecary was immediately summoned; and, being either puzzled by the\nsymptoms, or afraid of encroaching upon the province of his superiors,\nadvised the old lady to send for Doctor Fathom without delay. She had\nno other objection to this expedient, but the enmity which she knew\nsubsisted between the two leeches; yet, hearing that her own doctor\nwould not consult with Fathom upon his return but, perhaps renounce the\npatient, by which means her daughter’s health might be endangered, she\nwould not solicit our hero’s assistance, until the young lady had\nremained seven hours speechless and insensible; when, her fear\nprevailing over every other consideration, she implored the advice of\nour adventurer, who, having made the necessary interrogations, and felt\nthe patient’s pulse, which was regular and distinct, found reason to\nconclude that the fit would not last much longer, and, after having\nobserved that she was in a very dangerous way, prescribed some\nmedicines for external application; and, to enhance their opinion of\nhis diligence and humanity, resolved to stay in the room and observe\ntheir effect.\n\nHis judgment did not fail him on this occasion. In less than half an\nhour after his embrocations had been applied, she recovered the use of\nher tongue, opened her eyes, and having, in delirious exclamations,\nupbraided her perfidious lover, became quite sensible and composed,\nthough she continued extremely low and dejected. To remedy these\nsinkings, certain cordials were immediately administered, according to\nthe prescription of Doctor Fathom, upon whom extraordinary encomiums\nwere bestowed by all present, who believed he had actually rescued her\nfrom the jaws of death; and as he was by this time let into the secrets\nof the family, he found himself in a fair way of being an egregious\nfavourite of the old gentlewoman; when, unluckily, his brother, having\ndismissed his country patient with uncommon despatch, entered the\napartment, and eyed his rival with looks of inexpressible rage; then,\nsurveying the patient, and the phials that stood upon the table, by\nturns, “What, in the name of God!” cried he, “is the meaning of all\nthis trash!”\n\n“Really, doctor,” replied the mother, a little confounded at being thus\ntaken by surprise, “Biddy has been taken dangerously ill, and lain\nseven or eight hours in a severe fit, from which I am confident she\nwould never have recovered without the help of a physician; and as you\nwere absent, we had recourse to this gentleman, whose prescription hath\nhad a happy and surprising effect.” “Effect!” cried this offended\nmember of the faculty, “pshaw!—stuff!—who made you judge of effects or\ncauses?” Then advancing to the patient, “What has been the matter, Miss\nBiddy, that you could not wait till my return?”\n\nHere Fathom interposing, “Sir,” said he, “if you will step into the\nnext room, I will communicate my sentiments of the case, together with\nthe method upon which I have proceeded, that we may deliberate upon the\nnext step that is to be taken.” Instead of complying with this\nproposal, he seated himself in a chair, with his back to our\nadventurer, and, while he examined Miss Biddy’s pulse, gave him to\nunderstand, that he should not consult with him about the matter.\n\nFathom, not in the least disconcerted at this uncivil answer, walked\nround his antagonist, and, placing himself in his front, desired to\nknow his reason for treating him with such supercilious contempt. “I am\nresolved,” said the other, “never to consult with any physician who has\nnot taken his degrees at either of the English universities.” “Upon the\nsupposition,” replied our adventurer, “that no person can be properly\neducated for the profession at any other school.” “You are in the\nright,” answered Doctor Looby; “that is one of many reasons I have to\ndecline the consultation.”\n\n“How far you are in the right,” retorted Fathom, “I leave the world to\njudge, after I have observed, that, in your English universities, there\nis no opportunity of studying the art; no, not so much as a lecture\ngiven on the subject. Nor is there one physician of note in this\nkingdom who has not derived the greatest part of his medical knowledge\nfrom the instructions of foreigners.”\n\nLooby, incensed at this asseveration, which he was not prepared to\nrefute, exclaimed, in a most infuriate accent, “Who are you?—whence\ncame you?—where was you bred? You are one of those, I believe, who\ngraduate themselves, and commence doctors, the Lord knows how; an\ninterloper, who, without licence or authority, comes hither to take the\nbread out of the mouths of gentlemen who have been trained to the\nbusiness in a regular manner, and bestowed great pains and expense to\nqualify themselves for the profession. For my own part, my education\ncost me fifteen hundred pounds.”\n\n“Never was money laid out to less purpose,” said Ferdinand; “for it\ndoes not appear that you have learned so much as the basis of medical\nrequirements, namely, that decorum and urbanity which ought to\ndistinguish the deportment of every physician. You have even debased\nthe noblest and most beneficial art that ever engaged the study of\nmankind, which cannot be too much cultivated, and too little\nrestrained, in seeking to limit the practice of it to a set of\nnarrow-minded, illiberal wretches, who, like the lowest handicraftsmen,\nclaim the exclusive privileges of a corporation. Had you doubted my\nability, you ought to have satisfied yourself in a manner consistent\nwith decency and candour; but your behaviour on this occasion is such a\nmalicious outrage upon good manners and humanity, that, were it not for\nmy regard to these ladies, I would chastise you for your insolence on\nthe spot. Meanwhile, madam,” addressing himself to the mother, “you\nmust give me leave to insist upon your dismissing either that\ngentleman, or me, without hesitation.”\n\nThis peremptory language had an instantaneous effect upon the hearers.\nLooby’s face grew pale, and his nether lip began to tremble. The\npatient was dismayed, and the old gentlewoman concerned and perplexed.\nShe earnestly besought the gentlemen to be reconciled to each other,\nand enter into a friendly consultation upon her daughter’s distemper;\nbut, finding both equally averse to accommodation, and Fathom becoming\nmore and more importunate in his demand, she presented him with a\ndouble fee; and giving him to understand that Doctor Looby had long\nattended the family, and was intimately acquainted with her own and\nBiddy’s constitution, said, she hoped he would not take it amiss if she\nretained her old physician.\n\nThough our hero was much mortified at this triumph of his rival, he\nmade a virtue of necessity, and retired with great complaisance,\nwishing that Miss Biddy might never again be the subject of such a\ndisagreeable dispute. Whether the patient was frighted at this\naltercation, or displeased with her mother’s decision against an\nagreeable young fellow, who had, as it were, recalled her from the\ngrave, and made himself master of the secret that rankled at her heart,\nor the disease had wound up her nerves for another paroxysm, certain it\nis, she all of a sudden broke forth into a violent peal of laughter,\nwhich was succeeded by the most doleful cries, and other expressions of\ngrief; then she relapsed into a fit, attended with strong convulsions,\nto the unspeakable terror of the old gentlewoman, who entreated Doctor\nLooby to be expeditious in his prescription. Accordingly he seized the\npen with great confidence, and a whole magazine of antihysteric\nmedicines were, in different forms, externally and internally applied.\n\nNevertheless, either nature was disturbed in her own efforts by these\napplications, or the patient was resolved to disgrace the doctor. For\nthe more remedies that were administered, her convulsions became the\nmore violent; and in spite of all his endeavours, he could not overcome\nthe obstinacy of the distemper. Such a miscarriage, upon the back of\nhis rival’s success, could not fail to overwhelm him with confusion;\nespecially as the mother baited him with repeated entreaties to do\nsomething for the recovery of her daughter. At length, after having\nexercised her patience in vain for several hours, this affectionate\nparent could no longer suppress the suggestions of her concern, but, in\nan incoherent strain, told him that her duty would not suffer her to be\nlonger silent in an affair on which depended the life of her dear\nchild. That she had seen enough to believe he had mistaken the case of\npoor Biddy, and he could not justly blame her for recalling Doctor\nFathom, whose prescription had operated in a miraculous manner.\n\nLooby, shocked at this proposal, protested against it with great\nvehemence, as an expedient highly injurious to himself. “My remedies,”\nsaid he, “are just beginning to take effect, and, in all probability,\nthe fit will not last much longer; so that, by calling in another\nperson at this juncture, you will defraud me of that credit which is my\ndue, and deck my adversary with trophies to which he has no\npretension.” She was prevailed upon, by this remonstrance, to wait\nanother half hour, when perceiving, as yet, no alteration for the\nbetter, and being distracted with her fears, which reproached her with\nwant of natural affection, she sent a message to Doctor Fathom,\ndesiring to see him with all possible despatch.\n\nHe was not slow in obeying the call, but hastening to the scene of\naction, was not a little surprised to find Looby still in the\napartment. This gentleman, since better might not be, resolved to\nsacrifice his pride to his interest, and, rather than lose his patient\naltogether, and run the risk of forfeiting his reputation at the same\ntime, stayed with intention to compromise his difference with Fathom,\nthat he might not be wholly excluded from the honour of the cure, in\ncase it could be effected. But he had reckoned without his host in his\ncalculation of the Count’s placability; for, when he put on his\ncapitulating face, and, after a slight apology for his late behaviour,\nproposed that all animosity should subside in favour of the young lady,\nwhose life was at stake, our hero rejected his advances with infinite\ndisdain, and assured the mother, in a very solemn tone, that, far from\nconsulting with a man who had treated him so unworthily, he would not\nstay another minute in the house, unless he should see him discarded; a\nsatisfaction barely sufficient to atone for the affront he himself had\nsuffered by the unjust preference she had before given to his rival.\n\nThere was no remedy. Looby was obliged to retreat in his turn; then our\nadventurer, approaching the bedside, reconnoitred the patient, examined\nthe medicines which had been administered, and lifting up his eyes in\nexpressive silence, detached the footman with a new order to the\napothecary. It was well the messenger used expedition, otherwise Doctor\nFathom would have been anticipated by the operation of nature; for, the\nfit having almost run its career, Miss Biddy was on the point of\nretrieving her senses, when the frontal prescribed by Fathom was\napplied; to the efficacy of this, therefore, was ascribed her recovery,\nwhen she opened her eyes, and began to pour forth unconnected\nejaculations; and in a few moments after, she was persuaded to swallow\na draught prepared for the purpose, her perception returned, and\nFerdinand gained the reputation of having performed a second miracle.\n\nBut he was furnished with a piece of intelligence, of much more energy\nthan all she had taken, and so soon as he concluded she was capable to\nbear the news without any dangerous emotion, he, among other articles\nof chit-chat culled for her amusement, took the opportunity of telling\nthe company, that Squire Stub (the cause of Miss Biddy’s disorder) had,\nin his way to matrimony, been robbed of his bride, by a gentleman to\nwhom she had been formerly engaged. He had waited for her on purpose at\nan inn on the road, where he found means to appease her displeasure,\nwhich he had, it seems, incurred, and to supersede her new lover, whom\nshe quitted without ceremony; upon which the squire had returned to\nTunbridge, cursing her levity, yet blessing his good stars for having\nso seasonably prevented his ruin, which would have infallibly been the\nconsequence of his marrying such an adventurer.\n\nIt would be superfluous to observe, that these tidings operated like an\nadmirable specific on the spirits of the young lady, who, while she\naffected to pity the squire, was so much overjoyed at his\ndisappointment, that her eyes began to sparkle with uncommon vivacity,\nand in less than two hours after the last of those terrible attacks,\nshe was restored to a better state of health than she had enjoyed for\nmany weeks. Fathom was not forgot amidst the rejoicings of the family.\nBesides an handsome gratuity for the effects of his extraordinary\nskill, the old lady favoured him with a general invitation to her\nhouse, and the daughter not only considered him as the restorer of her\nhealth, and angel of her good fortune, but also began to discover an\nuncommon relish for his conversation; so that he was struck with the\nprospect of succeeding Squire Stub in her affection. A conquest which,\nif sanctioned by the approbation of the mother, would console him for\nall the disappointments he had sustained; for Miss Biddy was entitled\nto a fortune of ten thousand pounds, provided she should marry with the\nconsent of her parent, who was the sole executrix of the father’s will.\n\nAnimated with the hope of such an advantageous match, our adventurer\nmissed no opportunity of improving the lodgment he had made, while the\ntwo ladies failed not to extol his medical capacity among all their\nfemale acquaintances. By means of this circulation, his advice was\ndemanded in several other cases, which he managed with such an imposing\nair of sagacity and importance, that his fame began to spread, and\nbefore the end of the season, he had ravished more than one half of the\nbusiness from his competitor. Notwithstanding these fortunate events,\nhe foresaw, that he should find great difficulty in transplanting his\nreputation, so as to take root in London, which was the only soil in\nwhich he could propose to rise to any degree of prosperity and\nindependence; and this reflection was grounded upon a maxim which\nuniversally prevails among the English people, namely, to overlook and\nwholly neglect, on their return to the metropolis, all the connexions\nthey may have chanced to acquire during their residence at any of the\nmedical wells. And this social disposition is so scrupulously\nmaintained, that two persons who lived in the most intimate\ncorrespondence at Bath or Tunbridge, shall in four-and-twenty hours so\ntotally forget their friendship, as to meet in St. James’s Park,\nwithout betraying the least token of recognition; so that one would\nimagine these mineral waters were so many streams issuing from the\nriver Lethe, so famed of old for washing away all traces of memory and\nrecollection.\n\nAware of this oblivious principle, Doctor Fathom collected all his\nqualifications, in order to make such an impression upon the heart of\nMiss Biddy, as would resist all her endeavours to shake him from her\nremembrance; and his efforts succeeded so well, that Squire Stub’s\nadvances to a reconciliation were treated with manifest indifference.\nIn all probability our hero would have made a very advantageous\ncampaign, had not his good fortune been retarded by an obstruction,\nwhich, as he did not perceive it, he could not possibly surmount. In\ndisplaying his accomplishments to captivate the daughter, he had\nunwittingly made an absolute conquest of the mother, who superintended\nthe conduct of Miss Biddy with such jealous vigilance, that he could\nfind no opportunity of profiting by the progress he had made in her\nheart; for the careful matron would never lose sight of her, no, not\nfor one moment.\n\nHad the old lady given the least intimation to our adventurer, of the\nsentiments she entertained in his behalf, his complaisance was of such\na pliable texture, that he would have quitted his other pursuit, and\nmade her the sole object of his attention. But she either depended upon\nthe effect of his own good taste and discernment, or was too proud to\ndisclose a passion which he had hitherto overlooked.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTY-TWO\n\nREPAIRS TO THE METROPOLIS, AND ENROLS HIMSELF AMONG THE SONS OF PAEAN.\n\nBefore this affair could be brought to a proper explanation, the season\nbeing almost ended, the ladies departed from Tunbridge, and in a little\ntime Doctor Fathom followed them to London, having previously obtained\npermission to visit them in that metropolis. He had solicited the same\nfavour of some other families, in which he hoped to take root, though\nhe knew they were pre-engaged to different physicians; and resolving to\nmake his first medical appearance in London with some eclat, he not\nonly purchased an old chariot, which was new painted for the purpose,\nbut likewise hired a footman, whom he clothed in laced livery, in order\nto distinguish himself from the common run of his brethren.\n\nThis equipage, though much more expensive than his finances could bear,\nhe found absolutely necessary to give him a chance for employment; as\nevery shabby retainer to physic, in this capital, had provided himself\nwith a vehicle, which was altogether used by way of a travelling\nsign-post, to draw in customers; so that a walking physician was\nconsidered as an obscure pedlar, trudging from street to street, with\nhis pack of knowledge on his shoulders, and selling his remnants of\nadvice by retail. A chariot was not now set up for the convenience of a\nman sinking under the fatigue of extensive practice, but as a piece of\nfurniture every way as necessary as a large periwig with three tails;\nand a physician, let his merit, in other respects, be never so\nconspicuous, can no more expect to become considerable in business,\nwithout the assistance of this implement, than he can hope to live\nwithout food, or breathe without a windpipe.\n\nThis requisite is so well understood, that, exclusive of those who\nprofess themselves doctors, every raw surgeon, every idle apothecary,\nwho can make interest with some foolhardy coachmaker, may be seen\ndancing the bays in all places of public resort, and grinning to one\nanother from their respective carriages. Hence proceed many of those\ncruel accidents which are recorded in the daily papers. An apothecary’s\nhorses take fright, and run away with his chariot, which is heard of no\nmore. An eminent surgeon being overturned, is so terrified at the\nthoughts of mutilation, that he resolves to walk on foot all the days\nof his life; and the coachman of a physician of great practice, having\nthe misfortune to be disabled by a fall from the box, his master can\nnever find another to supply his place.\n\nNone of these observations escaped the penetrating eye of Fathom, who,\nbefore he pretended to seat himself in this machine, had made proper\ninquiry into all the other methods practised, with a view to keep the\nwheels in motion. In his researches, he found that the great world was\nwholly engrossed by a few practitioners who had arrived at the summit\nof reputation, consequently were no longer obliged to cultivate those\narts by which they rose; and that the rest of the business was\nparcelled out into small enclosures, occupied by different groups of\npersonages, male and female, who stood in rings, and tossed the ball\nfrom one to another, there being in each department two sets, the\nindividuals of which relieved one another occasionally. Every knot was\ncomposed of a waiting-woman, nurse, apothecary, surgeon, and physician,\nand sometimes a midwife was admitted into the party; and in this manner\nthe farce was commonly performed.\n\nA fine lady, fatigued with idleness, complains of the vapours, is\ndeprived of her rest, though not so sick as to have recourse to\nmedicine. Her favourite maid, tired with giving her attendance in the\nnight, thinks proper, for the benefit of her own repose, to complain of\na violent headache, and recommends to her mistress a nurse of approved\ntenderness and discretion; at whose house, in all likelihood, the said\nchambermaid hath oft given the rendezvous to a male friend. The nurse,\nwell skilled in the mysteries of her occupation, persuades the patient,\nthat her malady, far from being slight or chimerical, may proceed to a\nvery dangerous degree of the hysterical affection, unless it be nipt in\nthe bud by some very effectual remedy. Then she recounts a surprising\ncure performed by a certain apothecary, and appeals to the testimony of\nthe waiting-woman, who being the gossip of his wife, confirms the\nevidence, and corroborates the proposal. The apothecary being summoned,\nfinds her ladyship in such a delicate situation, that he declines\nprescribing, and advises her to send for a physician without delay. The\nnomination of course falls to him, and the doctor being called,\ndeclares the necessity of immediate venesection, which is accordingly\nperformed by a surgeon of the association.\n\nThis is one way of beginning the game. Though the commencement often\nvaries, and sometimes the apothecary and sometimes the physician opens\nthe scene; but, be that as it will, they always appear in a string,\nlike a flight of wild geese, and each confederacy maintains a\ncorrespondence with one particular undertaker. Fathom, upon these\nconsiderations, set up his rest in the first floor of an apothecary in\nthe neighbourhood of Charing Cross, to whom he was introduced by a\nletter from a friend at Tunbridge, and who being made acquainted with\nhis ability and scheme, promised to let slip no opportunity of serving\nhim; and, indeed, seemed to espouse his interest with great alacrity.\nHe introduced him to some of his patients, on the strength of a gratis\nvisit, sounded forth his praise among all the good women of his\nacquaintance; and even prevailed upon him to publish advertisements,\nimporting that he would every day, at a certain time and place, give\nhis advice to the poor for nothing; hoping that, by means of some lucky\ncure, his fame might be extended, and his practice grow into request.\n\nIn the meantime his chariot rolled along through all the most\nfrequented streets, during the whole forenoon, and, at the usual hour,\nhe never failed to make his appearance at the medical coffee-house,\nwith all that solemnity of feature and address, by which the modern\nsons of Paean are distinguished; not but that he was often puzzled\nabout the decision of his diurnal route. For the method of driving up\none street and down another, without halting, was become such a stale\nexpedient, that the very ’prentices used to stand at the shop doors,\nand ridicule the vain parade. At length, however, he perused the map of\nLondon with great diligence, and, having acquired a distinct idea of\nits topography, used to alight at the end of long narrow thoroughfares\nand paved courts, where the chariot was ordered to wait till his\nreturn; and, walking with great gravity through the different turnings\nof these alleys, regain his carriage by another passage, and resume his\nseat with an air of vast importance. With a view to protract the time\nof his supposed visits, he would, at one place, turn aside to a wall;\nat another, cheapen an urinal; at a third corner, read a quack\nadvertisement, or lounge a few minutes in some bookseller’s shop; and,\nlastly, glide into some obscure coffee-house, and treat himself with a\ndram of usquebaugh.\n\nThe other means used to force a trade, such as ordering himself to be\ncalled from church, alarming the neighbourhood with knocking at his\ndoor in the night, receiving sudden messages in places of resort, and\ninserting his cures by way of news in the daily papers, had been so\ninjudiciously hackneyed by every desperate sculler in physic, that they\nhad lost their effect upon the public, and therefore were excluded from\nthe plan of our adventurer, whose scheme, for the present, was to exert\nhimself in winning the favour of those sage Sibyls, who keep, as it\nwere, the temple of medicine, and admit the young priest to the service\nof the altar; but this he considered as a temporary project only, until\nhe should have acquired interest enough to erect an hospital, lock, or\ninfirmary, by the voluntary subscription of his friends, a scheme which\nhad succeeded to a miracle with many of the profession, who had raised\nthemselves into notice upon the carcases of the poor.\n\nYet even this branch was already overstocked, insomuch that almost\nevery street was furnished with one of these charitable receptacles,\nwhich, instead of diminishing the taxes for the maintenance of the\npoor, encouraged the vulgar to be idle and dissolute, by opening an\nasylum to them and their families, from the diseases of poverty and\nintemperance. For it remains to be proved, that the parish rates are\ndecreased, the bills of mortality lessened, the people more numerous,\nor the streets less infested with beggars, notwithstanding the immense\nsums yearly granted by individuals for the relief of the indigent.\n\nBut, waiving these reflections, Doctor Fathom hoped, that his landlord\nwould be a most useful implement for extending his influence, and, for\nthat reason, admitted him into a degree of partnership, after being\nfully convinced that he was not under articles to any other physician.\nNevertheless, he was very much mistaken in reckoning on the importance\nof his new ally, who was, like himself, a needy adventurer, settled\nupon credit, and altogether unemployed, except among the very refuse of\nthe people, whom no other person would take the trouble to attend. So\nthat our hero got little else than experience and trouble, excepting a\nfew guineas which he made shift to glean among sojourners, with whom he\nbecame occasionally acquainted, or young people, who had been\nunfortunate in their amours.\n\nIn the midst of these endeavours, he did not omit his duty to the old\ngentlewoman, whose daughter he had cured at Tunbridge; and was always\nreceived with particular complacency, which, perhaps, he, in some\nmeasure, owed to his genteel equipage, that gave credit to every door\nbefore which it was seen; yet, Miss Biddy was as inaccessible as ever,\nwhile the mother became more and more warm in her civilities, till at\nlength, after having prepared him with some extraordinary compliments,\nshe gave him to understand, that Biddy was no better than a\ngiddy-headed girl, far from being unexceptionable in her moral\ncharacter, and particularly deficient in duty and gratitude to her, who\nhad been always a tender and indulgent parent; she was therefore\ndetermined to punish the young minx for her levity and want of natural\naffection, by altering her own condition, could she find a worthy and\nagreeable man, on whom she could bestow her hand and fortune without a\nblush.\n\nThe film was instantly removed from Fathom’s eyes by this declaration,\nwhich she uttered with such a significancy of look, as thrilled to his\nsoul with joyful presage, while he replied, it would, indeed, be a\ndifficult task to find a man who merited such happiness and honour;\nbut, surely, some there were, who would task their faculties to the\nuttermost, in manifesting their gratitude, and desire of rendering\nthemselves worthy of such distinction. Though this answer was\npronounced in such a manner as gave her to understand he had taken the\nhint, she would not cheapen her condescension so much as to explain\nherself further at that juncture, and he was very well contented to woo\nher on her own terms; accordingly he began to season his behaviour with\na spice of gallantry, when he had opportunities of being particular\nwith this new inamorata, and, in proportion to the returns she made, he\ngradually detached himself from Miss Biddy, by intermitting, and, at\nlast, discontinuing those ardent expressions of love and admiration,\nwhich he had made shift to convey in private looks and stolen whispers,\nduring the rancorous inspection of her mother.\n\nSuch alteration could not long escape the jealous eyes of the young\nlady, no more than the cause of this alienation, which, in a moment,\nconverted all her love into irreconcilable hate, and filled her whole\nsoul with the most eager desire of vengeance. For she now not only\nconsidered him as a mercenary wretch, who had slighted her attractions\nfor the sordid gratifications of avarice, but also as an interloper,\nwho wanted to intercept her fortune, in the odious character of a\nfather-in-law. But, before she could bring her aim to any ripeness of\ncontrivance, her mother, having caught cold at church, was seized with\na rheumatic fever, became delirious in less than three days, and,\nnotwithstanding all the prescriptions and care of her admirer, gave up\nthe ghost, without having retrieved the use of her senses, or been able\nto manifest, by will, the sentiments she entertained in favour of her\nphysician, who, as the reader will easily perceive, had more reasons\nthan one to be mortally chagrined at this event.\n\nMiss Biddy being thus put in possession of the whole inheritance, not\nonly renounced all correspondence with Doctor Fathom, by forbidding him\nthe house, but likewise took all opportunities of prejudicing his\ncharacter, by hinting, that her dear mamma had fallen a sacrifice to\nhis ignorance and presumption.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTY-THREE\n\nACQUIRES EMPLOYMENT IN CONSEQUENCE OF A LUCKY MISCARRIAGE.\n\nThese ill offices, however, far from answering her purpose, had a quite\ncontrary effect. For, in consequence of her invectives, he was, in a\nfew days, called to the wife of a merchant, who piously hoped, that his\npractice would not give Miss Biddy the lie. The patient had long\nlingered under a complication of distempers, and being in no immediate\ndanger of her life, Doctor Fathom was in no hurry to strike a decisive\nstroke; till the husband growing impatient of delay, and so explicit in\nhis hints, that it was impossible to misapprehend his meaning, our\nadventurer resolved to do something effectual for his satisfaction, and\nprescribed a medicine of such rough operation, as he thought must\neither oblige his employer, or produce a change in the lady’s\nconstitution, that would make a noise in the world, and bring a new\naccession to his fame.\n\nProceeding upon these maxims, he could not be disappointed. The remedy\nplayed its part with such violence, as reduced the patient to\nextremity, and the merchant had actually bespoke an undertaker; when,\nafter a series of swoonings and convulsions, nature so far prevailed,\nas to expel, at once, the prescription and the disease; yet the\ngood-natured husband was so much affected with the agonies to which he\nsaw the wife of his bosom exposed by this specific, that, although the\neffect of it was her perfect recovery, he could never bear the sight of\nFathom for the future, nor even hear his name mentioned, without giving\nsigns of horror and indignation. Nay, he did not scruple to affirm,\nthat, had our adventurer been endowed with the least tincture of\nhumanity, he would have suffered the poor woman to depart in peace,\nrather than restore her to health, at the expense of such anxiety and\ntorture.\n\nOn the other hand, this extraordinary cure was blazoned abroad by the\ngood lady and her gossips, with such exaggerations as roused the\nastonishment of the public, and concurred with the report of his last\nmiscarriage to bring him upon the carpet, as the universal subject of\ndiscourse. When a physician becomes the town talk, he generally\nconcludes his business more than half done, even though his fame should\nwholly turn upon his malpractice; insomuch that some members of the\nfaculty have been heard to complain, that they never had the good\nfortune to be publicly accused of homicide; and it is well known, that\na certain famous empiric, of our day, never flourished to any degree of\nwealth and reputation till after he had been attacked in print, and\nfairly convicted of having destroyed a good number of the human\nspecies. Success raised upon such a foundation would, by a disciple of\nPlato, and some modern moralists, be ascribed to the innate virtue and\ngenerosity of the human heart, which naturally espouses the cause that\nneeds protection. But I, whose notions of human excellence are not\nquite so sublime, am apt to believe it is owing to that spirit of\nself-conceit and contradiction, which is, at least, as universal, if\nnot as natural, as the moral sense so warmly contended for by those\nideal philosophers.\n\nThe most infamous wretch often finds his account in these principles of\nmalevolence and self-love. For wheresoever his character falls under\ndiscussion there is generally some person present, who, either from an\naffectation of singularity, or envy to the accusers, undertakes his\ndefence, and endeavours to invalidate the articles of his impeachment,\nuntil he is heated by altercation, and hurried into more effectual\nmeasures for his advantage. If such benefits accrue to those who have\nno real merit to depend upon, surely our hero could not but reap\nsomething extraordinary from the debates to which he now gave rise; as,\nby the miraculous cure he had affected, all his patient’s friends, all\nthe enemies of her husband, all those who envied his other adversary,\nwere interested in his behalf, exclusive of such admirers as surprise\nand curiosity might engage in his cause.\n\nThus wafted upon the wings of applause, his fame soon diffused itself\ninto all the corners of this great capital. The newspapers teemed with\nhis praise; and in order to keep up the attention of the public, his\nemissaries, male and female, separated into different coffee-houses,\ncompanies, and clubs, where they did not fail to comment upon these\narticles of intelligence. Such a favourable incident is, of itself,\nsufficient to float the bark of a man’s fortune. He was, in a few days,\ncalled to another lady, labouring under the same disorder he had so\nsuccessfully dispelled, and she thought herself benefited by his\nadvice. His acquaintance naturally extended itself among the visitants\nand allies of his patients; he was recommended from family to family;\nthe fees began to multiply; a variety of footmen appeared every day at\nhis door; he discontinued his sham circuit, and looking upon the\npresent conjuncture, as that tide in his affairs, which, according to\nShakespeare, when taken at the full, leads on to fortune, he resolved\nthat the opportunity should not be lost, and applied himself with such\nassiduity to his practice, that, in all likelihood, he would have\ncarried the palm from all his contemporaries, had he not split upon the\nsame rock which had shipwrecked his hopes before.\n\nWe have formerly descanted upon that venereal appetite which glowed in\nthe constitution of our adventurer, and with all his philosophy and\ncaution could hardly keep within bounds. The reader, therefore, will\nnot be much surprised to learn, that, in the exercise of his\nprofession, he contracted an intimacy with a clergyman’s wife, whom he\nattended as a physician, and whose conjugal virtue he subdued by a long\nand diligent exertion of his delusive arts, while her mind was\nenervated by sickness, and her husband abroad upon his necessary\noccasions. This unhappy patient, who was a woman of an agreeable person\nand lively conversation, fell a sacrifice to her own security and\nself-conceit; her want of health had confined her to a sedentary life,\nand her imagination being active and restless, she had spent those\nhours in reading which other young women devote to company and\ndiversion, but, as her studies were not superintended by any person of\ntaste, she had indulged her own fancy without method or propriety. The\nSpectator taught her to be a critic and philosopher; from plays she\nlearned poetry and wit, and derived her knowledge of life from books of\nhistory and adventures. Fraught with these acquisitions, and furnished\nby nature with uncommon vivacity, she despised her own sex, and courted\nthe society of men, among whom she thought her talents might be more\nhonourably displayed, fully confident of her own virtue and sagacity,\nwhich enabled her to set all their arts at defiance.\n\nThus qualified, she, in an evil hour, had recourse to the advice of our\nadventurer, for some ailment under which she had long laboured, and\nfound such relief from his skill as very much prepossessed her in his\nfavour. She was no less pleased with his obliging manners than with his\nphysic, and found much entertainment in his conversation, so that the\nacquaintance proceeded to a degree of intimacy, during which he\nperceived her weak side, and being enamoured of her person, flattered\nher out of all her caution. The privilege of his character furnished\nhim with opportunities to lay snares for her virtue, and, taking\nadvantage of that listlessness, languor, and indolence of the spirits,\nby which all the vigilance of the soul is relaxed, he, after a long\ncourse of attention and perseverance, found means to make shipwreck of\nher peace.\n\nThough he mastered her chastity, he could not quiet her conscience,\nwhich incessantly upbraided her with breach of the marriage vow; nor\ndid her undoer escape without a share of the reproaches suggested by\nher penitence and remorse. This internal anxiety co-operating with her\ndisease, and perhaps with the medicines he prescribed, reduced her to\nthe brink of the grave; when her husband returned from a neighbouring\nkingdom, in consequence of her earnest request, joined to the\ninformation of her friends, who had written to him an account of the\nextremity in which she was. The good man was afflicted beyond measure\nwhen he saw himself upon the verge of losing a wife whom he had always\ntenderly loved; but what were his emotions, when she, taking the first\nopportunity of his being alone with her, accosted him to this effect:\n\n“I am now hastening towards that dissolution from which no mortal is\nexempted, and though the prospect of futurity is altogether clouded and\nuncertain, my conscience will not allow me to plunge into eternity\nwithout unburdening my mind, and, by an ingenuous confession, making\nall the atonement in my power for the ingratitude I have been guilty\nof, and the wrongs I have committed against a virtuous husband, who\nnever gave me cause of complaint. You stand amazed at this preamble,\nbut alas! how will you be shocked when I own that I have betrayed you\nin your absence, that I have trespassed against God and my marriage\nvow, and fallen from the pride and confidence of virtue to the most\nabject state of vice; yes, I have been unfaithful to your bed, having\nfallen a victim to the infernal insinuations of a villain, who took\nadvantage of my weak and unguarded moments. Fathom is the wretch who\nhath thus injured your honour, and ruined my unsuspecting innocence. I\nhave nothing to plead in alleviation of my crime but the most sincere\ncontrition of heart, and though, at any other juncture, I could not\nexpect your forgiveness, yet, as I now touch the goal of life, I trust\nin your humanity and benevolence for that pardon which will lighten the\nsorrows of my soul, and those prayers which I hope will entitle me to\nfavour at the throne of grace.”\n\nThe poor husband was so much overwhelmed with grief and confusion at\nthis unexpected address that he could not recollect himself till after\na pause of several minutes, when uttering a hollow groan, “I will not,”\nsaid he, “aggravate your sufferings, by reproaching you with my wrongs,\nthough your conduct hath been but an ill return for all my tenderness\nand esteem. I look upon it as a trial of my Christian patience, and\nbear my misfortune with resignation; meanwhile, I forgive you from my\nheart, and fervently pray that your repentance may be acceptable to the\nFather of Mercy.” So saying, he approached her bedside, and embraced\nher in token of his sincerity. Whether this generous condescension\ndiffused such a composure upon her spirits as tended to the ease and\nrefreshment of nature, which had been almost exhausted by disease and\nvexation, certain it is, that from this day she began to struggle with\nher malady in surprising efforts, and hourly gained ground, until her\nhealth was pretty well re-established.\n\nThis recovery was so far beyond the husband’s expectation, that he\nbegan to make very serious reflections on the event, and even to wish\nhe had not been quite so precipitate in pardoning the backslidings of\nhis wife; for, though he could not withhold his compassion from a dying\npenitent, he did not at all relish the thoughts of cohabiting, as\nusual, with a wife self-convicted of the violation of the matrimonial\ncontract; he therefore considered his declaration as no more than a\nprovisional pardon, to take place on condition of her immediate death,\nand, in a little time, not only communicated to her his sentiments on\nthis subject, but also separated himself from her company, secured the\nevidence of her maid, who had been confidant in her amour with Fathom,\nand immediately set on foot a prosecution against our adventurer, whose\nbehaviour to his wife he did not fail to promulgate, with all its\naggravating circumstances. By these means the doctor’s name became so\nnotorious that every man was afraid of admitting him into his house,\nand every woman ashamed of soliciting his advice.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR\n\nHIS ECLIPSE, AND GRADUAL DECLINATION.\n\nMisfortunes seldom come single; upon the back of this hue and cry he\nunluckily prescribed phlebotomy to a gentleman of some rank, who\nchanced to expire during the operation, and quarrelled with his\nlandlord the apothecary, who charged him with having forgot the good\noffices he had done him in the beginning of his career, and desired he\nwould provide himself with another lodging.\n\nAll these mishaps, treading upon the heels of one another, had a very\nmortifying effect upon his practice. At every tea-table his name was\noccasionally put to the torture, with that of the vile creature whom he\nhad seduced, though it was generally taken for granted by all those\nfemale casuists, that she must have made the first advances, for it\ncould not be supposed that any man would take much trouble in laying\nschemes for the ruin of a person whose attractions were so slender,\nespecially considering the ill state of her health, a circumstance that\nseldom adds to a woman’s beauty or good-humour; besides, she was always\na pert minx, that affected singularity, and a masculine manner of\nspeaking, and many of them had foreseen that she would, some time or\nother, bring herself into such a premunire. At all gossipings, where\nthe apothecary or his wife assisted, Fathom’s pride, ingratitude, and\nmalpractice were canvassed; in all clubs of married men he was\nmentioned with marks of abhorrence and detestation, and every medical\ncoffee-house rung with his reproach. Instances of his ignorance and\npresumption were quoted, and many particulars feigned for the purpose\nof defamation, so that our hero was exactly in the situation of a\nhorseman, who, in riding at full speed for the plate, is thrown from\nthe saddle in the middle of the race, and left without sense or motion\nupon the plain.\n\nHis progress, though rapid, had been so short, that he could not be\nsupposed to have laid up store against such a day of trouble, and as he\nstill cherished hopes of surmounting those obstacles which had so\nsuddenly started up in his way, he would not resign his equipage nor\nretrench his expenses, but appeared as usual in all public places with\nthat serenity and confidence of feature which he had never deposited,\nand maintained his external pomp upon the little he had reserved in the\ndays of his prosperity, and the credit he had acquired by the\npunctuality of his former payments. Both these funds, however, failed\nin a very little time, his lawsuit was a gulf that swallowed up all his\nready money, and the gleanings of his practice were scarce sufficient\nto answer his pocket expenses, which now increased in proportion to the\ndecrease of business, for, as he had more idle time, and was less\nadmitted into private families, so he thought he had more occasion to\nenlarge his acquaintance among his own sex, who alone were able to\nsupport him in his disgrace with the other. He accordingly listed\nhimself in several clubs, and endeavoured to monopolise the venereal\nbranch of trade, though this was but an indifferent resource, for\nalmost all his patients of this class were such as either could not, or\nwould not, properly recompense the physician.\n\nFor some time he lingered in this situation, without going upwards or\ndownwards, floating like a wisp of straw at the turning of the tide,\nuntil he could no longer amuse the person of whom he had hired his\ncoach-horses, or postpone the other demands, which multiplied upon him\nevery day. Then was his chariot overturned with a hideous crash, and\nhis face so much wounded with the shivers of the glass, which went to\npieces in the fall, that he appeared in the coffee-house with half a\ndozen black patches upon his countenance, gave a most circumstantial\ndetail of the risk he had run, and declared, that he did not believe he\nshould ever hazard himself again in any sort of wheel carriage.\n\nSoon after this accident, he took an opportunity of telling his\nfriends, in the same public place, that he had turned away his footman\non account of his drunkenness, and was resolved, for the future, to\nkeep none but maids in his service, because the menservants are\ngenerally impudent, lazy, debauched, or dishonest; and after all,\nneither so neat, handy, or agreeable as the other sex. In the rear of\nthis resolution, he shifted his lodgings into a private court, being\ndistracted with the din of carriages, that disturb the inhabitants who\nlive towards the open street; and gave his acquaintance to understand,\nthat he had a medical work upon the anvil, which he could not finish\nwithout being indulged in silence and tranquillity. In effect, he\ngradually put on the exteriors of an author. His watch, with an\nhorizontal movement by Graham, which he had often mentioned, and shown\nas a very curious piece of workmanship, began, about this time, to be\nvery much out of order, and was committed to the care of a mender, who\nwas in no hurry to restore it. His tie-wig degenerated into a major; he\nsometimes appeared without a sword, and was even observed in public\nwith a second day’s shirt. At last, his clothes became rusty; and when\nhe walked about the streets, his head turned round in a surprising\nmanner, by an involuntary motion in his neck, which he had contracted\nby a habit of reconnoitring the ground, that he might avoid all\ndangerous or disagreeable encounters.\n\nFathom, finding himself descending the hill of fortune with an acquired\ngravitation, strove to catch at every twig, in order to stop or retard\nhis descent. He now regretted the opportunities he had neglected, of\nmarrying one of several women of moderate fortune, who had made\nadvances to him in the zenith of his reputation; and endeavoured, by\nforcing himself into a lower path of life than any he had hitherto\ntrod, to keep himself afloat, with the portion of some tradesman’s\ndaughter, whom he meant to espouse. While he exerted himself in this\npursuit, he happened, in returning from a place about thirty miles from\nLondon, to become acquainted, in the stage-coach, with a young woman of\na very homely appearance, whom, from the driver’s information, he\nunderstood to be the niece of a country justice, and daughter of a\nsoap-boiler, who had lived and died in London, and left her, in her\ninfancy, sole heiress of his effects, which amounted to four thousand\npounds. The uncle, who was her guardian, had kept her sacred from the\nknowledge of the world, resolving to effect a match betwixt her and his\nown son; and it was with much difficulty he had consented to this\njourney, which she had undertaken as a visit to her own mother, who had\nmarried a second husband in town.\n\nFraught with these anecdotes, Fathom began to put forth his gallantry\nand good-humour, and, in a word, was admitted by the lady to the\nprivilege of an acquaintance, in which capacity he visited her during\nthe term of her residence in London; and, as there was no time to be\nlost, declared his honourable intentions. He had such a manifest\nadvantage, in point of personal accomplishments, over the young\ngentleman who was destined for her husband, that she did not disdain\nhis proposals; and, before she set out for the country, he had made\nsuch progress in her heart, that the day was actually fixed for their\nnuptials, on which he faithfully promised to carry her off in a coach\nand six. How to raise money for this expedition was all the difficulty\nthat remained; for, by this time, his finances were utterly dried up,\nand his credit altogether exhausted. Upon a very pressing occasion, he\nhad formerly applied himself to a certain wealthy quack, who had\nrelieved his necessities by lending him a small sum of money, in return\nfor having communicated to him a secret medicine, which he affirmed to\nbe the most admirable specific that ever was invented. The nostrum had\nbeen used, and, luckily for him, succeeded in the trial; so that the\nempiric, in the midst of his satisfaction, began to reflect, that this\nsame Fathom, who pretended to be in possession of a great many\nremedies, equally efficacious, would certainly become a formidable\nrival to him in his business, should he ever be able to extricate\nhimself from his present difficulties.\n\nIn consequence of these suggestions, he resolved to keep our\nadventurer’s head under water, by maintaining him in the most abject\ndependence. Accordingly he had, from time to time, accommodated him\nwith small trifles, which barely served to support his existence, and\neven for these had taken notes of hand, that he might have a scourge\nover his head, in case he should prove insolent or refractory. To this\nbenefactor Fathom applied for a reinforcement of twenty guineas, which\nhe solicited with the more confidence, as that sum would certainly\nenable him to repay all other obligations. The quack would advance the\nmoney upon no other condition, than that of knowing the scheme, which\nbeing explained, he complied with Ferdinand’s request; but, at the same\ntime, privately despatched an express to the young lady’s uncle, with a\nfull account of the whole conspiracy; so that, when the doctor arrived\nat the inn, according to appointment, he was received by his worship in\nperson, who gave him to understand, that his niece had changed her\nmind, and gone fifty miles farther into the country to visit a\nrelation. This was a grievous disappointment to Fathom, who really\nbelieved his mistress had forsaken him through mere levity and caprice,\nand was not undeceived till several months after her marriage with her\ncousin, when, at an accidental meeting in London, she explained the\nstory of the secret intelligence, and excused her marriage, as the\neffect of rigorous usage and compulsion.\n\nHad our hero been really enamoured of her person, he might have\nprobably accomplished his wishes, notwithstanding the steps she had\ntaken. But this was not the case. His passion was of a different\nnature, and the object of it effectually without his reach. With regard\nto his appetite for women, as it was an infirmity of his constitution,\nwhich he could not overcome, and as he was in no condition to gratify\nit at a great expense, he had of late chosen a housekeeper from the\nhundreds of Drury, and, to avoid scandal, allowed her to assume his\nname. As to the intimation which had been sent to the country justice,\nhe immediately imputed it to the true author, whom he marked for his\nvengeance accordingly; but, in the meantime, suppressed his resentment,\nbecause he in some measure depended upon him for subsistence. On the\nother hand, the quack, dreading the forwardness and plausibility of our\nhero, which might, one time or other, render him independent, put a\nstop to those supplies, on pretence of finding them inconvenient; but,\nout of his friendship and goodwill to Fathom, undertook to procure for\nhim such letters of recommendation as would infallibly make his fortune\nin the West Indies, and even to set him out in a genteel manner for the\nvoyage. Ferdinand perceived his drift, and thanked him for his generous\noffer, which he would not fail to consider with all due deliberation;\nthough he was determined against the proposal, but obliged to\ntemporise, that he might not incur the displeasure of this man, at\nwhose mercy he lay. Meanwhile the prosecution against him in Doctors’\nCommons drew near a period, and the lawyers were clamorous for money,\nwithout which, he foresaw he should lose the advantage which his cause\nhad lately acquired by the death of his antagonist’s chief evidence; he\ntherefore, seeing every other channel shut up, began to doubt, whether\nthe risk of being apprehended or slain in the character of a\nhighwayman, was not overbalanced by the prospect of being acquitted of\na charge which had ruined his reputation and fortune, and actually\nentertained thoughts of taking the air on Hounslow Heath, when he was\ndiverted from this expedient by a very singular adventure.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE\n\nAFTER DIVERS UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS, HE HAS RECOURSE TO THE MATRIMONIAL\nNOOSE.\n\nChancing to meet with one of his acquaintance at a certain\ncoffee-house, the discourse turned upon the characters of mankind,\nwhen, among other oddities, his friend brought upon the carpet a\ncertain old gentlewoman of such a rapacious disposition, that, like a\njackdaw, she never beheld any metalline substance, without an\ninclination, and even an effort to secrete it for her own use and\ncontemplation. Nor was this infirmity originally produced from\nindigence, inasmuch as her circumstances had been always affluent, and\nshe was now possessed of a considerable sum of money in the funds;\nnotwithstanding which, the avarice of her nature tempted her to let\nlodgings, though few people could live under the same roof with such an\noriginal, who, rather than be idle, had often filched pieces of her own\nplate, and charged her servants with the theft, or hinted suspicion of\nher lodgers. Fathom, struck with the description, soon perceived how\nthis woman’s disease might be converted to his advantage; and after\nhaving obtained sufficient intelligence, on pretence of satisfying his\ncuriosity, he visited the widow, in consequence of a bill at her door,\nand actually hired an apartment in her house, whither he forthwith\nrepaired with his inamorata.\n\nIt was not long before he perceived that his landlady’s character had\nnot been misrepresented. He fed her distemper with divers\ninconsiderable trinkets, such as copper medals, corkscrews, odd\nbuckles, and a paltry seal set in silver, which were, at different\ntimes, laid as baits for her infirmity, and always conveyed away with\nremarkable eagerness, which he and his Dulcinea took pleasure in\nobserving from an unsuspected place. Thus confirmed in his opinion, he,\nat length, took an opportunity of exposing a metal watch that belonged\nto his mistress, and saw it seized with great satisfaction, in the\nabsence of his helpmate, who had gone abroad on purpose. According to\ninstruction, she soon returned, and began to raise a terrible clamour\nabout the loss of her watch; upon which she was condoled by her\nlandlady, who seemed to doubt the integrity of the maid, and even\nproposed that Mrs. Fathom should apply to some justice of the peace for\na warrant to search the servant’s trunk. The lady thanked her for the\ngood advice, in compliance with which she had immediate recourse to a\nmagistrate, who granted a search warrant, not against the maid, but the\nmistress; and she, in a little time, returned with the constable at her\nback.\n\nThese precautions being taken, Doctor Fathom desired a private\nconference with the old gentlewoman, in which he gave her to\nunderstand, that he had undoubted proofs of her having secreted, not\nonly the watch, but also several other odd things of less consequence,\nwhich he lost since his residence in her house. He then showed the\nwarrant he had obtained against her, and asked if she had anything to\noffer why the constable should not do his duty? Inexpressible were the\nanguish and confusion of the defendant, when she found herself thus\nentrapped, and reflected, that she was on the point of being detected\nof felony; for she at once concluded, that the snare was laid for her,\nand knew that the officer of justice would certainly find the unlucky\nwatch in one of the drawers of her scrutoire.\n\nTortured with these suggestions, afraid of public disgrace, and\ndreading the consequence of legal conviction, she fell on her knees\nbefore the injured Fathom, and, after having imputed her crime to the\ntemptations of necessity, implored his compassion, promised to restore\nthe watch, and everything she had taken, and begged he would dismiss\nthe constable, that her reputation might not suffer in the eye of the\nworld.\n\nFerdinand, with a severity of countenance purposely assumed, observed\nthat, were she really indigent, he had charity enough to forgive what\nshe had done; but, as he knew her circumstances were opulent, he looked\nupon this excuse as an aggravation of her guilt, which was certainly\nthe effect of a vicious inclination; and he was therefore determined to\nprosecute her with the utmost severity of the law, as an example and\nterror to others, who might be infected with the same evil disposition.\nFinding him deaf to all her tears and entreaties, she changed her note,\nand offered him one hundred guineas, if he would compromise the affair,\nand drop the prosecution, so as that her character should sustain no\ndamage. After much argumentation, he consented to accept of double the\nsum, which being instantly paid in East India bonds, Doctor Fathom told\nthe constable, that the watch was found; and for once her reputation\nwas patched up. This seasonable supply enabled our hero to stand trial\nwith his adversary, who was nonsuited, and also to mend his external\nappearance, which of late had not been extremely magnificent.\n\nSoon after this gleam of good fortune, a tradesman, to whom he was\nconsiderably indebted, seeing no other probable means to recover his\nmoney, introduced Fathom to the acquaintance of a young widow who\nlodged at his house, and was said to be in possession of a considerable\nfortune. Considering the steps that were taken, it would have been\nalmost impossible for him to miscarry in his addresses. The lady had\nbeen bred in the country, was unacquainted with the world, and of a\nvery sanguine disposition, which her short trial of matrimony had not\nserved to cool. Our adventurer was instructed to call at the\ntradesman’s house, as if by accident, at an appointed time, when the\nwidow was drinking tea with her landlady. On these occasions he always\nbehaved to admiration. She liked his person, and praised his\npoliteness, good-humour, and good sense; his confederates extolled him\nas a prodigy of learning, taste, and good-nature; they likewise\nrepresented him as a person on the eve of eclipsing all his competitors\nin physic. An acquaintance and intimacy soon ensued, nor was he\nrestricted in point of opportunity. In a word, he succeeded in his\nendeavours, and, one evening, on pretence of attending her to the play,\nhe accompanied her to the Fleet, where they were married, in presence\nof the tradesman and his wife, who were of the party.\n\nThis grand affair being accomplished to his satisfaction, he, next day,\nvisited her brother, who was a counsellor of the Temple, to make him\nacquainted with the step his sister had taken; and though the lawyer\nwas not a little mortified to find that she had made such a clandestine\nmatch, he behaved civilly to his new brother-in-law, and gave him to\nunderstand, that his wife’s fortune consisted of a jointure of one\nhundred and fifty pounds a year, and fifteen hundred pounds bequeathed\nto her during her widowhood, by her own father, who had taken the\nprecaution of settling it in the hands of trustees, in such a manner as\nthat any husband she might afterwards espouse should be restricted from\nencroaching upon the capital, which was reserved for the benefit of her\nheirs. This intimation was far from being agreeable to our hero, who\nhad been informed, that this sum was absolutely at the lady’s disposal,\nand had actually destined the greatest part of it for the payment of\nhis debts, for defraying the expense of furnishing an elegant house,\nand setting up a new equipage.\n\nNotwithstanding this disappointment, he resolved to carry on his plan\nupon the credit of his marriage, which was published in a very pompous\narticle of the newspapers; a chariot was bespoke, a ready furnished\nhouse immediately taken, and Doctor Fathom began to reappear in all his\nformer splendour.\n\nHis good friend the empiric, alarmed at this event, which not only\nraised our adventurer into the sphere of a dangerous rival, but also\nfurnished him with means to revenge the ill office he had sustained at\nhis hands on the adventure of the former match—for, by this time,\nFathom had given him some hints, importing, that he was not ignorant of\nhis treacherous behaviour—roused, I say, by these considerations, he\nemployed one of his emissaries, who had some knowledge of Fathom’s\nbrother-in-law, to prejudice him against our adventurer, whom he\nrepresented as a needy sharper, not only overwhelmed with debt and\ndisgrace, but likewise previously married to a poor woman, who was\nprevented by nothing but want from seeking redress at law. To confirm\nthese assertions, he gave him a detail of Fathom’s encumbrances, which\nhe had learned for the purpose, and even brought the counsellor into\ncompany with the person who had lived with our hero before marriage,\nand who was so much incensed at her abrupt dismission, that she did not\nscruple to corroborate these allegations of the informer.\n\nThe lawyer, startled at this intelligence, set on foot a minute inquiry\ninto the life and conversation of the doctor, which turned out so\nlittle to the advantage of his character and circumstances, that he\nresolved, if possible, to disunite him from his family; and, as a\nprevious step, repeated to his sister all that he had heard to the\nprejudice of her husband, not forgetting to produce the evidence of his\nmistress, who laid claim to him by a prior title, which, she pretended,\ncould be proved by the testimony of the clergyman who joined them. Such\nan explanation could not fail to inflame the resentment of the injured\nwife, who, at the very first opportunity, giving a loose to the\nimpetuosity of her temper, upbraided our hero with the most bitter\ninvectives for his perfidious dealing.\n\nFerdinand, conscious of his own innocence, which he had not always to\nplead, far from attempting to soothe her indignation, assumed the\nauthority and prerogative of a husband, and sharply reprehended her for\nher credulity and indecent warmth. This rebuke, instead of silencing,\ngave new spirit and volubility to her reproaches, in the course of\nwhich she plainly taxed him with want of honesty and affection, and\nsaid that, though his pretence was love, his aim was no other than a\nbase design upon her fortune.\n\nFathom, stung with these accusations, which he really did not deserve,\nreplied with uncommon heat, and charged her in his turn with want of\nsincerity and candour, in the false account she had given of that same\nfortune before marriage. He even magnified his own condescension, in\nsurrendering his liberty to a woman who had so little to recommend her\nto the addresses of the other sex; a reflection which provoked this\nmild creature to such a degree of animosity, that, forgetting her duty\nand allegiance, she lent him a box on the ear with such energy as made\nhis eyes water; and he, for the honour of manhood and sovereignty,\nhaving washed her face with a dish of tea, withdrew abruptly to a\ncoffee-house in the neighbourhood, where he had not long remained, when\nhis passion subsided, and he then saw the expediency of an immediate\nreconciliation, which he resolved to purchase, even at the expense of a\nsubmission.\n\nIt was pity that such a salutary resolution had not been sooner taken.\nFor, when he returned to his own house, he understood, that Mrs. Fathom\nhad gone abroad in a hackney-coach; and, upon examining her apartment,\nin lieu of her clothes and trinkets, which she had removed with\nadmirable dexterity and despatch, he found this billet in one of the\ndrawers of her bureau:—“Sir, being convinced that you are a cheat and\nan impostor, I have withdrawn myself from your cruelty and\nmachinations, with a view to solicit the protection of the law; and I\ndoubt not but I shall soon be able to prove, that you have no just\ntitle to, or demand upon, the person or effects of the unfortunate\nSarah Muddy.”\n\nThe time had been when Mr. Fathom would have allowed Mrs. Muddy to\nrefine at her leisure, and blessed God for his happy deliverance; but\nat present the case was quite altered. Smarting as he was from the\nexpense of lawsuits, he dreaded a prosecution for bigamy, which, though\nhe had justice on his side, he knew he could not of himself support.\nBesides, all his other schemes of life were frustrated by this unlucky\nelopement. He therefore speedily determined to anticipate, as much as\nin him lay, the malice of his enemies, and to obtain, without delay,\nauthentic documents of his marriage. With this view, he hastened to the\nhouse of the tradesman, who, with his wife, had been witness to the\nceremony and consummation; and, in order to interest them the more\nwarmly in his cause, made a pathetic recital of this unhappy breach, in\nwhich he had suffered such injury and insult. But all his rhetoric\nwould not avail. Mrs. Muddy had been beforehand with him, and had\nproved the better orator of the two; for she had assailed this honest\ncouple with such tropes and figures of eloquence, as were altogether\nirresistible.\n\nNevertheless, they heard our hero to an end, with great patience. Then\nthe wife, who was the common mouth upon all such occasions, contracting\nher features into a very formal disposition, “I’ll assure you,” said\nshe, “Doctor Fathom, my husband and I have been in a very great\nterrification and numplush, to hear such bad things of a person, whom,\nas one may say, we thought a worthy gentleman, and were ready to serve\nat all times, by day and by night, as the saying is. And besides, for\nall that, you know, and God knows, as we are dustrious people, and work\nhard for what we get, and we have served gentlemen to our own harm,\nwhereby my husband was last Tuesday served with a siserary, being that\nhe was bound for an officer that ran away. And I said to my husband,\nTimothy, says I, ’tis a very hard thing for one to ruin one’s self for\nstranger people—There’s Doctor Fathom, says I, his account comes to\nnine-and-forty pounds seven shillings and fourpence halfpenny; and you\nknow, doctor, that was before your last bill began. But, howsomever,\nlittle did I think, as how a gentleman of your learning would go to\ndeceive a poor gentlewoman, when you had another wife alive.”\n\nIn vain did our adventurer endeavour to vindicate himself from this\naspersion; the good woman, like a great many modern disputants,\nproceeded with her declamation, without seeming to hear what was said\non the other side of the question; and the husband was altogether\nneutral. At length, Ferdinand, finding all his protestations\nineffectual, “Well,” said he, “though you are resolved, I see, to\ndiscredit all that I can say in opposition to that scandalous slander,\nof which I can easily acquit myself in a court of justice, surely you\nwill not refuse to grant me a certificate, signifying that you were\npresent at the ceremony of my marriage with this unhappy woman.” “You\nshall excuse us,” replied the female orator; “people cannot be too wary\nin signing their names in this wicked world; many a one has been\nbrought to ruination by signing his name, and my husband shall not,\nwith my goodwill, draw himself into such a primmineery.”\n\nFathom, alarmed at this refusal, earnestly argued against the\ninhumanity and injustice of it, appealing to their own consciences for\nthe reasonableness of his proposal; but, from the evasive answers of\nthe wife, he had reason to believe, that, long before the time of\ntrial, they would take care to have forgotten the whole transaction.\n\nThough he was equally confounded and incensed at this instance of their\nperfidy, he durst not manifest his indignation, conscious of the\nadvantage they had over him in divers respects; but repaired, without\nloss of time, to the lodging of the clergyman who had noosed him,\nresolved to consult his register, and secure his evidence. Here too his\nevil genius had got the start of him; for the worthy ecclesiastic not\nonly could not recollect his features, or find his name in the\nregister, but, when importuned by his pressing remonstrances, took\numbrage at the freedom of his behaviour, and threatened, if he would\nnot immediately take himself away, to raise the posse of the Fleet, for\nthe safety of his own person.\n\nRather than put the pastor to the trouble of alarming his flock, he\nretreated with a heavy heart, and went in quest of his mistress, whom\nhe had dismissed at his marriage, in hopes of effecting a\nreconciliation, and preventing her from joining in the conspiracy\nagainst him. But, alas! he met with such a reception as he had reason\nto expect from a slighted woman, who had never felt any real attachment\nfor his person. She did not upbraid him with his cruelty in leaving her\nas a mistress, but, with a species of effrontery never enough to be\nadmired, reproached him with his villany, in abandoning her, who was\nhis true and lawful wife, to go and ruin a poor gentlewoman, by whose\nfortune he had been allured.\n\nWhen he attempted to expostulate with this virago, upon the barbarity\nof this assertion, she very prudently declined engaging in private\nconversation with such an artful and wicked man; and, calling up the\npeople of the house, insisted upon his being conducted to the door.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTY-SIX\n\nIN WHICH HIS FORTUNE IS EFFECTUALLY STRANGLED.\n\nThe last resource, and that upon which he least depended, was the\nadvice and assistance of his old friend the empiric, with whom he still\nmaintained a slight correspondence; and to whose house he steered his\ncourse, in great perplexity and tribulation. That gentleman, instead of\nconsoling him with assurances of friendship and protection, faithfully\nrecapitulated all the instances of his indiscretion and misconduct,\ntaxed him with want of sincerity in the West India affair, as well as\nwith want of honesty in this last marriage, while his former wife was\nalive; and, finally, reminded him of his notes, which he desired might\nbe immediately taken up, as he (the quack) had present occasion for a\nsum of money.\n\nFerdinand, seeing it would be impracticable to derive any succour from\nthis quarter, sneaked homewards, in order to hold a consultation with\nhis own thoughts; and the first object that presented itself to his\neyes when he entered his apartment, was a letter from the tradesman,\nwith his account inclosed, amounting to forty-five pounds, which the\nwriter desired might be paid without delay. Before he had time to\nperuse the articles, he received a summons, in consequence of a bill of\nindictment for bigamy, found against him in Hicks’ Hall, by Sarah\nMuddy, widow; and, while he was revolving measures to avert these\nstorms, another billet arrived from a certain attorney, giving him to\nunderstand, that he had orders from Doctor Buffalo, the quack, to sue\nhim for the payment of several notes, unless he would take them up in\nthree days from the date of this letter.\n\nSuch a concurrence of sinister events made a deep impression upon the\nmind of our adventurer. All his fortitude was insufficient to bear him\nup against this torrent of misfortunes; his resources were all dried\nup, his invention failed, and his reflection began to take a new turn.\n“To what purpose,” said he to himself, “have I deserted the paths of\nintegrity and truth, and exhausted a fruitful imagination, in\ncontriving schemes to betray my fellow-creatures, if, instead of\nacquiring a splendid fortune, which was my aim, I have suffered such a\nseries of mortifications, and at last brought myself to the brink of\ninevitable destruction? By a virtuous exertion of those talents I\ninherit from nature and education, I might, long before this time, have\nrendered myself independent, and, perhaps, conspicuous in life. I might\nhave grown up like a young oak, which, being firmly rooted in its\nkindred soil, gradually raises up its lofty head, expands its leafy\narms, projects a noble shade, and towers the glory of the plain. I\nshould have paid the debt of gratitude to my benefactors, and made\ntheir hearts sing with joy for the happy effects of their benevolence.\nI should have been a bulwark to my friends, a shelter to my neighbours\nin distress. I should have run the race of honour, seen my fame\ndiffused like a sweet-smelling odour, and felt the ineffable pleasure\nof doing good. Whereas I am, after a vicissitude of disappointments,\ndangers, and fatigues, reduced to misery and shame, aggravated by a\nconscience loaded with treachery and guilt. I have abused the\nconfidence and generosity of my patron; I have defrauded his family,\nunder the mask of sincerity and attachment; I have taken the most cruel\nand base advantages of virtue in distress; I have seduced unsuspecting\ninnocence to ruin and despair; I have violated the most sacred trust\nreposed in me by my friend and benefactor; I have betrayed his love,\ntorn his noble heart asunder, by means of the most perfidious slander\nand false insinuations; and, finally, brought to an untimely grave the\nfairest pattern of human beauty and perfection. Shall the author of\nthese crimes pass with impunity? Shall he hope to prosper in the midst\nof such enormous guilt? It were an imputation upon Providence to\nsuppose it! Ah, no! I begin to feel myself overtaken by the eternal\njustice of Heaven! I totter on the edge of wretchedness and woe,\nwithout one friendly hand to save me from the terrible abyss!”\n\nThese reflections, which, perhaps, the misery of his fellow-creatures\nwould never have inspired, had he himself remained without the verge of\nmisfortune, were now produced from the sensation of his own calamities;\nand, for the first time, his cheeks were bedewed with the drops of\npenitence and sorrow. “Contraries,” saith Plato, “are productive of\neach other.” Reformation is oftentimes generated from unsuccessful\nvice; and our adventurer was, at this juncture, very well disposed to\nturn over a new leaf in consequence of those salutary suggestions;\nthough he was far from being cured beyond the possibility of a relapse.\nOn the contrary, all the faculties of his soul were so well adapted,\nand had been so long habituated to deceit, that, in order to extricate\nhimself from the evils that environed him, he would not, in all\nprobability, have scrupled to practise it upon his own father, had a\nconvenient opportunity occurred.\n\nBe that as it may, he certainly, after a tedious and fruitless exercise\nof his invention, resolved to effect a clandestine retreat from that\nconfederacy of enemies which he could not withstand, and once more join\nhis fortune to that of Renaldo, whom he proposed to serve, for the\nfuture, with fidelity and affection, thereby endeavouring to atone for\nthe treachery of his former conduct. Thus determined, he packed up his\nnecessaries in a portmanteau, attempted to amuse his creditors with\npromises of speedy payment, and, venturing to come forth in the dark,\ntook a place in the Canterbury stage-coach, after having converted his\nsuperfluities into ready money. These steps were not taken with such\nprivacy as to elude the vigilance of his adversaries; for, although he\nhad been cautious enough to transport himself and his baggage to the\ninn on Sunday evening, and never doubted that the vehicle, which set\nout at four o’clock on Monday morning, would convey him out of the\nreach of his creditors, before they could possibly obtain a writ for\nsecuring his person, they had actually taken such precautions as\nfrustrated all his finesse; and the coach being stopped in the borough\nof Southwark, Doctor Fathom was seized by virtue of a warrant obtained\non a criminal indictment, and was forthwith conducted to the prison of\nthe King’s Bench; yet, not before he had, by his pathetic\nremonstrances, excited the compassion, and even drawn tears from the\neyes of his fellow-passengers.\n\nHe no sooner recollected himself from the shock which must have been\noccasioned by this sinister incident, than he despatched a letter to\nhis brother-in-law, the counsellor, requesting an immediate conference,\nin which he promised to make such a proposal as would save him all the\nexpense of a lawsuit and trial, and, at the same time, effectually\nanswer all the purposes of both. He was accordingly favoured with a\nvisit from the lawyer, to whom, after the most solemn protestations of\nhis own innocence, he declared, that, finding himself unable to wage\nwar against such powerful antagonists, he had resolved even to abandon\nhis indubitable right, and retire into another country, in order to\nscreen himself from persecution, and remove all cause of disquiet from\nthe prosecutrix, when he was, unfortunately, prevented by the warrant\nwhich had been executed against him. He said he was still willing, for\nthe sake of his liberty, to sign a formal renunciation of his\npretensions to Mrs. Fathom and her fortune, provided the deeds could be\nexecuted, and the warrant withdrawn, before he should be detained by\nhis other creditors; and, lastly, he conjured the barrister to spare\nhimself the guilt and the charge of suborning evidence for the\ndestruction of an unhappy man, whose misfortune was his only fault.\n\nThe lawyer felt the force of his expostulations; and though he would by\nno means suppose him innocent of the charge of bigamy, yet, under the\npretext of humanity and commiseration, he undertook to persuade his\nsister to accept of a proper release, which, he observed, would not be\nbinding, if executed during the confinement of Fathom; he therefore\ntook his leave, in order to prepare the papers, withdraw the action,\nand take such other measures as would hinder the prisoner from giving\nhim the slip. Next day, he returned with an order to release our hero,\nwho, being formally discharged, was conducted by the lawyer to a tavern\nin the neighbourhood, where the releases were exchanged, and everything\nconcluded with amity and concord. This business being happily\ntransacted, Fathom stept into a hackney-coach, with his baggage, and\nwas followed by a bailiff, who told him, with great composure, that he\nwas again a prisoner, at the suit of Doctor Buffalo, and desired the\ncoachman to reconduct him to the lodging he had so lately discharged.\n\nFathom, whose fortitude had been hitherto of the pagan temper, was now\nfain to reinforce it with the philosophy of Christian resignation,\nthough he had not as yet arrived to such a pitch of self-denial as to\nforgive the counsellor, to whose double dealing he imputed this new\ncalamity. After having received the compliments of the jailer on his\nrecommitment, he took pen, ink, and paper, and composed an artful and\naffecting epistle to the empiric, imploring his mercy, flattering his\nweakness, and demonstrating the bad policy of cooping up an unhappy man\nin a jail, where he could never have an opportunity of doing justice to\nhis creditors; nor did he forget to declare his intention of retiring\ninto another country, where he might have some chance of earning a\nsubsistence, which he had so long toiled for to no purpose in England.\nThis last declaration he made in consequence of the jealous disposition\nof the quack, who he knew had long looked upon him in the odious light\nof an interloping rival. However, he reaped no benefit from this\nsupplication, which served only to gratify the pride of Buffalo, who\nproduced the extravagant encomiums which Fathom had bestowed upon him,\nas so many testimonials of his foe’s bearing witness to his virtue.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN\n\nFATHOM BEING SAFELY HOUSED, THE READER IS ENTERTAINED WITH A\nRETROSPECT.\n\nBut now it is high time to leave our adventurer to chew the cud of\nreflection and remorse in this solitary mansion, that we may trace\nRenaldo in the several steps he took to assert his right, and do\njustice to his family. Never man indulged a more melancholy train of\nideas than that which accompanied him in his journey to the Imperial\ncourt. For, notwithstanding the manifold reasons he had to expect a\nhappy issue to his aim, his imagination was incessantly infected with\nsomething that chilled his nerves and saddened his heart, recurring,\nwith quick succession, like the unwearied wave that beats upon the\nbleak, inhospitable Greenland shore. This, the reader will easily\nsuppose, was no other than the remembrance of the forlorn Monimia,\nwhose image appeared to his fancy in different attitudes, according to\nthe prevalence of the passions which raged in his bosom. Sometimes he\nviewed her in the light of apostasy, and then his soul was maddened\nwith indignation and despair. But these transitory blasts were not able\nto efface the impressions she had formerly made upon his heart;\nimpressions which he had so often and so long contemplated with\ninconceivable rapture. These pictures still remained, representing her\nfair as the most perfect idea of beauty, soft and tender as an angel of\nmercy and compassion, warmed with every virtue of the heart, and\nadorned with every accomplishment of human nature. Yet the alarming\ncontrast came still in the rear of this recollection; so that his soul\nwas by turns agitated by the tempests of horror, and overwhelmed by the\nfloods of grief.\n\nHe recalled the moment on which he first beheld her, with that pleasing\nregret which attends the memory of a dear deceased friend. Then he\nbitterly cursed it, as the source of all his misfortunes and\naffliction. He thanked Heaven for having blessed him with a friend to\ndetect her perfidy and ingratitude; and then ardently wished he had\nstill continued under the influence of her delusion. In a word, the\nloneliness of his situation aggravated every horror of his reflection;\nfor, as he found himself without company, his imagination was never\nsolicited, or his attention diverted from these subjects of woe; and he\ntravelled to Brussels in a reverie, fraught with such torments as must\nhave entirely wrecked his reason, had not Providence interposed in his\nbehalf. He was, by his postillion, conducted to one of the best inns of\nthe place, where he understood the cloth was already laid for supper;\nand as the ordinary is open to strangers in all these houses of\nentertainment, he introduced himself into the company, with a view to\nalleviate, in some measure, his sorrow and chagrin, by the conversation\nof his fellow-guests. Yet he was so ill prepared to obtain the relief\nwhich he courted, that he entered the apartment, and sat down to table,\nwithout distinguishing either the number or countenances of those who\nwere present, though he himself did not long remain so unregarded. His\nmien and deportment produced a prepossession in his favour; and the air\nof affliction, so remarkable in his visage, did not fail to attract\ntheir sympathy and observation.\n\nAmong the rest, was an Irish officer in the Austrian service, who\nhaving eyed Renaldo attentively, “Sir,” said he, rising, “if my eyes\nand memory do not deceive me, you are the Count de Melvil, with whom I\nhad the honour to serve upon the Rhine during the last war.” The youth,\nhearing his own name mentioned, lifted up his eyes, and at once\nrecognising the other to be a gentleman who had been a captain in his\nfather’s regiment, ran forwards, and embraced him with great affection.\n\nThis was, in divers respects, a fortunate rencontre for young Melvil;\nas the officer was not only perfectly well acquainted with the\nsituation of the Count’s family, but also resolved, in a few days, to\nset out for Vienna, whither he promised to accompany Renaldo, as soon\nas he understood his route lay the same way. Before the day fixed for\ntheir departure arrived, this gentleman found means to insinuate\nhimself so far into the confidence of the Count, as to learn the cause\nof that distress which he had observed in his features at their first\nmeeting; and being a gentleman of uncommon vivacity, as well as\nsincerely attached to the family of Melvil, to which he had owed his\npromotion, he exerted all his good-humour and good sense in amusing the\nfancy, and reasoning down the mortification of the afflicted Hungarian.\nHe in particular endeavoured to wean his attention from the lost\nMonimia, by engaging it upon his domestic affairs, and upon the wrongs\nof his mother and sister, who, he gave him to understand, were\nlanguishing under the tyranny of his father-in-law.\n\nThis was a note that effectually roused him from the lethargy of his\nsorrow; and the desire of taking vengeance on the oppressor, who had\nruined his fortune, and made his nearest relations miserable, so\nentirely engrossed his thoughts, as to leave no room for other\nconsiderations. During their journey to Austria, Major Farrel, (that\nwas the name of his fellow-traveller,) informed him of many\ncircumstances touching his father’s house, to which himself was an\nutter stranger.\n\n“The conduct of your mother,” said he, “in marrying Count Trebasi, was\nnot at all agreeable either to the friends of the Count de Melvil, or\nto her own relations, who knew her second husband to be a man of a\nviolent temper, and rapacious disposition, which the nature of his\neducation and employment had served rather to inflame than allay; for\nyou well know he was a partisan during the whole course of the late\nwar. They were, moreover, equally surprised and chagrined, when they\nfound she took no step to prevent his seizing upon that inheritance\nwhich of right belonged to you, and which, by the laws of Hungary, is\nunalienable from the heir of blood. Nevertheless, they are now fully\nconvinced, that she hath more than sufficiently atoned for her\nindiscretion, by the barbarity of her husband, who hath not only\nsecluded her from all communication with her friends and acquaintance,\nbut even confined her to the west tower of your father’s house, where\nshe is said to be kept close prisoner, and subjected to all sorts of\ninconvenience and mortification. This severity she is believed to have\nincurred in consequence of having expostulated to him upon his unjust\nbehaviour to you and Mademoiselle, whom he hath actually shut up in\nsome convent in Vienna, which your relations have not as yet been able\nto discover. But the memory of your noble father is so dear to all\nthose who were favoured with his friendship, and the sufferings of the\nCountess and Mademoiselle have raised such a spirit of resentment\nagainst her cruel jailor, that nothing is wanted but your presence to\nbegin the prosecution, and give a sanction to the measures of your\nfriends, which will in a little time restore your family to the\nfruition of its rights and fortune. For my own part, my dear Count, I\nconsider myself as one wholly indebted to your house for the rank and\nexpectation I now enjoy; and my finances, interest, and person, such as\nthey are, I dedicate to your service.”\n\nRenaldo was not slow in making his acknowledgments to this generous\nHibernian, whom he informed of his scheme, recounting to him his\nuncommon transaction with the benevolent Jew, and communicating the\nletters of recommendation he had received by his means to some of the\nfirst noblemen at the Imperial court. Meanwhile, he burned with\nimpatience to chastise Count Trebasi for his perfidious conduct to the\nwidow and the fatherless, and would have taken the road to Presburg,\nwithout touching at Vienna, in order to call him to a severe account,\nhad not he been strenuously opposed by Major Farrel, who represented\nthe imprudence of taking such a step before he had secured a proper\nprotection from the consequences with which it might be attended.\n\n“It is not,” said he, “your own life and fortune only which depend upon\nyour behaviour in this emergency, but also the quiet and happiness of\nthose who are most dear to your affection. Not you alone, but likewise\nyour mother and sister, would infallibly suffer by your temerity and\nprecipitation. First of all, deliver your credentials at court, and let\nus join our endeavours to raise an interest strong enough to\ncounterbalance that of Trebasi. If we succeed, there will be no\nnecessity for having recourse to personal measures. He will be\ncompelled to yield up your inheritance which he unjustly detains, and\nto restore your sister to your arms; and if he afterwards refuses to do\njustice to the Countess, you will always have it in your power to\nevince yourself the son of the brave Count de Melvil.”\n\nThese just and salutary representations had a due effect upon Renaldo,\nwho no sooner arrived at the capital of Austria, than he waited upon a\ncertain prince of distinction, to whose patronage he was commended; and\nfrom whom he met with a very cordial reception, not only on account of\nhis credentials, but also for the sake of his father, who was well\nknown to his highness. He heard his complaints with great patience and\naffability, assured him of his assistance and protection, and even\nundertook to introduce him to the empress-queen, who would not suffer\nthe weakest of her subjects to be oppressed, much less disregard the\ncause of an injured young nobleman, who, by his own services, and those\nof his family, was peculiarly entitled to her favour.\n\nNor was he the only person whose countenance and patronage Melvil\nsolicited upon this occasion; he visited all the friends of his father,\nand all his mother’s relations, who were easily interested in his\nbehalf; while Major Farrel contributed all his efforts in strengthening\nthe association. So that a lawsuit was immediately commenced against\nCount Trebasi, who on his side was not idle, but prepared with\nincredible industry for the assault, resolving to maintain with his\nwhole power the acquisition he had made.\n\nThe laws of Hungary, like those of some other countries I could name,\nafford so many subterfuges for the purposes of perfidy and fraud, that\nit is no wonder our youth began to complain of the slow progress of his\naffair; especially as he glowed with the most eager desire of\nredressing the grievances of his parent and sister, whose sufferings he\ndid not doubt were doubled since the institution of his process against\ntheir tormentor. He imparted his sentiments on this head to his friend;\nand, as his apprehensions every moment increased, plainly told him he\ncould no longer live without making some effort to see those with whom\nhe was so nearly connected in point of blood and affection. He\ntherefore resolved to repair immediately to Presburg; and, according to\nthe intelligence he should procure, essay to see and converse with his\nmother, though at the hazard of his life.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT\n\nRENALDO ABRIDGES THE PROCEEDINGS AT LAW, AND APPROVES HIMSELF THE SON\nOF HIS FATHER.\n\nThe Major, finding him determined, insisted upon attending him in this\nexpedition, and they set out together for Presburg, where they\nprivately arrived in the dark, resolving to keep themselves concealed\nat the house of a friend, until they should have formed some plan for\ntheir future operations. Here they were informed that Count Trebasi’s\ncastle was altogether inaccessible; that all the servants who were\nsupposed to have the least veneration or compassion for the Countess\nwere dismissed; and that, since Renaldo was known to be in Germany, the\nvigilance and caution of that cruel husband was redoubled to such a\ndegree, that nobody knew whether his unfortunate lady was actually\nalive or dead.\n\nFarrel perceiving Melvil exceedingly affected with this intimation, and\nhearing him declare that he would never quit Presburg until he should\nhave entered the house, and removed his doubts on that interesting\nsubject, not only argued with great vehemence against such an attempt,\nas equally dangerous and indiscreet, but solemnly swore he would\nprevent his purpose, by discovering his design to the family, unless he\nwould promise to listen to a more moderate and feasible expedient. He\nthen proposed that he himself should appear in the equipage of one of\nthe travelling Savoyards who stroll about Europe, amusing ignorant\npeople with the effects of a magic lanthorn, and in that disguise\nendeavour to obtain admittance from the servants of Trebasi, among whom\nhe might make such inquiries as would deliver Melvil from his present\nuneasy suspense.\n\nThis proposal was embraced, though reluctantly, by Renaldo, who was\nunwilling to expose his friend to the least danger or disgrace; and the\nMajor being next day provided with the habit and implements of his new\nprofession, together with a ragged attendant who preceded him,\nextorting music from a paltry viol, approached the castle gate, and\nproclaimed his show so naturally in a yell, partaking of the scream of\nSavoy and the howl of Ireland, that one would have imagined he had been\nconductor to Madam Catherina from his cradle. So far his stratagem\nsucceeded; he had not long stood in waiting before he was invited into\nthe court-yard, where the servants formed a ring, and danced to the\nefforts of his companion’s skill; then he was conducted into the\nbuttery, where he exhibited his figures on the wall, and his princess\non the floor; and while they regaled him in this manner with scraps and\nsour wine, he took occasion to inquire about the old lady and her\ndaughter, before whom he said he had performed in his last\nperegrination. Though this question was asked with all that air of\nsimplicity which is peculiar to these people, one of the domestics took\nthe alarm, being infected with the suspicions of his master, and\nplainly taxed the Major with being a spy, threatening at the same time\nthat he should be stripped and searched.\n\nThis would have been a very dangerous experiment for the Hibernian, who\nhad actually in his pocket a letter to the Countess from her son, which\nhe hoped fortune might have furnished him with an opportunity to\ndeliver. When he therefore found himself in this dilemma, he was not at\nall easy in his own mind. However, instead of protesting his innocence\nin an humble and beseeching strain, in order to acquit himself of the\ncharge, he resolved to elude the suspicion by provoking the wrath of\nhis accuser, and, putting on the air of vulgar integrity affronted,\nbegan to reproach the servant in very insolent terms for his unfair\nsupposition, and undressed himself in a moment to the skin, threw his\ntattered garments in the face of his adversary, telling him he would\nfind nothing there which he would not be very glad to part with; at the\nsame time raising his voice, he, in the gibberish of the clan he\nrepresented, scolded and cursed with great fluency, so that the whole\nhouse resounded with the noise. The valet’s jealousy, like a smaller\nfire, was in a trice swallowed up in the greater flame of his rage\nenkindled by this abrupt address. In consequence of which, Farrel was\nkicked out at the gate, naked as he was to the waist, after his\nlanthorn had been broke to pieces on his head; and there he was joined\nby his domestic, who had not been able to recover his apparel and\neffect a retreat, without incurring marks of the same sort of\ndistinction.\n\nThe Major, considering the risk he must have run in being detected,\nthought himself cheaply quit for this moderate discipline, though he\nwas really concerned for his friend Renaldo, who, understanding the\nparticulars of the adventure, determined, as the last effort, to ride\nround the castle in the open day, on pretence of taking the air, when,\nperadventure, the Countess would see him from the place of her\nconfinement, and favour him with some mark or token of her being alive.\n\nThough his companion did not much relish this plan, which he foresaw\nwould expose him to the insults of Trebasi, yet, as he could not\ncontrive a better, he acquiesced in Renaldo’s invention, with the\nproviso that he would defer the execution of it until his father-in-law\nshould be absent in the chase, which was a diversion he every day\nenjoyed.\n\nAccordingly they set a proper watch, and lay concealed until they were\ninformed of Trebasi’s having gone forth; when they mounted their\nhorses, and rode into the neighbourhood of the castle. Having made a\nsmall excursion in the adjoining fields, they drew nearer the walls,\nand at an easy pace had twice circled them, when Farrel descried, at\nthe top of a tower, a white handkerchief waved by a woman’s hand\nthrough the iron bars that secured the window. This signal being\npointed out to Renaldo, his heart began to throb with great violence;\nhe made a respectful obeisance towards the part in which it appeared,\nand perceiving the hand beckoning him to approach, advanced to the very\nbuttress of the turret; upon which, seeing something drop, he alighted\nwith great expedition, and took up a picture of his father in\nminiature, the features of which he no sooner distinguished, than the\ntears ran down his cheeks; he pressed the little image to his lips with\nthe most filial fervour; then conveying it to his bosom, looked up to\nthe hand, which waved in such a manner as gave him to understand it was\nhigh time to retire. Being by this time highly persuaded that his kind\nmonitor was no other than the Countess herself, he pointed to his\nheart, in token of his filial affection, and laying his hand on his\nsword, to denote his resolution of doing her justice, he took his leave\nwith another profound bow, and suffered himself to be reconducted to\nhis lodging.\n\nEvery circumstance of this transaction was observed by the servants of\nCount Trebasi, who immediately despatched a messenger to their lord,\nwith an account of what had happened. Alarmed at this information, from\nwhich he immediately concluded that the stranger was young Melvil, he\nforthwith quitted the chase, and returning to the castle by a private\npostern, ordered his horse to be kept ready saddled, in hope that his\nson-in-law would repeat the visit to his mother. This precaution would\nhave been to no purpose, had Renaldo followed the advice of Farrel, who\nrepresented the danger of returning to a place where the alarm was\nundoubtedly given by his first appearance; and exhorted him to return\nto Vienna for the prosecution of his suit, now that he was satisfied of\nhis mother’s being alive. In order to strengthen this admonition, he\nbade him recollect the signal for withdrawing, which was doubtless the\neffect of maternal concern, inspired by the knowledge of the Count’s\nvigilance and vindictive disposition.\n\nNotwithstanding these suggestions, Melvil persisted in his resolution\nof appearing once more below the tower, on the supposition that his\nmother, in expectation of his return, had prepared a billet for his\nacceptance, from which he might obtain important intelligence. The\nMajor, seeing him lend a deaf ear to his remonstrances, was contented\nto attend him in his second expedition, which he pressed him to\nundertake that same afternoon, as Trebasi had taken care to circulate a\nreport of his having gone to dine at the seat of a nobleman in the\nneighbourhood. Our knight-errant and his squire, deceived by this\nfinesse, presented themselves again under the prison of the Countess,\nwho no sooner beheld her son return, than she earnestly entreated him\nto be gone, by the same sign which she had before used; and he, taking\nit for granted that she was debarred the use of pen, ink, and paper,\nand that she had nothing more to expect, consented to retire, and had\nalready moved to some distance from the house, when, in crossing a\nsmall plantation that belonged to the castle, they were met by Count\nTrebasi and another person on horseback.\n\nAt sight of this apparition, the blood mounted into Renaldo’s cheeks,\nand his eyes began to lighten with eagerness and indignation; which was\nnot at all diminished by the ferocious address of the Count, who\nadvancing to Melvil, with a menacing air. “Before you proceed,” said\nhe, “I must know with what view you have been twice to-day patroling\nround my enclosures, and reconnoitring the different avenues of my\nhouse. You likewise carry on a clandestine correspondence with some\nperson in the family, of which my honour obliges me to demand an\nexplanation.”\n\n“Had your actions been always regulated by the dictates of honour,”\nreplied Renaldo, “I should never have been questioned for riding round\nthat castle, which you know is my rightful inheritance; or excluded\nfrom the sight of a parent who suffers under your tyranny and\noppression. It is my part, therefore, to expostulate; and, since\nfortune hath favoured me with an opportunity of revenging our wrongs in\nperson, we shall not part until you have learned that the family of the\nCount de Melvil is not to be injured with impunity. Here is no\nadvantage on either side, in point of arms or number; you are better\nmounted than I am, and shall have the choice of the ground on which our\ndifference ought to be brought to a speedy determination.”\n\nTrebasi, whose courage was not of the sentimental kind, but purely\nowing to his natural insensibility of danger, instead of concerting\nmeasures coolly for the engagement, or making any verbal reply to this\ndefiance, drew a pistol, without the least hesitation, and fired it at\nthe face of Renaldo, part of whose left eyebrow was carried off by the\nball. Melvil was not slow in returning the compliment, which, as it was\ndeliberate, proved the more decisive. For the shot entering the Count’s\nright breast, made its way to the backbone with such a shock, as struck\nhim to the ground; upon which the other alighted, in order to improve\nthe advantage he had gained.\n\nDuring this transaction, Farrel had well-nigh lost his life by the\nsavage behaviour of Trebasi’s attendant, who had been a hussar officer,\nand who, thinking it was his duty to imitate the example of his patron\non this occasion, discharged a pistol at the Major, before he had the\nleast intimation of his design. The Hibernian’s horse being a common\nhireling, and unaccustomed to stand fire, no sooner saw the flash of\nTrebasi’s pistol, than, starting aside, he happened to plunge into a\nhole, and was overturned at the very instant when the hussar’s piece\nwent off, so that no damage ensued to his rider, who, pitching on his\nfeet, flew with great nimbleness to his adversary, then, laying hold on\none leg, dismounted him in a twinkling, and, seizing his throat as he\nlay, would have soon despatched him without the use of firearms, had he\nnot been prevented by his friend Renaldo, who desired him to desist,\nobserving that his vengeance was already satisfied, as the Count seemed\nto be in the agonies of death. The Major was loth to quit his prey, as\nhe thought his aggressor had acted in a treacherous manner; but\nrecollecting that there was no time to lose, because, in all\nprobability, the firing had alarmed the castle, he took his leave of\nthe vanquished hussar, with a couple of hearty kicks, and, mounting his\nhorse, followed Melvil to the house of a gentleman in the\nneighbourhood, who was kinsman to the Countess, and very well disposed\nto grant him a secure retreat, until the troublesome consequences of\nthis rencontre should be overblown.\n\nTrebasi, though to the young gentleman he seemed speechless and\ninsensible, had neither lost the use of his reason nor of his tongue,\nbut affected that extremity, in order to avoid any further conversation\nwith the victor. He was one of those people who never think of death\nuntil he knocks at the door, and then earnestly entreat him to excuse\nthem for the present, and be so good as to call another time. The Count\nhad so often escaped unhurt, in the course of his campaigns, that he\nlooked upon himself as invulnerable, and set all danger at defiance.\nThough he had hitherto taken no care of the concerns of his soul, he\nhad a large fund of superstition at bottom; and, when the surgeon, who\nexamined his wound, declared it was mortal, all the terrors of futurity\ntook hold on his imagination, all the misdemeanours of his life\npresented themselves in aggravated colours to his recollection.\n\nHe implored the spiritual assistance of a good priest in the\nneighbourhood, who, in the discharge of his own conscience, gave him to\nunderstand that he had little mercy to expect, unless he would, as much\nas lay in his power, redress the injuries he had done to his\nfellow-creatures. As nothing lay heavier upon his soul than the cruelty\nand fraud he had practised upon the family of Count Melvil, he\nearnestly besought this charitable clergyman to mediate his pardon with\nthe Countess, and at the same time desired to see Renaldo before his\ndeath, that he might put him in possession of his paternal estate, and\nsolicit his forgiveness for the offence he had given.\n\nHis lady, far from waiting for the priest’s intercession, no sooner\nunderstood the lamentable situation of her husband, and found herself\nat liberty, than she hastened to his apartment, expressed the utmost\nconcern for his misfortune, and tended him with truly conjugal\ntenderness and fidelity. Her son gladly obeyed the summons, and was\nreceived with great civility and satisfaction by his father-in-law,\nwho, in presence of the judge and divers gentlemen assembled for that\npurpose, renounced all right and title to the fortune he had so\nunjustly usurped; disclosed the name of the convent to which\nMademoiselle de Melvil had been conveyed, dismissed all the agents of\nhis iniquity, and being reconciled to his son-in-law, began to prepare\nhimself in tranquillity for his latter end.\n\nThe Countess was overwhelmed with an excess of joy, while she embraced\nher long-lost son, who had proved himself so worthy of his father. Yet\nthis joy was embittered, by reflecting that she was made a widow by the\nhands of that darling son. For, though she knew his honour demanded the\nsacrifice, she could not lay aside that regard and veneration which is\nattached to the name of husband; and therefore resolved to retire into\na monastery, where she could spend the remainder of her life in\ndevotion, without being exposed to any intercourse which might\ninterfere with the delicacy of her sentiments on that subject.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTY-NINE\n\nHE IS THE MESSENGER OF HAPPINESS TO HIS SISTER, WHO REMOVES THE FILM\nWHICH HAD LONG OBSTRUCTED HIS PENETRATION, WITH REGARD TO COUNT FATHOM.\n\nAs the most endearing affection had always subsisted between Renaldo\nand his sister, he would not one moment deny himself the pleasure of\nflying to her embrace, and of being the glad messenger of her\ndeliverance. Soon, therefore, as he understood the place of her\nretreat, and had obtained a proper order to the abbess, signed by Count\nTrebasi, he set out post for Vienna, still accompanied by his faithful\nHibernian, and, arriving at the convent, found the abbess and the whole\nhouse so engrossed in making preparations for the ceremony of giving\nthe veil next day to a young woman who had fulfilled the term of her\nprobation, that he could not possibly see his sister with that leisure\nand satisfaction which he had flattered himself with enjoying at this\nmeeting; and therefore he was fain to bridle his impatience for two\ndays, and keep his credentials until the hurry should be over, that\nMademoiselle might have no intimation of her good fortune, except from\nhis own mouth.\n\nIn order to fill up this tedious interval, he visited his friends at\ncourt, who were rejoiced to hear the happy issue of his excursion to\nPresburg; the prince, who was his particular patron, desired he would\nmake himself perfectly easy with regard to the death of Count Trebasi,\nfor he would take care to represent him in such a light to the\nempress-queen, as would screen him from any danger or prosecution on\nthat account. His highness, moreover, appointed the following day for\nperforming the promise he had made of presenting him to that august\nprincess, and in the meantime prepossessed her so much in his favour,\nthat when he approached her presence, and was announced by his noble\nintroductor, she eyed him with a look of peculiar complacency, saying,\n“I am glad to see you returned to my dominions. Your father was a\ngallant officer, who served our house with equal courage and fidelity;\nand as I understand you tread in his footsteps, you may depend upon my\nfavour and protection.”\n\nHe was so much overwhelmed with this gracious reception, that, while he\nbowed in silence, the drops of gratitude trickled from his eyes; and\nher imperial majesty was so well pleased with this manifestation of his\nheart, that she immediately gave directions for promoting him to the\ncommand of a troop of horse. Thus fortune seemed willing, and indeed\neager to discharge the debt she owed him for the different calamities\nhe had undergone. And as he looked upon the generous Hebrew to be the\nsole source of his success, he did not fail to make him acquainted with\nthe happy effects of his recommendation and friendship, and to express,\nin the warmest terms, the deep sense he had of his uncommon\nbenevolence, which, by the bye, was still greater, with regard to\nRenaldo, than the reader as yet imagines; for he not only furnished him\nwith money for his present occasions, but also gave him an unlimited\ncredit on a banker in Vienna, to whom one of his letters was directed.\n\nThe ceremony of the nun’s admission being now performed, and the\nconvent restored to its former quiet, Melvil hastened thither on the\nwings of brotherly affection, and presented his letter to the abbess,\nwho having perused the contents, by which she learned that the family\ndisquiets of Count Trebasi no longer subsisted, and that the bearer was\nthe brother of Mademoiselle, she received him with great politeness,\ncongratulated him on this happy event, and, begging he would excuse her\nstaying with him in the parlour, on pretence of business, withdrew,\nsaying, she would immediately send in a young lady who would console\nhim for her absence. In a few minutes he was joined by his sister, who,\nexpecting nothing less than to see Renaldo, no sooner distinguished his\nfeatures, than she shrieked aloud with surprise, and would have sunk\nupon the floor, had not he supported her in his embrace.\n\nSuch a sudden apparition of her brother at any time, or in any place,\nafter their long separation, would have strongly affected this sensible\nyoung lady; but to find him so abruptly in a place where she thought\nherself buried from the knowledge of all her relations, occasioned such\ncommotions in her spirits as had well-nigh endangered her reason. For\nit was not till after a considerable pause, that she could talk to him\nwith connexion or coherence. However, as those transports subsided,\nthey entered into a more deliberate and agreeable conversation; in the\ncourse of which, he gradually informed her of what had passed at the\ncastle; and inexpressible was the pleasure she felt in learning that\nher mother was released from captivity, herself restored to freedom,\nand her brother to the possession of his inheritance, by the only means\nto which she had always prayed these blessings might be owing.\n\nAs she had been treated with uncommon humanity by the abbess, she would\nnot consent to leave the convent until he should be ready to set out\nfor Presburg; so that they dined together with that good lady, and\npassed the afternoon in that mutual communication with which a brother\nand sister may be supposed to entertain themselves on such an occasion.\nShe gave him a detail of the insults and mortifications she had\nsuffered from the brutality of her father-in-law, and told him, that\nher confinement in this monastery was owing to Trebasi having\nintercepted a letter to her from Renaldo, signifying his intention to\nreturn to the empire, in order to assert his own right, and redress his\ngrievances. Then turning the discourse upon the incidents of his\nperegrinations, she in a particular manner inquired about that\nexquisite beauty who had been the innocent source of all his\ndistresses, and upon whose perfections he had often, in his letters to\nhis sister, expatiated with indications of rapture and delight.\n\nThis inquiry in a moment blew up that scorching flame which had been\nwell-nigh stifled by other necessary avocations. His eyes gleamed, his\ncheeks glowed and grew pale alternately, and his whole frame underwent\nan immediate agitation; which being perceived by Mademoiselle, she\nconcluded that some new calamity was annexed to the name of Monimia,\nand, dreading to rip up a wound which she saw was so ineffectually\nclosed, she for the present suppressed her curiosity and concern, and\nindustriously endeavoured to introduce some less affecting subject of\nconversation. He saw her aim, approved of her discretion, and, joining\nher endeavours, expressed his surprise at her having omitted to signify\nthe least remembrance of her old favourite, Fathom, whom he had left in\nEngland. He had no sooner pronounced this name, than she suffered some\nconfusion in her turn; from which, however, recollecting herself,\n“Brother,” said she, “you must endeavour to forget that wretch, who is\naltogether unworthy of retaining the smallest share of your regard.”\n\nAstonished, and indeed angry, at this expression, which he considered\nas the effect of malicious misrepresentation, he gently chid her for\nher credulity in believing the envious aspersion of some person, who\nrepined at the superior virtue of Fathom, whom he affirmed to be an\nhonour to the human species.\n\n“Nothing is more easy,” replied the young lady, “than to impose upon a\nperson, who, being himself unconscious of guile, suspects no deceit.\nYou have been a dupe, dear brother, not to the finesse of Fathom, but\nto the sincerity of your own heart. For my own part, I assume no honour\nto my own penetration in having comprehended the villany of that\nimpostor, which was discovered, in more than one instance, by accidents\nI could not possibly foresee.\n\n“You must know, that Teresa, who attended me from my childhood, and in\nwhose honesty I reposed such confidence, having disobliged some of the\ninferior servants, was so narrowly watched in all her transactions, as\nto be at last detected in the very act of conveying a piece of plate,\nwhich was actually found concealed among her clothes.\n\n“You may guess how much I was astonished when I understood this\ncircumstance. I could not trust to the evidence of my own senses, and\nshould have still believed her innocent, in spite of ocular\ndemonstration, had not she, in the terrors of being tried for felony,\npromised to make a very material discovery to the Countess, provided\nshe would take such measures as would save her life.\n\n“This request being complied with, she, in my hearing, opened up such\nan amazing scene of iniquity, baseness, and ingratitude, which had been\nacted by her and Fathom, in order to defraud the family to which they\nwere so much indebted, that I could not have believed the human mind\ncapable of such degeneracy, or that traitor endowed with such\npernicious cunning and dissimulation, had not her tale been congruous,\nconsistent, and distinct, and fraught with circumstances that left no\nroom to doubt the least article of her confession; on consideration of\nwhich she was permitted to go into voluntary exile.”\n\nShe then explained their combination in all the particulars, as we have\nalready recounted them in their proper place, and finally observed,\nthat the opinion she had hence conceived of Fathom’s character, was\nconfirmed by what she had since learned of his perfidious conduct\ntowards that very nun who had lately taken the veil.\n\nPerceiving her brother struck dumb with astonishment, and gaping with\nthe most eager attention, she proceeded to relate the incidents of his\ndouble intrigue with the jeweller’s wife and daughter, as they were\ncommunicated to her by the nun, who was no other than the individual\nWilhelmina. After those rivals had been forsaken by their gallant,\ntheir mutual animosities and chagrin served to whet the attention and\ninvention of each; so that in a little time the whole mystery stood\ndisclosed to both. The mother had discovered the daughter’s\ncorrespondence with Fathom, as we have formerly observed, by means of\nthat unfortunate letter which he unwittingly committed to the charge of\nthe old beldame; and, as soon as she understood he was without the\nreach of all solicitation or prosecution, imparted this billet to her\nhusband, whose fury was so ungovernable, that he had almost sacrificed\nWilhelmina with his own hands, especially when, terrified by his\nthreats and imprecations, she owned that she had bestowed the chain on\nthis perfidious lover. However, this dreadful purpose was prevented,\npartly by the interposition of his wife, whose aim was not the death\nbut immurement of his daughter, and partly by the tears and\nsupplication of the young gentlewoman herself, who protested, that,\nalthough the ceremony of the church had not been performed, she was\ncontracted to Fathom by the most solemn vows, to witness which he\ninvoked all the saints in heaven.\n\nThe jeweller, upon cooler consideration, was unwilling to lose the last\nspark of hope that glittered among the ruins of his despair, and\nresisted all the importunities of his wife, who pressed him to consult\nthe welfare of his daughter’s soul, in the fond expectation of finding\nsome expedient to lure back the chain and its possessor. In the\nmeantime Wilhelmina was daily and hourly exposed to the mortifying\nanimadversions of her mamma, who, with all the insolence of virtue,\nincessantly upbraided her with the backslidings of her vicious life,\nand exhorted her to reformation and repentance. This continual triumph\nlasted for many months, till at length, a quarrel happening between the\nmother and the gossip at whose house she used to give the rendezvous to\nher admirers, that incensed confidante, in the precipitation of her\nanger, promulgated the history of those secret meetings; and, among the\nrest, her interviews with Fathom were brought to light.\n\nThe first people who hear news of this sort are generally those to whom\nthey are most unwelcome. The German was soon apprised of his wife’s\nfrailty, and considered the two females of his house as a couple of\ndevils incarnate, sent from hell to exercise his patience. Yet, in the\nmidst of his displeasure, he found matter of consolation, in being\nfurnished with a sufficient reason for parting with his helpmate, who\nhad for many years kept his family in disquiet. He therefore, without\nhazarding a personal conference, sent proposals to her by a friend,\nwhich she did not think proper to reject; and seeing himself restored\nto the dominion of his own house, exerted his sway so tyrannically,\nthat Wilhelmina became weary of her life, and had recourse to the\ncomforts of religion, of which she soon became enamoured, and begged\nher father’s permission to dedicate the rest of her life to the duties\nof devotion. She was accordingly received in this convent, the\nregulations of which were so much to her liking, that she performed the\ntask of probation with pleasure, and voluntarily excluded herself from\nthe vanities of this life. It was here she had contracted an\nacquaintance with Mademoiselle de Melvil, to whom she communicated her\ncomplaints of Fathom, on the supposition that he was related to the\nCount, as he himself had often declared.\n\nWhile the young lady rehearsed the particulars of this detail, Renaldo\nsustained a strange vicissitude of different passions. Surprise,\nsorrow, fear, hope, and indignation raised a most tumultuous conflict\nin his bosom. Monimia rushed upon his imagination in the character of\ninnocence betrayed by the insinuations of treachery. He with horror\nviewed her at the mercy of a villain, who had broken all the ties of\ngratitude and honour.\n\nAffrighted at the prospect, he started from his seat, exclaiming, in\nthe most unconnected strain of distraction and despair, “Have I then\nnourished a serpent in my bosom! Have I listened to the voice of a\ntraitor, who hath murdered my peace! who hath torn my heart-strings\nasunder, and perhaps ruined the pattern of all earthly perfection. It\ncannot be. Heaven would not suffer such infernal artifice to take\neffect. The thunder would be levelled against the head of the accursed\nprojector.”\n\nFrom this transport, compared with his agitation when he mentioned\nMonimia, his sister judged that Fathom had been the occasion of a\nbreach between the two lovers; and this conjecture being confirmed by\nthe disjointed answers he made to her interrogations upon the affair,\nshe endeavoured to calm his apprehensions, by representing that he\nwould soon have an opportunity of returning to England, where the\nmisunderstanding might be easily cleared up; and that, in the meantime,\nhe had nothing to fear on account of the person of his mistress, in a\ncountry where individuals were so well protected by the laws and\nconstitution of the realm. At length he suffered himself to be\nflattered with the fond hope of seeing Monimia’s character triumph in\nthe inquiry, of retrieving that lost jewel, and of renewing that\nravishing intercourse and exalted expectation which had been so cruelly\ncut off. He now wished to find Fathom as black as he had been\nexhibited, that Monimia’s apostasy might be numbered among the\nmisrepresentations of his treachery and fraud.\n\nHis love, which was alike generous and ardent, espoused the cause, and\nhe no longer doubted her constancy and virtue. But when he reflected\nhow her tender heart must have been wrung with anguish at his\nunkindness and cruelty, in leaving her destitute in a foreign land; how\nher sensibility must have been tortured in finding herself altogether\ndependent upon a ruffian, who certainly harboured the most baleful\ndesigns upon her honour; how her life must be endangered both by his\nbarbarity and her own despair—I say, when he reflected on these\ncircumstances, he shuddered with horror and dismay; and that very night\ndespatched a letter to his friend the Jew, entreating him, in the most\npressing manner, to employ all his intelligence in learning the\nsituation of the fair orphan, that she might be protected from the\nvillany of Fathom, until his return to England.\n\nCHAPTER SIXTY\n\nHE RECOMPENSES THE ATTACHMENT OF HIS FRIEND; AND RECEIVES A LETTER THAT\nREDUCES HIM TO THE VERGE OF DEATH AND DISTRACTION.\n\nThis step being taken, his mind in some measure retrieved its former\ntranquillity. He soothed himself with the prospect of a happy\nreconciliation with the divine Monimia, and his fancy was decoyed from\nevery disagreeable presage by the entertaining conversation of his\nsister, with whom in two days he set out for Presburg, attended by his\nfriend the Major, who had never quitted him since their meeting at\nBrussels. Here they found Count Trebasi entirely rid of the fever which\nhad been occasioned by his wound, and in a fair way of doing well; a\ncircumstance that afforded unspeakable pleasure to Melvil, whose manner\nof thinking was such, as would have made him unhappy, could he have\ncharged himself with the death of his mother’s husband, howsoever\ncriminal he might have been.\n\nThe Count’s ferocity did not return with his health. His eyes were\nopened by the danger he had incurred, and his sentiments turned in a\nnew channel. He heartily asked pardon of Mademoiselle for the rigorous\nusage she had suffered from the violence of his temper; thanked Renaldo\nfor the seasonable lesson he had administered to him; and not only\ninsisted upon being removed from the castle to a house of his own in\nPresburg, but proffered to make immediate restitution of all the rents\nwhich he had unjustly converted to his own use.\n\nThese things being settled in the most amicable manner, to the entire\nsatisfaction of the parties concerned, as well as of the neighbouring\nnoblesse, among whom the house of Melvil was in universal esteem,\nRenaldo resolved to solicit leave at the Imperial court to return to\nEngland, in order to investigate that affair of Monimia, which was more\ninteresting than all the points he had hitherto adjusted. But, before\nhe quitted Presburg, his friend Farrel taking him aside one day,\n“Count,” said he, “will you give me leave to ask, if, by my zeal and\nattachment for you, I have had the good fortune to acquire your\nesteem?” “To doubt that esteem,” replied Renaldo, “were to suspect my\ngratitude and honour, of which I must be utterly destitute before I\nlose the sense of those obligations I owe to your gallantry and\nfriendship—obligations which I long for a proper occasion to repay.”\n\n“Well then,” resumed the Major, “I will deal with you like a downright\nSwiss, and point out a method by which you may shift the load of\nobligation from your own shoulders to mine. You know my birth, rank,\nand expectations in the service; but perhaps you do not know, that, as\nmy expense has always unavoidably exceeded my income, I find myself a\nlittle out at elbows in my circumstances, and want to piece them up by\nmatrimony. Of those ladies with whom I think I have any chance of\nsucceeding, Mademoiselle de Melvil seems the best qualified to render\nmy situation happy in all respects. Her fortune is more than sufficient\nto disembarrass my affairs; her good sense will be a seasonable check\nupon my vivacity; her agreeable accomplishments will engage a\ncontinuation of affection and regard. I know my own disposition well\nenough to think I shall become a most dutiful and tractable husband;\nand shall deem myself highly honoured in being more closely united to\nmy dear Count de Melvil, the son and representative of that worthy\nofficer under whom my youth was formed. If you will therefore sanction\nmy claim, I will forthwith begin my approaches, and doubt not, under\nyour auspices, to bring the place to a capitulation.”\n\nRenaldo was pleased with the frankness of this declaration, approved of\nhis demand, and desired him to depend upon his good offices with his\nsister, whom he sounded that same evening upon the subject,\nrecommending the Major to her favour, as a gentleman well worthy of her\nchoice. Mademoiselle, who had never been exercised in the coquetries of\nher sex, and was now arrived at those years when the vanity of youth\nought to yield to discretion, considered the proposal as a philosopher,\nand after due deliberation candidly owned she had no objection to the\nmatch. Farrel was accordingly introduced in the character of a lover,\nafter the permission of the Countess had been obtained; and he carried\non his addresses in the usual form, so much to the satisfaction of all\nconcerned in the event, that a day was appointed for the celebration of\nhis nuptials, when he entered into peaceable possession of his prize.\n\nA few days after this joyful occasion, while Renaldo was at Vienna,\nwhere he had been indulged with leave of absence for six months, and\nemployed in making preparations for his journey to Britain, he was one\nevening presented by his servant with a package from London, which he\nno sooner opened, than he found enclosed a letter directed to him, in\nthe handwriting of Monimia. He was so much affected at sight of those\nwell-known characters, that he stood motionless as a statue, eager to\nknow the contents, yet afraid to peruse the billet. While he hesitated\nin this suspense, he chanced to cast his eye on the inside of the\ncover, and perceived the name of his Jewish friend at the bottom of a\nfew lines, importing, that the enclosed was delivered to him by a\nphysician of his acquaintance, who had recommended it in a particular\nmanner to his care. This intimation served only to increase the\nmystery, and whet his impatience; and as he had the explanation in his\nhand, he summoned all his resolution to his aid, and, breaking the\nseal, began to read these words: “Renaldo will not suppose that this\naddress proceeds from interested motives, when he learns, that, before\nit can be presented to his view, the unfortunate Monimia will be no\nmore.”\n\nHere the light forsook Renaldo’s eyes, his knees knocked together, and\nhe fell at full length insensible on the floor. His valet, hearing the\nnoise, ran into the apartment, lifted him upon a couch, and despatched\na messenger for proper assistance, while he himself endeavoured to\nrecall his spirits by such applications as chance afforded. But before\nthe Count exhibited any signs of life, his brother-in-law entered his\nchamber by accident, and as soon as he recollected himself from the\nextreme confusion and concern produced by this melancholy spectacle, he\nperceived the fatal epistle, which Melvil, though insensible, still\nkept within his grasp; justly suspecting this to be the cause of that\nsevere paroxysm, he drew near the couch, and with difficulty read what\nis above rehearsed, and the sequel, to this effect:—\n\n“Yes, I have taken such measures as will prevent it from falling into\nyour hands, until after I shall have been released from a being\nembittered with inexpressible misery and anguish. It is not my\nintention, once loved, and ah! still too fondly remembered youth, to\nupbraid you as the source of that unceasing woe which hath been so long\nthe sole inhabitant of my lonely bosom. I will not call you inconstant\nor unkind. I dare not think you base or dishonourable; yet I was\nabruptly sacrificed to a triumphant rival, before I had learned to bear\nsuch mortification; before I had overcome the prejudices which I had\nimbibed in my father’s house. I was all at once abandoned to despair,\nto indigence, and distress, to the vile practices of a villain, who, I\nfear, hath betrayed us both. What have not I suffered from the insults\nand vicious designs of that wretch, whom you cherished in your bosom!\nYet to these I owe this near approach to that goal of peace, where the\ncanker-worm of sorrow will expire. Beware of that artful traitor; and,\noh! endeavour to overcome that levity of disposition, which, if\nindulged, will not only stain your reputation, but also debauch the\ngood qualities of your heart. I release you, in the sight of Heaven,\nfrom all obligations. If I have been injured, let not my wrongs be\nvisited on the head of Renaldo, for whom shall be offered up the last\nfervent prayers of the hapless Monimia.”\n\nThis letter was a clue to the labyrinth of Melvil’s distress. Though\nthe Major had never heard him mention the name of this beauty, he had\nreceived such hints from his own wife, as enabled him to comprehend the\nwhole of the Count’s disaster. By the administration of stimulating\nmedicines, Renaldo recovered his perception; but this was a cruel\nalternative, considering the situation of his thoughts. The first word\nhe pronounced was Monimia, with all the emphasis of the most violent\ndespair. He perused the letter, and poured forth incoherent execrations\nagainst Fathom and himself. He exclaimed, in a frantic tone, “She is\nlost for ever! murdered by my unkindness! We are both undone by the\ninfernal arts of Fathom! execrable monster! Restore her to my arms. If\nthou art not a fiend in reality, I will tear out thy false heart.”\n\nSo saying, he sprung upon his valet, who would have fallen a sacrifice\nto his undistinguishing fury, had not he been saved by the\ninterposition of Farrel and the family, who disengaged him from his\nmaster’s gripe by dint of force; yet, notwithstanding their joint\nendeavours, he broke from this restraint, leaped upon the floor, and\nseizing his sword, attempted to plunge it in his own breast. When he\nwas once more overcome by numbers, he cursed himself, and all those who\nwithheld him; swore he would not survive the fair victim who had\nperished by his credulity and indiscretion; and the agitation of his\nspirits increased to such a degree, that he was seized with strong\nconvulsions, which nature was scarce able to sustain. Every medical\nexpedient was used to quiet his perturbation, which at length yielded\nso far as to subside into a continual fever and confirmed delirium,\nduring which he ceased not to pour forth the most pathetic complaints,\ntouching his ruined love, and to rave about the ill-starred Monimia.\nThe Major, half distracted by the calamity of his friend, would have\nconcealed it from the knowledge of his family, had not the physician,\nby despairing of his life, laid him under the necessity of making them\nacquainted with his condition.\n\nThe Countess and Mrs. Farrel were no sooner informed of his case than\nthey hastened to the melancholy scene, where they found Renaldo\ndeprived of his senses, panting under the rage of an exasperated\ndisease. They saw his face distorted, and his eyes glaring with frenzy;\nthey heard him invoke the name of Monimia with a tenderness of accent\nwhich even the impulse of madness could not destroy. Then, with a\nsudden transition of tone and gesture, he denounced vengeance against\nher betrayer, and called upon the north wind to cool the fervour of his\nbrain. His hair hung in dishevelled parcels, his cheeks were wan, his\nlooks ghastly, his vigour was fled, and all the glory of his youth\nfaded; the physician hung his head in silence, the attendants wrung\ntheir hands in despair, and the countenance of his friend was bathed in\ntears.\n\nSuch a picture would have moved the most obdurate heart; what\nimpression then must it have made upon a parent and sister, melting\nwith all the enthusiasm of affection! The mother was struck dumb, and\nstupefied with grief; the sister threw herself on the bed in a\ntransport of sorrow, caught her loved Renaldo in her arms, and was,\nwith great difficulty, torn from his embrace. Such was the dismal\nreverse that overtook the late so happy family of Melvil; such was the\nextremity to which the treachery of Fathom had reduced his best\nbenefactor!\n\nThree days did nature struggle with surprising efforts, and then the\nconstitution seemed to sink under the victorious fever; yet, as his\nstrength diminished, his delirium abated, and on the fifth morning he\nlooked round, and recognised his weeping friends. Though now exhausted\nto the lowest ebb of life, he retained the perfect use of speech, and\nhis reason being quite unclouded, spoke to each with equal kindness and\ncomposure; he congratulated himself upon the sight of shore after the\nhorrors of such a tempest; called upon the Countess and his sister, who\nwere not permitted to see him at such a conjuncture; and being apprised\nby the Major of his reason for excluding them from his presence, he\napplauded his concern, bequeathed them to his future care, and took\nleave of that gentleman with a cordial embrace. Then he desired to be\nleft in private with a certain clergyman, who regulated the concerns of\nhis soul, and he being dismissed, turned his face from the light, in\nexpectation of his final discharge. In a few minutes all was still and\ndreary, he was no longer heard to breathe, no more the stream of life\nwas perceived to circulate, he was supposed to be absolved from all his\ncares, and an universal groan from the bystanders announced the decease\nof the gallant, generous, and tender-hearted Renaldo.\n\n“Come hither, ye whom the pride of youth and health, of birth and\naffluence inflames, who tread the flowery maze of pleasure, trusting to\nthe fruition of ever-circling joys; ye who glory in your\naccomplishments, who indulge the views of ambition, and lay schemes for\nfuture happiness and grandeur, contemplate here the vanity of life!\nbehold how low this excellent young man is laid! mowed down even in the\nblossom of his youth, when fortune seemed to open all her treasures to\nhis worth!”\n\nSuch were the reflections of the generous Farrel, who, while he\nperformed the last office of friendship, in closing the eyes of the\nmuch-lamented Melvil, perceived a warmth on the skin, which the hand of\ndeath seldom leaves unextinguished. This uncommon sensation he reported\nto the physician, who, though he could feel no pulsation of the heart\nor arteries, conjectured that life still lingered in some of its\ninterior haunts, and immediately ordered such applications to the\nextremities and surface of the body, as might help to concentrate and\nreinforce the natural heat.\n\nBy these prescriptions, which for some time produced no sensible\neffect, the embers were, in all probability, kept glowing, and the\nvital power revived, for, after a considerable pause, respiration was\ngradually renewed at long intervals, a languid motion was perceived at\nthe heart, a few feeble and irregular pulsations were felt at the\nwrist, the clay-coloured livery of death began to vanish from his face,\nthe circulation acquired new force, and he opened his eyes with a sigh,\nwhich proclaimed his return from the shades of death.\n\nWhen he recovered the faculty of swallowing, a cordial was\nadministered, and whether the fever abated, in consequence of the\nblood’s being cooled and condensed during the recess of action in the\nsolids, or nature, in that agony, had prepared a proper channel for the\nexpulsion of the disease, certain it is, he was from this moment rid of\nall bodily pain; he retrieved the animal functions, and nothing\nremained of his malady but an extreme weakness and languor, the effect\nof nature’s being fatigued in the battle she had won.\n\nUnutterable was the joy that took possession of his mother and sister\nwhen Farrel flew into her apartment to intimate this happy turn. Scarce\ncould they be restrained from pouring forth their transports in the\npresence of Renaldo, who was still too feeble to endure such\ncommunication; indeed, he was extremely mortified and dejected at this\nevent, which had diffused such pleasure and satisfaction among his\nfriends, for though his distemper was mastered, the fatal cause of it\nstill rankled at his heart, and he considered this respite from death\nas a protraction of his misery.\n\nWhen he was congratulated by the Major on the triumph of his\nconstitution, he replied, with a groan, “I would to heaven it had been\notherwise, for I am reserved for all the horrors of the most poignant\nsorrow and remorse. O Monimia! Monimia! I hoped by this time to have\nconvinced thy gentle shade, that I was, at least intentionally,\ninnocent of that ruthless barbarity which hath brought thee to an\nuntimely grave. Heaven and earth! do I still survive the consciousness\nof that dire catastrophe! and lives the atrocious villain who hath\nblasted all our hopes!”\n\nWith these last words the fire darted from his eyes, and his brother,\nsnatching this occasional handle for reconciling him to life, joined in\nhis exclamations against the treacherous Fathom, and observed, that he\nshould not, in point of honour, wish to die, until he should have\nsacrificed that traitor to the manes of the beauteous Monimia. This\nincitement acted as a spur upon exhausted nature, causing the blood to\ncirculate with fresh vigour, and encouraging him to take such\nsustenance as would recruit his strength, and repair the damage which\nhis health had sustained.\n\nHis sister assiduously attended him in his recovery, flattering his\nappetite, and amusing his sorrow at the same time; the clergyman\nassailed his despondence with religious weapons, as well as with\narguments drawn from philosophy; and the fury of his passions being\nalready expended, he became so tractable as to listen to his\nremonstrances. But notwithstanding the joint endeavours of all his\nfriends, a deep fixed melancholy remained after every consequence of\nhis disease had vanished. In vain they essayed to elude his grief by\ngaiety and diversions, in vain they tried to decoy his heart into some\nnew engagement.\n\nThese kind attempts served only to feed and nourish that melancholy\nwhich pined within his bosom. Monimia still haunted him in the midst of\nthese amusements, while his reflection whispered to him, “Pleasures\nlike these I might have relished with her participation.” That darling\nidea mingled in all the female assemblies at which he was present,\neclipsing their attractions, and enhancing the bitterness of his loss;\nfor absence, enthusiasm, and even his despair had heightened the charms\nof the fair orphan into something supernatural and divine.\n\nTime, that commonly weakens the traces of remembrance, seemed to deepen\nits impressions in his breast; nightly, in his dreams, did he converse\nwith his dear Monimia, sometimes on the verdant bank of a delightful\nstream, where he breathed, in soft murmurs, the dictates of his love\nand admiration; sometimes reclined within the tufted grove, his arm\nencircled and sustained her snowy neck, whilst she, with looks of love\nineffable, gazed on his face, invoking Heaven to bless her husband and\nher lord. Yet, even in these illusions was his fancy oft alarmed for\nthe ill-fated fair. Sometimes he viewed her tottering on the brink of a\nsteep precipice, far distant from his helping hand; at other times she\nseemed to sail along the boisterous tide, imploring his assistance,\nthen would he start with horror from his sleep, and feel his sorrows\nmore than realised; he deserted his couch, he avoided the society of\nmankind, he courted sequestered shades where he could indulge his\nmelancholy; there his mind brooded over his calamity until his\nimagination became familiar with all the ravages of death; it\ncontemplated the gradual decline of Monimia’s health, her tears, her\ndistress, her despair at his imagined cruelty; he saw, through that\nperspective, every blossom of her beauty wither, every sparkle vanish\nfrom her eyes; he beheld her faded lips, her pale cheek, and her\ninanimated features, the symmetry of which not death itself was able to\ndestroy. His fancy conveyed her breathless corse to the cold grave,\no’er which, perhaps, no tear humane was shed, where her delicate limbs\nwere consigned to dust, where she was dished out a delicious banquet to\nthe unsparing worm.\n\nOver these pictures he dwelt with a sort of pleasing anguish, until he\nbecame so enamoured of her tomb, that he could no longer resist the\ndesire that compelled him to make a pilgrimage to the dear hallowed\nspot, where all his once gay hopes lay buried; that he might nightly\nvisit the silent habitation of his ruined love, embrace the sacred\nearth with which she was now compounded, moisten it with his tears, and\nbid the turf lie easy on her breast. Besides the prospect of this\ngloomy enjoyment, he was urged to return to England, by an eager desire\nof taking vengeance on the perfidious Fathom, as well as of acquitting\nhimself of the obligations he owed in that kingdom, to those who had\nassisted him in his distress. He therefore communicated his intention\nto Farrel, who would have insisted upon attending him in the journey,\nhad not he been conjured to stay and manage Renaldo’s affairs in his\nabsence. Every previous step being taken, he took leave of the Countess\nand his sister, who had, with all their interest and elocution, opposed\nhis design, the execution of which, they justly feared, would, instead\nof dissipating, augment his chagrin; and now, seeing him determined,\nthey shed a flood of tears at his departure, and he set out from Vienna\nin a post-chaise, accompanied by a trusty valet-de-chambre on\nhorseback.\n\nCHAPTER SIXTY-ONE\n\nRENALDO MEETS WITH A LIVING MONUMENT OF JUSTICE, AND ENCOUNTERS A\nPERSONAGE OF SOME NOTE IN THESE MEMOIRS.\n\nAs this domestic was very well qualified for making all the proper\ndispositions, and adjusting every necessary article on the road,\nRenaldo totally abstracted himself from earthly considerations, and\nmused without ceasing on that theme which was the constant subject of\nhis contemplation. He was blind to the objects that surrounded him; he\nscarce ever felt the importunities of nature; and had not they been\nreinforced by the pressing entreaties of his attendant, he would have\nproceeded without refreshment or repose. In this absence of mind did he\ntraverse a great part of Germany, in his way to the Austrian\nNetherlands, and arrived at the fortress of Luxemburg, where he was\nobliged to tarry a whole day on account of an accident which had\nhappened to his chaise. Here he went to view the fortifications; and as\nhe walked along the ramparts, his ears were saluted with these words:\n“Heaven bless the noble Count de Melvil! will not he turn the eyes of\ncompassion on an old fellow-soldier reduced to misfortune and\ndisgrace?”\n\nSurprised at this address, which was attended with the clanking of\nchains, Renaldo lifted up his eyes, and perceived the person who spoke\nto be one of two malefactors shackled together, who had been sentenced\nfor some crime to work as labourers on the fortifications. His face was\nso covered with hair, and his whole appearance so disguised by the\nsqualid habit which he wore, that the Count could not recollect his\nfeatures, until he gave him to understand that his name was Ratchcali.\nMelvil immediately recognised his fellow-student at Vienna, and his\nbrother-volunteer upon the Rhine, and expressed equal surprise and\nconcern at seeing him in such a deplorable situation.\n\nNothing renders the soul so callous and insensible as the searing\nbrands of infamy and disgrace. Without betraying the least symptoms of\nshame or confusion, “Count,” says he, “this is the fate of war, at\nleast of the war in which I have been engaged, ever since I took leave\nof the Imperial army, and retreated with your old companion Fathom.\nLong life to that original genius! If he is not unhappily eclipsed by\nsome unfortunate interposition, before his terrene parts are purified,\nI foresee that he will shine a star of the first magnitude in the world\nof adventure.”\n\nAt mention of this detested name, Renaldo’s heart began to throb with\nindignation; yet he suppressed the emotion, and desired to know the\nmeaning of that splendid encomium which he had bestowed upon his\nconfederate. “It would be quite unnecessary,” replied Ratchcali, “for a\nman in my present situation to equivocate or disguise the truth. The\nnature of my disgrace is perfectly well known. I am condemned to hard\nlabour for life; and unless some lucky accident, which I cannot now\nforesee, shall intervene, all I can expect is some alleviation of my\nhard lot from the generosity of such gentlemen as you, who\ncompassionate the sufferings of your fellow-creatures. In order to\nengage your benevolence the more in my behalf, I shall, if you will\ngive me the hearing, faithfully inform you of some particulars, which\nit may import you to know, concerning my old acquaintance Ferdinand\nCount Fathom, whose real character hath perhaps hitherto escaped your\nnotice.”\n\nThen he proceeded to give a regular detail of all the strokes of\nfinesse which he, in conjunction with our adventurer, had practised\nupon Melvil and others, during their residence at Vienna, and the\ncampaigns they had made upon the Rhine. He explained the nature of the\nrobbery which was supposed to have been done by the Count’s valet,\ntogether with the manner of their desertion. He described his\nseparation from Fathom, their meeting at London, the traffic they\ncarried on in copartnership; and the misfortune that reduced Ferdinand\nto the condition in which he was found by Melvil.\n\n“After having gratified the honest lawyer,” said he, “with a share of\nthe unfortunate Fathom’s spoils, and packed up all my own valuable\neffects, my new auxiliary Maurice and I posted to Harwich, embarked in\nthe packet-boat, and next day arrived at Helvoetsluys; from thence we\nrepaired to the Hague, in order to mingle in the gaieties of the place,\nand exercise our talents at play, which is there cultivated with\nuniversal eagerness. But, chancing to meet with an old acquaintance,\nwhom I did not at all desire to see, I found it convenient to withdraw\nsoftly to Rotterdam; from whence we set out for Antwerp; and, having\nmade a tour of the Austrian Netherlands, set up our rest at Brussels,\nand concerted a plan for laying the Flemings under contribution.\n\n“From our appearance we procured admission into the most polite\nassemblies, and succeeded to a wonder in all our operations; until our\ncareer was unfortunately checked by the indiscretion of my ally, who,\nbeing detected in the very act of conveying a card, was immediately\nintroduced to a magistrate. And this minister of justice was so\ncurious, inquisitive, and clear-sighted, that Count Maurice, finding it\nimpossible to elude his penetration, was fain to stipulate for his own\nsafety, by giving up his friend to the cognisance of the law. I was\naccordingly apprehended, before I knew the cause of my arrest; and\nbeing unhappily known by some soldiers of the Prince’s guard, my\ncharacter turned out so little to the approbation of the inquisitors,\nthat all my effects were confiscated for the benefit of the state, and\nI was by a formal sentence condemned to labour on the fortifications\nall the days of my life; while Maurice escaped at the expense of five\nhundred stripes, which he received in public from the hands of the\ncommon executioner.\n\n“Thus have I, without evasion or mental reservation, given a faithful\naccount of the steps by which I have arrived at this barrier, which is\nlikely to be the ne plus ultra of my peregrinations, unless the\ngenerous Count de Melvil will deign to interpose his interest in behalf\nof an old fellow-soldier, who may yet live to justify his mediation.”\n\nRenaldo had no reason to doubt the truth of this story, every\ncircumstance of which tended to corroborate the intelligence he had\nalready received touching the character of Fathom, whom he now\nconsidered with a double portion of abhorrence, as the most abandoned\nmiscreant that nature had ever produced. Though Ratchcali did not\npossess a much higher place in his opinion, he favoured him with marks\nof his bounty, and exhorted him, if possible, to reform his heart; but\nhe would by no means promise to interpose his credit in favour of a\nwretch self-convicted of such enormous villany and fraud. He could not\nhelp moralising upon this rencontre, which inspired him with great\ncontempt for human nature. And next day he proceeded on his journey\nwith a heavy heart, ruminating on the perfidy of mankind, and, between\nwhiles, transported with the prospect of revenging all his calamities\nupon the accursed author.\n\nWhile he was wrapped up in these reveries, his carriage rolled along,\nand had already entered a wood between Mons and Tournay, when his dream\nwas suddenly interrupted by the explosion of several pistols that were\nfired among the thickets at a little distance from the road. Roused at\nthis alarm, he snatched his sword that stood by him, and springing from\nthe chaise, ran directly towards the spot, being close followed by his\nvalet, who had alighted and armed himself with a pistol in each hand.\nAbout forty yards from the highway, they arrived in a little glade or\nopening, where they saw a single man standing at bay against five\nbanditti, after having killed one of their companions, and lost his own\nhorse, that lay dead upon the ground.\n\nMelvil seeing this odds, and immediately guessing their design, rushed\namong them without hesitation, and in an instant ran his sword through\nthe heart of one whose hand was raised to smite the gentleman behind,\nwhile he was engaged with the rest in front. At the same time the valet\ndisabled another by a shot in the shoulder; so that the number being\nnow equal on both sides, a furious combat ensued, every man being\npaired with an antagonist, and each having recourse to swords, as all\ntheir pieces had been discharged. Renaldo’s adversary, finding himself\npressed with equal fury and skill, retreated gradually among the trees,\nuntil he vanished altogether into the thickest of the wood; and his two\ncompanions followed his example with great ease, the valet-de-chambre\nbeing hurt in the leg, and the stranger so much exhausted by the wounds\nhe had received before Renaldo’s interposition, that, when the young\ngentleman approached to congratulate him on the defeat of the robbers,\nhe, in advancing to embrace his deliverer, dropped down motionless on\nthe grass.\n\nThe Count, with that warmth of sympathy and benevolence which was\nnatural to his heart, lifted up the wounded cavalier in his arms, and\ncarried him to the chaise, in which he was deposited, while the\nvalet-de-chambre reloaded his pistols, and prepared for a second\nattack, as they did not doubt that the banditti would return with a\nreinforcement. However, before they reappeared, Renaldo’s driver\ndisengaged him from the wood, and in less than a quarter of an hour\nthey arrived at a village, where they halted for assistance to the\nstranger, who, though still alive, had not recovered the use of his\nsenses.\n\nAfter he was undressed, and laid in a warm bed, a surgeon examined his\nbody, and found a wound in his neck by a sword, and another in his\nright side, occasioned by a pistol-shot; so that his prognostic was\nvery dubious. Meanwhile, he applied proper dressings to both; and, in\nhalf an hour after this administration, the gentleman gave some tokens\nof perception. He looked around him with a wildness of fury in his\naspect, as if he had thought himself in the hands of the robbers by\nwhom he had been attacked. But, when he saw the assiduity with which\nthe bystanders exerted themselves in his behalf, one raising his head\nfrom the pillow, while another exhorted him to swallow a little wine\nwhich was warmed for the purpose; when he beheld the sympathising looks\nof all present, and heard himself accosted in the most cordial terms by\nthe person whom he recollected as his deliverer, all the severity\nvanished from his countenance; he took Renaldo’s hand, and pressed it\nto his lips; and, while the tears gushed from his eyes, “Praised be\nGod,” said he, “that virtue and generosity are still to be found among\nthe sons of men.”\n\nEverybody in the apartment was affected by this exclamation; and\nMelvil, above all the rest, felt such emotions as he could scarcely\nrestrain. He entreated the gentleman to believe himself in the midst of\nsuch friends as would effectually secure him from all violence and\nmortification; he conjured him to compose the perturbation of his\nspirits, and quiet the apprehensions of his mind with that reflection;\nand protested, that he himself would not quit the house while his\nattendance should be deemed necessary for the stranger’s cure, or his\nconversation conducive to his amusement.\n\nThese assurances, considered with the heroic part which the young\nHungarian had already acted in his behalf, inspired the cavalier with\nsuch a sublime idea of Melvil, that he gazed upon him with silent\nastonishment, as an angel sent from heaven for his succour; and, in the\ntransport of his gratitude, could not help exclaiming, “Sure Providence\nhath still something in reserve for this unfortunate wretch, in whose\nfavour such a miracle of courage and generosity hath interposed!”\n\nBeing accommodated with proper care and attendance, his constitution in\na little time overcame the fever; and, at the third dressing, the\nsurgeon declared him out of all danger from his wounds. Then was\nRenaldo indulged with opportunities of conversing with the patient, and\nof inquiring into the particulars of his fortune and designs in life,\nwith a view to manifest the inclination he felt to serve him in his\nfuture occasions.\n\nThe more this stranger contemplated the character of the Count, the\nmore his amazement increased, on account of his extraordinary\nbenevolence in favour of a person whose merit he could not possibly\nknow; he even expressed his surprise on this subject to Renaldo, who at\nlength told him, that, although his best offices should always be ready\nfor the occasions of any gentleman in distress, his particular\nattachment and regard to him was improved by an additional\nconsideration. “I am no stranger,” said he, “to the virtues and honour\nof the gallant Don Diego de Zelos.”\n\n“Heaven and earth!” cried the stranger, starting from his seat with\nextreme emotion, “do I then live to hear myself addressed by that\nlong-lost appellation! my heart glows at the expression! my spirits are\nkindled with a flame that thrills through every nerve! Say, young\ngentleman, if you are really an inhabitant of earth, by what means are\nyou acquainted with the unhappy name of Zelos?”\n\nIn answer to this eager interrogation, Renaldo gave him to understand,\nthat in the course of his travels, he had resided a short time at\nSeville, where he had frequently seen Don Diego, and often heard his\ncharacter mentioned with uncommon esteem and veneration. “Alas!”\nreplied the Castilian, “that justice is no longer done to the wretched\nZelos; his honours are blasted, and his reputation canker-bitten by the\nvenomous tooth of slander.”\n\nHe then proceeded to unfold his misfortunes, as they have already been\nexplained in the former part of these memoirs; at the recapitulation of\nwhich, the heart of Melvil, being intendered by his own calamities, was\nso deeply affected, that he re-echoed the groans of Don Diego, and wept\nover his sufferings with the most filial sympathy. When he repeated the\nstory of that cruel fraud which was practised upon him by the faithless\nFadini, Melvil, whose mind and imagination teemed with the villanies of\nFathom, was immediately struck with the conjecture of his being the\nknave; because, indeed, he could not believe that any other person was\nso abandoned by principle and humanity as to take such a barbarous\nadvantage of a gentleman in distress.\n\nCHAPTER SIXTY-TWO\n\nHIS RETURN TO ENGLAND, AND MIDNIGHT PILGRIMAGE TO MONIMIA’S TOMB.\n\nHe considered the date of that unparalleled transaction, which agreed\nwith his conjecture, and from the inquiries he made concerning the\nperson of the traitor, gathered reasons sufficient to confirm his\nsupposition. Thus certified, “That is the villain,” cried the Count,\n“whose infernal arts have overwhelmed me with such misery as Heaven\nitself hath made no remedy to dispel! To revenge my wrongs on that\nperfidious miscreant, is one of the chief reasons for which I deign to\ndrag about an hateful being. O Don Diego! what is life, when all its\nenjoyments are so easily poisoned by the machinations of such a worm!”\nSo saying, he smote his breast in all the agony of woe, and besought\nthe Spaniard to relate the steps he took in consequence of this\ndisaster.\n\nThe Castilian’s cheeks reddened at this information, which enforced his\nown resentment, and casting up his eyes to heaven, “Sacred powers!”\ncried he, “let him not perish, before you bring him within my reach.\nYou ask me, noble cavalier, what measures I took in this abyss of\nmisery? For the first day, I was tortured with apprehensions for the\nfriendly Fadini, fearing that he had been robbed and murdered for the\njewels which he had, perhaps, too unwarily exposed to sale. But this\nterror soon vanished before the true presages of my fate, when, on the\nmorrow, I found the whole family in tears and confusion, and heard my\nlandlord pour forth the most bitter imprecations against the fugitive,\nwho had deflowered his daughter, and even robbed the house. You will\nask, which of the passions of my heart were interested on this\noccasion? they were shame and indignation. All my grief flowed in\nanother channel; I blushed to find my judgment deceived; I scorned to\ncomplain; but, in my heart, denounced vengeance against my base\nbetrayer. I silently retired to my apartment, in order to commune with\nmy own thoughts.\n\n“I had borne greater calamities without being driven to despair; I\nsummoned all my fortitude to my assistance, and resolved to live in\nspite of affliction. Thus determined, I betook myself to the house of a\ngeneral officer, whose character was fair in the world; and having\nobtained admission in consequence of my Oriental appearance, ‘To a man\nof honour,’ said I, ‘the unfortunate need no introduction. My habit\nproclaims me a Persian; this passport from the States of Holland will\nconfirm that supposition. I have been robbed of jewels to a\nconsiderable value, by a wretch whom I favoured with my confidence; and\nnow, reduced to extreme indigence, I come to offer myself as a soldier\nin the armies of France. I have health and strength sufficient to\ndischarge that duty. Nor am I unacquainted with a military life, which\nwas once my glory and occupation. I therefore sue for your protection,\nthat I may be received, though in the lowest order of them that serve\nthe King; and that your future favour may depend upon my behaviour in\nthat capacity.’\n\n“The general, surprised at my declaration, surveyed me with uncommon\nattention; he perused my certificate; asked divers questions concerning\nthe art of war, to which I returned such answers as convinced him that\nI was not wholly ignorant in that particular. In short, I was enlisted\nas a volunteer in his own regiment, and soon after promoted to the rank\nof a subaltern, and the office of equerry to his own son, who, at that\ntime, had attained to the degree of colonel, though his age did not\nexceed eighteen years.\n\n“This young man was naturally of a ferocious disposition, which had\nbeen rendered quite untractable by the pride of birth and fortune,\ntogether with the licence of his education. As he did not know the\nrespect due to a gentleman, so he could not possibly pay it to those\nwho were, unfortunately, under his command. Divers mortifications I\nsustained with that fortitude which became a Castilian who lay under\nobligations to the father; till, at length, laying aside all decorum,\nhe smote me. Sacred Heaven! he smote Don Diego de Zelos, in presence of\nhis whole household.\n\n“Had my sword been endowed with sensation, it would of itself have\nstarted from its scabbard at this indignity offered to its master. I\nunsheathed it without deliberation, saying, ‘Know, insolent boy, he is\na gentleman whom thou hast outraged; and thou hast thus cancelled the\nties which have hitherto restrained my indignation.’ His servants would\nhave interposed, but he commanded them to retire; and, flushed with\nthat confidence which the impetuosity of his temper inspired, he drew,\nin his turn, and attacked me with redoubled rage; but his dexterity\nbeing very unequal to his courage, he was soon disarmed, and\noverthrown; when, pointing my sword to his breast, ‘In consideration of\nthy youth and ignorance,’ said I, ‘I spare that life which thou hast\nforfeited by thy ungenerous presumption.’\n\n“With these words, I put up my weapon, retired through the midst of his\ndomestics, who, seeing their master safe, did not think proper to\noppose my passage, and, mounting my horse, in less than two hours\nentered the Austrian dominions, resolving to proceed as far as Holland,\nthat I might embark in the first ship for Spain, in order to wash away,\nwith my own blood, or that of my enemies, the cruel stain which hath so\nlong defiled my reputation.\n\n“This was the grievance that still corroded my heart, and rendered\nineffectual the inhuman sacrifice I had made to my injured honour. This\nwas the consideration that incessantly prompted, and still importunes\nme to run every risk of life and fortune, rather than leave my fame\nunder such an ignominious aspersion. I purpose to obey this internal\ncall. I am apt to believe it is the voice of Heaven—of that Providence\nwhich manifested its care by sending such a generous auxiliary to my\naid, when I was overpowered by banditti, on the very first day of my\nexpedition.”\n\nHaving in this manner gratified the curiosity of his deliverer, he\nexpressed a desire of knowing the quality of him to whom he was so\nsignally obliged; and Renaldo did not scruple to make the Castilian\nacquainted with his name and family. He likewise communicated the story\nof his unfortunate love, with all the symptoms of unutterable woe,\nwhich drew tears from the noble-hearted Spaniard, while, with a groan,\nthat announced the load which overwhelmed his soul, “I had a daughter,”\nsaid he, “such as you describe the peerless Monimia; had Heaven decreed\nher for the arms of such a lover, I, who am now the most wretched,\nshould have been the most happy parent upon earth.”\n\nThus did these new friends alternately indulge their mutual sorrow, and\nconcert measures for their future operations. Melvil earnestly\nsolicited the Castilian to favour him with his company to England,\nwhere, in all probability, both would enjoy the gloomy satisfaction of\nbeing revenged upon their common betrayer, Fathom; and, as a farther\ninducement, he assured him, that, as soon as he should have\naccomplished the melancholy purposes of his voyage, he would accompany\nDon Diego to Spain, and employ his whole interest and fortune in his\nservice. The Spaniard, thunderstruck at the extravagant generosity of\nthis proposal, could scarce believe the evidence of his own senses;\nand, after some pause, replied, “My duty would teach me to obey any\ncommand you should think proper to impose; but here my inclination and\ninterest are so agreeably flattered, that I should be equally\nungrateful and unwise, in pretending to comply with reluctance.”\n\nThis point being settled, they moved forwards to Mons, as soon as Don\nDiego was in a condition to bear the shock of such a removal, and there\nremaining until his wounds were perfectly cured, they hired a\npost-chaise for Ostend, embarked in a vessel at that port, reached the\nopposite shore of England, after a short and easy passage, and arrived\nin London without having met with any sinister accident on the road.\n\nAs they approached this capital, Renaldo’s grief seemed to regurgitate\nwith redoubled violence. His memory was waked to the most minute and\npainful exertion of its faculties; his imagination teemed with the most\nafflicting images, and his impatience became so ardent, that never\nlover panted more eagerly for the consummation of his wishes, than\nMelvil, for an opportunity of stretching himself upon the grave of the\nlost Monimia. The Castilian was astonished, as well as affected, at the\npoignancy of his grief, which, as a proof of his susceptibility and\nvirtue, endeared him still more to his affection; and though his own\nmisfortunes had rendered him very unfit for the office of a comforter,\nhe endeavoured, by soothing discourse, to moderate the excess of his\nfriend’s affliction.\n\nThough it was dark when they alighted at the inn, Melvil ordered a\ncoach to be called; and, being attended by the Spaniard, who would not\nbe persuaded to quit him upon such an occasion, he repaired to the\nhouse of the generous Jew, whose rheum distilled very plentifully at\nhis approach. The Count had already acquitted himself in point of\npecuniary obligations to this benevolent Hebrew; and now, after having\nmade such acknowledgments as might be expected from a youth of his\ndisposition, he begged to know by what channel he had received that\nletter which he had been so kind as to forward to Vienna.\n\nJoshua, who was ignorant of the contents of that epistle, and saw the\nyoung gentleman extremely moved, would have eluded his inquiry, by\npretending he had forgot the circumstance; but when he understood the\nnature of the case which was not explained without the manifestation of\nthe utmost inquietude, he heartily condoled the desponding lover,\ntelling him he had in vain employed all his intelligence about that\nunfortunate beauty, in consequence of Melvil’s letter to him on that\nsubject; and then directed him to the house of the physician, who had\nbrought the fatal billet which had made him miserable.\n\nNo sooner did he receive this information than he took his leave\nabruptly, with promise of returning next day, and hied him to the\nlodgings of that gentleman, whom he was lucky enough to find at home.\nBeing favoured with a private audience, “When I tell you,” said he,\n“that my name is Renaldo Count de Melvil, you will know me to be the\nmost unfortunate of men. By that letter, which you committed to the\ncharge of my worthy friend Joshua, the fatal veil was removed from my\neyes, which had been so long darkened by the artifices of incredible\ndeceit, and my own incurable misery fully presented to my view. If you\nwere acquainted with the unhappy fair, who hath fallen a victim to my\nmistake, you will have some idea of the insufferable pangs which I now\nfeel in recollecting her fate. If you have compassion for these pangs,\nyou will not refuse to conduct me to the spot where the dear remains of\nMonimia are deposited; there let me enjoy a full banquet of woe; there\nlet me feast that worm of sorrow that preys upon my heart. For such\nentertainment have I revisited this (to me) ill-omened isle; for this\nsatisfaction I intrude upon your condescension at these unseasonable\nhours; for to such a degree of impatience is my affliction whetted,\nthat no slumber shall assail mine eyelids, no peace reside within my\nbosom, until I shall have adored that earthly shrine where my Monimia\nlies! Yet would I know the circumstances of her fate. Did Heaven ordain\nno angel to minister to her distress? were her last moments\ncomfortless? ha! was not she abandoned to indigence, to insults; left\nin the power of that inhuman villain who betrayed us both? Sacred\nHeaven! why did Providence wink at the triumph of such consummate\nperfidy?”\n\nThe physician, having listened with complacency to this effusion,\nreplied, “It is my profession, it is my nature to sympathise with the\nafflicted. I am a judge of your feelings, because I know the value of\nyour loss. I attended the incomparable Monimia in her last illness, and\nam well enough acquainted with her story to conclude that she fell a\nsacrifice to an unhappy misunderstanding, effected and fomented by that\ntraitor who abused your mutual confidence.”\n\nHe then proceeded to inform him of all the particulars which we have\nalready recorded, touching the destiny of the beauteous orphan, and\nconcluded with telling him he was ready to yield him any other\nsatisfaction which it was in his power to grant. The circumstances of\nthe tale had put Renaldo’s spirits into such commotion, that he could\nutter nothing but interjections and unconnected words. When Fathom’s\nbehaviour was described, he trembled with fierce agitation, started\nfrom his chair, pronouncing, “Monster! fiend! but we shall one day\nmeet.”\n\nWhen he was made acquainted with the benevolence of the French lady, he\nexclaimed, “O heaven-born charity and compassion! sure that must be\nsome spirit of grace sent hither to mitigate the tortures of life!\nwhere shall I find her, to offer up my thanks and adoration?” Having\nheard the conclusion of the detail, he embraced the relater, as the\nkind benefactor of Monimia, shed a flood of tears in his bosom, and\npressed him to crown the obligation, by conducting him to the solitary\nplace where now she rested from all her cares.\n\nThe gentleman perceiving the transports of his grief were such as could\nnot be opposed, complied with his request, attended him in the vehicle,\nand directed the coachman to drive to a sequestered field, at some\ndistance from the city, where stood the church, within whose awful\naisle this scene was to be acted. The sexton being summoned from his\nbed, produced the keys, in consequence of a gratification, after the\nphysician had communed with him apart, and explained the intention of\nRenaldo’s visit.\n\nDuring this pause the soul of Melvil was wound up to the highest pitch\nof enthusiastic sorrow. The uncommon darkness of the night, the solemn\nsilence, and lonely situation of the place, conspired with the occasion\nof his coming, and the dismal images of his fancy, to produce a real\nrapture of gloomy expectation, which the whole world would not have\npersuaded him to disappoint. The clock struck twelve, the owl screeched\nfrom the ruined battlement, the door was opened by the sexton, who, by\nthe light of a glimmering taper, conducted the despairing lover to a\ndreary aisle, and stamped upon the ground with his foot, saying, “Here\nthe young lady lies interred.”\n\nMelvil no sooner received this intimation, than falling on his knees,\nand pressing his lips to the hallowed earth, “Peace,” cried he, “to the\ngentle tenant of this silent habitation.” Then turning to the\nbystanders, with a bloodshot eye, said, “Leave me to the full enjoyment\nof this occasion; my grief is too delicate to admit the company even of\nmy friends. The rites to be performed require privacy; adieu, then,\nhere must I pass the night alone.”\n\nThe doctor, alarmed at this declaration, which he was afraid imported\nsome resolution fatal to his own life, began to repent of having been\naccessory to the visit, attempted to dissuade him from his purpose, and\nfinding him obstinately determined, called in the assistance of the\nsexton and coachman, and solicited the aid of Don Diego, to force\nRenaldo from the execution of his design.\n\nThe Castilian knowing his friend was then very unfit for common\naltercation, interposed in the dispute, saying, “You need not be afraid\nthat he will obey the dictates of despair; his religion, his honour\nwill baffle such temptations; he hath promised to reserve his life for\nthe occasions of his friend; and he shall not be disappointed in his\npresent aim.” In order to corroborate this peremptory address, which\nwas delivered in the French language, he unsheathed his sword, and the\nothers retreating at sight of his weapon, “Count,” said he, “enjoy your\ngrief in full transport; I will screen you from interruption, though at\nthe hazard of my life; and while you give a loose to sorrow, within the\nghastly vault, I will watch till morning in the porch, and meditate\nupon the ruin of my own family and peace.”\n\nHe accordingly prevailed upon the physician to retire, after he had\nsatisfied the sexton, and ordered the coachman to return by break of\nday.\n\nRenaldo, thus left alone, prostrated himself upon the grave, and poured\nforth such lamentations as would have drawn tears from the most savage\nhearer. He called aloud upon Monimia’s name, “Are these the nuptial\njoys to which our fate hath doomed us? Is this the fruit of those\nendearing hopes, that intercourse divine, that raptured admiration, in\nwhich so many hours insensibly elapsed? where now are those attractions\nto which I yielded up my captive heart? quenched are those genial eyes\nthat gladdened each beholder, and shone the planets of my happiness and\npeace! cold! cold and withered are those lips that swelled with love,\nand far outblushed the damask rose! and ah! forever silenced is that\ntongue, whose eloquence had power to lull the pangs of misery and care!\nno more shall my attention be ravished with the music of that voice,\nwhich used to thrill in soft vibrations to my soul! O sainted spirit! O\nunspotted shade of her whom I adored; of her whose memory I shall still\nrevere with ever-bleeding sorrow and regret; of her whose image will be\nthe last idea that forsakes this hapless bosom! now art thou conscious\nof my integrity and love; now dost thou behold the anguish that I feel.\nIf the pure essence of thy nature will permit, wilt thou, ah! wilt thou\nindulge this wretched youth with some kind signal of thy notice, with\nsome token of thy approbation? wilt thou assume a medium of embodied\nair, in semblance of that lovely form which now lies mouldering in this\ndreary tomb, and speak the words of peace to my distempered soul!\nReturn, Monimia, appear, though but for one short moment, to my longing\neyes! vouchsafe one smile! Renaldo will be satisfied; Renaldo’s heart\nwill be at rest; his grief no more will overflow its banks, but glide\nwith equal current to his latest hour! Alas! these are the raving of my\ndelirious sorrow! Monimia hears not my complaints; her soul, sublimed\nfar, far above all sublunary cares, enjoys that felicity of which she\nwas debarred on earth. In vain I stretch these eyes, environed with\ndarkness undistinguishing and void. No object meets my view; no sound\nsalutes mine ear, except the noisy wind that whistles through these\nvaulted caves of death.”\n\nIn this kind of exclamation did Renaldo pass the night, not without a\ncertain species of woful enjoyment, which the soul is often able to\nconjure up from the depths of distress; insomuch that, when the morning\nintruded on his privacy, he could scarce believe it was the light of\nday, so fast had fleeted the minutes of his devotion.\n\nHis heart being thus disburdened, and his impatience gratified, he\nbecame so calm and composed, that Don Diego was equally pleased and\nastonished at the air of serenity with which he came forth, and\nembraced him with warm acknowledgments of his goodness and attachment.\nHe frankly owned, that his mind was now more at ease than he had ever\nfound it, since he first received the fatal intimation of his loss;\nthat a few such feasts would entirely moderate the keen appetite of his\nsorrow, which he would afterwards feed with less precipitation.\n\nHe also imparted to the Castilian the plan of a monument, which he had\ndesigned for the incomparable Monimia; and Don Diego was so much struck\nwith the description, that he solicited his advice in projecting\nanother, of a different nature, to be erected to the memory of his own\nill-fated wife and daughter, should he ever be able to re-establish\nhimself in Spain.\n\nCHAPTER SIXTY-THREE\n\nHE RENEWS THE RITES OF SORROW, AND IS ENTRANCED.\n\nWhile they amused themselves with this sort of conversation, the\nphysician returned with the coach, and accompanied them back to their\ninn, where he left them to their repose, after having promised to call\nagain at noon, and conduct Renaldo to the house of Madam Clement, the\nbenefactress of Monimia, to whom he eagerly desired to be introduced.\n\nThe appointment was observed with all imaginable punctuality on both\nsides. Melvil had arrayed himself in a suit of deep mourning, and he\nfound the good lady in the like habit, assumed upon the same occasion.\nThe goodness of her heart was manifest in her countenance; the\nsensibility of the youth discovered itself in a flood of tears, which\nhe shed at her appearance. His sensations were too full for utterance;\nnor was she, for some time, able to give him welcome. While she led him\nby the hand to a seat, the drops of sympathy rushed into either eye;\nand at length she broke silence, saying, “Count, we must acquiesce in\nthe dispensations of Providence; and quiet the transports of our grief,\nwith a full assurance that Monimia is happy.”\n\nThis name was the key that unlocked the faculty of his speech. “I must\nstrive,” said he, “to ease the anguish of my heart with that\nconsolation. But say, humane, benevolent lady, to whose compassion and\ngenerosity that hapless orphan was indebted for the last peaceful\nmoment she enjoyed upon earth; say, in all your acquaintance with human\nnature, in all your intercourse with the daughters of men, in all the\nexercise of your charity and beneficence, did you ever observe such\nsweetness, purity, and truth; such beauty, sense, and perfection, as\nthat which was the inheritance of her whose fate I shall for ever\ndeplore?”—“She was, indeed,” replied the lady, “the best and fairest of\nour sex.”\n\nThis was the beginning of a conversation touching that lovely victim,\nin the course of which he explained those wicked arts which Fathom\npractised to alienate his affections from the adorable Monimia; and she\ndescribed the cunning hints and false insinuations by which that\ntraitor had aspersed the unsuspecting lover, and soiled his character\nin the opinion of the virtuous orphan. The intelligence he obtained on\nthis occasion added indignation to his grief. The whole mystery of\nMonimia’s behaviour, which he could not before explain, now stood\ndisclosed before him. He saw the gradual progress of that infernal plan\nwhich had been laid for their mutual ruin; and his soul was inflamed\nwith such desire of vengeance, that he would have taken his leave\nabruptly, in order to set on foot an immediate inquiry about the\nperfidious author of his wrongs, that he might exterminate such a\nmonster of iniquity from the face of the earth. But he was restrained\nby Madam Clement, who gave him to understand, that Fathom was already\novertaken by the vengeance of Heaven; for she had traced him in all the\ncourse of his fortune, from his first appearance in the medical sphere\nto his total eclipse. She represented the villain as a wretch\naltogether unworthy of his attention. She said, he was so covered with\ninfamy, that no person could enter the lists against him, without\nbearing away some stain of dishonour; that he was, at present,\npeculiarly protected by the law, and sheltered from the resentment of\nRenaldo, in the cavern of his disgrace.\n\nMelvil, glowing with rage, replied, that he was a venomous serpent,\nwhich it was incumbent on every foot to crush; that it was the duty of\nevery man to contribute his whole power in freeing society from such a\npernicious hypocrite; and that, if such instances of perfidy and\ningratitude were suffered to pass with impunity, virtue and\nplain-dealing would soon be expelled from the habitations of men. “Over\nand above these motives,” said he, “I own myself so vitiated with the\nalloy of human passion and infirmity, that I desire—I eagerly pant for\nan occasion of meeting him hand to hand, where I may upbraid him with\nhis treachery, and shower down vengeance and destruction on his\nperfidious head.”\n\nThen he recounted the anecdotes of our adventurer which he had learned\nin Germany and Flanders, and concluded with declaring his unalterable\nresolution of releasing him from jail, that he might have an\nopportunity of sacrificing him, with his own hand, to the manes of\nMonimia. The discreet lady, perceiving the perturbation of his mind,\nwould not further combat the impetuosity of his passion; contenting\nherself with exacting a promise, that he would not execute his purpose,\nuntil he should have deliberated three days upon the consequences by\nwhich a step of that kind might be attended. Before the expiration of\nthat term, she thought measures might be taken to prevent the young\ngentleman from exposing his life or reputation to unnecessary hazard.\n\nHaving complied with her request in this particular, he took his leave,\nafter he had, by repeated entreaties, prevailed upon her to accept a\njewel, in token of his veneration for the kind benefactress of the\ndeceased Monimia; nor could his generous heart be satisfied, until he\nhad forced a considerable present on the humane physician who had\nattended her in her last moments, and now discovered a particular\nsympathy and concern for her desponding lover. This gentleman attended\nhim to the house of the benevolent Joshua, where they dined, and where\nDon Diego was recommended, in the most fervid terms of friendship, to\nthe good offices of their host. Not that this duty was performed in\npresence of the stranger—Renaldo’s delicacy would not expose his friend\nto such a situation. While the physician, before dinner, entertained\nthat stranger in one apartment, Melvil withdrew into another, with the\nJew, to whom he disclosed the affair of the Castilian, with certain\ncircumstances, which shall, in due time, be revealed.\n\nJoshua’s curiosity being whetted by this information, he could not help\neyeing the Spaniard at table with such a particular stare, that Don\nDiego perceived his attention, and took umbrage at the freedom of his\nregard. Being unable to conceal his displeasure, he addressed himself\nto the Hebrew, with great solemnity, in the Spanish tongue, saving,\n“Signior, is there any singularity in my appearance? or, do you\nrecollect the features of Don Diego de Zelos?”\n\n“Signior Don Diego,” replied the other in pure Castilian, “I crave your\npardon for the rudeness of my curiosity, which prompted me to survey a\nnobleman, whose character I revere, and to whose misfortunes I am no\nstranger. Indeed, were curiosity alone concerned, I should be without\nexcuse; but as I am heartily inclined to serve you, as far as my weak\nabilities extend, I hope your generosity will not impute any little\ninvoluntary trespass of punctilio to my want of cordiality or esteem.”\n\nThe Spaniard was not only appeased by this apology, but also affected\nwith the compliment, and the language in which it was conveyed. He\nthanked the Jew for his kind declaration, entreated him to bear, with\nthe peevishness of a disposition sore with the galling hand of\naffliction; and, turning up his eyes to Heaven, “Were it possible,”\ncried he, “for fate to reconcile contradictions, and recall the\nirremediable current of events, I would now believe that there was\nhappiness still in reserve for the forlorn Zelos, now that I tread the\nland of freedom and humanity, now that I find myself befriended by the\nmost generous of men. Alas! I ask not happiness! If, by the kind\nendeavours of the gallant Count de Melvil, to whom I am already\nindebted for my life, and by the efforts of his friends, the honour of\nmy name shall be purified and cleared from the poisonous stains of\nmalice by which it is at present spotted, I shall then enjoy all that\nsatisfaction which destiny can bestow upon a wretch whose woes are\nincurable.”\n\nRenaldo comforted him with the assurance of his being on the eve of\ntriumphing over his adversaries; and Joshua confirmed the consolation,\nby giving him to understand, that he had correspondents in Spain of\nsome influence in the state; that he had already written to them on the\nsubject of Don Diego, in consequence of a letter which he had received\nfrom Melvil while he tarried at Mons, and that he, every post, expected\na favourable answer on that subject.\n\nAfter dinner, the physician took his leave, though not before he had\npromised to meet Renaldo at night, and accompany him in the repetition\nof his midnight visit to Monimia’s tomb; for this pilgrimage the\nunfortunate youth resolved nightly to perform during the whole time of\nhis residence in England. It was, indeed, a sort of pleasure, the\nprospect of which enabled him to bear the toil of living through the\nday, though his patience was almost quite exhausted before the hour of\nassignation arrived.\n\nWhen the doctor appeared with the coach, he leaped into it with great\neagerness, after he had, with much difficulty, prevailed with Don Diego\nto stay at home, on account of his health, which was not yet perfectly\nestablished. The Castilian, however, would not comply with his request,\nuntil he had obtained the Count’s promise, that he should be permitted\nto accompany him next night, and take that duty alternately with the\nphysician.\n\nAbout midnight, they reached the place, where they found the sexton in\nwaiting, according to the orders he had received. The door was opened,\nthe mourner conducted to the tomb, and left, as before, to the gloom of\nhis own meditations. Again he laid himself on the cold ground; again he\nrenewed his lamentable strain; his imagination began to be heated into\nan ecstasy of enthusiasm, during which he again fervently invoked the\nspirit of his deceased Monimia.\n\nIn the midst of these invocations, his ear was suddenly invaded with\nthe sound of some few solemn notes issuing from the organ, which seemed\nto feel the impulse of an invisible hand.\n\nAt this awful salutation, Melvil was roused to the keenest sense of\nsurprise and attention. Reason shrunk before the thronging ideas of his\nfancy, which represented this music as the prelude to something strange\nand supernatural; and, while he waited for the sequel, the place was\nsuddenly illuminated, and each surrounding object brought under the\ncognisance of his eye.\n\nWhat passed within his mind on this occasion is not easy to be\ndescribed. All his faculties were swallowed up by those of seeing and\nhearing. He had mechanically raised himself upon one knee, with his\nbody advancing forwards; and in this attitude he gazed with a look\nthrough which his soul seemed eager to escape. To his view, thus\nstrained upon vacant space, in a few minutes appeared the figure of a\nwoman arrayed in white, with a veil that covered her face, and flowed\ndown upon her back and shoulders. The phantom approached him with an\neasy step, and, lifting up her veil, discovered (believe it, O reader!)\nthe individual countenance of Monimia.\n\nAt sight of these well-known features, seemingly improved with new\ncelestial graces, the youth became a statue, expressing amazement,\nlove, and awful adoration. He saw the apparition smile with meek\nbenevolence, divine compassion, warm and intendered by that fond pure\nflame which death could not extinguish. He heard the voice of his\nMonimia call Renaldo! Thrice he essayed to answer; as oft his tongue\ndenied its office. His hair stood upright, and a cold vapour seemed to\nthrill through every nerve. This was not fear, but the infirmity of\nhuman nature, oppressed by the presence of a superior being.\n\nAt length his agony was overcome. He recollected all his resolution,\nand, in a strain of awestruck rapture, thus addressed the heavenly\nvisitant: “Hast thou then heard, pure spirit! the wailings of my grief?\nhast thou descended from the realms of bliss, in pity to my woe? and\nart thou come to speak the words of peace to my desponding soul? To bid\nthe wretched smile, to lift the load of misery and care from the\nafflicted breast; to fill thy lover’s heart with joy and pleasing hope,\nwas still the darling task of my Monimia, ere yet refined to that\nperfection which mortality can never attain. No wonder then, blessed\nshade, that now, when reunited to thy native heaven, thou art still\nkind, propitious, and beneficent to us, who groan in this inhospitable\nvale of sorrow thou hast left. Tell me, ah! tell me, dost thou still\nremember those fond hours we passed together? Doth that enlightened\nbosom feel a pang of soft regret, when thou recallest our fatal\nseparation? Sure that meekened glance bespeaks thy sympathy! Ah! how\nthat tender look o’erpowers me! Sacred Heaven! the pearly drops of pity\ntrickle down thy cheeks! Such are the tears that angels shed o’er man’s\ndistress!—Turn not away—Thou beckonest me to follow. Yes, I will follow\nthee, ethereal spirit, as far as these weak limbs, encumbered with\nmortality, will bear my weight; and, would to Heaven! I could, with\nease, put off these vile corporeal shackles, and attend thy flight.”\n\nSo saying, he started from the ground, and, in a transport of eager\nexpectation, at awful distance, traced the footsteps of the apparition,\nwhich, entering a detached apartment, sunk down upon a chair, and with\na sigh exclaimed, “Indeed, this is too much!” What was the disorder of\nRenaldo’s mind, when he perceived this phenomenon! Before reflection\ncould perform its office, moved by a sudden impulse, he sprung\nforwards, crying, “If it be death to touch thee, let me die!” and\ncaught in his arms, not the shadow, but the warm substance of the\nall-accomplished Monimia. “Mysterious powers of Providence! this is no\nphantom! this is no shade! this is the life! the panting bosom of her\nwhom I have so long, so bitterly deplored! I fold her in my arms! I\npress her glowing breast to mine! I see her blush with virtuous\npleasure and ingenuous love! She smiles upon me with enchanting\ntenderness! O let me gaze on that transcendent beauty, which, the more\nI view it, ravishes the more! These charms are too intense; I sicken\nwhile I gaze! Merciful Heaven! is not this a mere illusion of the\nbrain? Was she not fled for ever? Had not the cold hand of death\ndivorced her from my hope? This must be some flattering vision of my\ndistempered fancy! perhaps some soothing dream— If such it be, grant, O\nye heavenly powers! that I may never wake.”\n\n“O gentle youth!” replied the beauteous orphan, still clasped in his\nembrace, “what joy now fills the bosom of Monimia, at this triumph of\nthy virtue and thy love? When I see these transports of thy affection,\nwhen I find thee restored to that place in my esteem and admiration,\nwhich thou hadst lost by the arts of calumny and malice—this is a\nmeeting which my most sanguine hopes durst not presage!”\n\nSo entirely were the faculties of Renaldo engrossed in the\ncontemplation of his restored Monimia, that he saw not the rest of the\ncompany, who wept with transport over this affecting scene. He was\ntherefore amazed at the interposition of Madam Clement, who, while the\nshower of sympathetic pleasure bedewed her cheeks, congratulated the\nlovers upon this happy event, crying, “These are the joys which virtue\ncalls her own.” They also received the compliments of a reverend\nclergyman, who told Monimia, she had reaped, at last, the fruits of\nthat pious resignation to the will of Heaven, which she had so devoutly\npractised during the term of her affliction. And, lastly, they were\naccosted by the physician, who was not quite so hackneyed in the ways\nof death, or so callous to the finer sensations of the soul, but that\nhe blubbered plentifully, wile he petitioned Heaven in behalf of such\nan accomplished and deserving pair.\n\nMonimia taking Madam Clement by the hand, “Whatever joy,” said she,\n“Renaldo derives from this occasion, is owing to the bounty, the\ncompassion, and maternal care of this incomparable lady, together with\nthe kind admonitions and humanity of those two worthy gentlemen.”\n\nMelvil, whose passions were still in agitation, and whose mind could\nnot yet digest the incidents that occurred, embraced them all by turns;\nbut, like the faithful needle, which, though shaken for an instant from\nits poise, immediately regains its true direction, and points\ninvariably to the pole, he soon returned to his Monimia; again he held\nher in his arms, again he drank enchantment from her eyes, and thus\npoured forth the effusions of his soul:—“Can I then trust the evidence\nof sense? And art thou really to my wish restored? Never, O never did\nthy beauty shine with such bewitching grace, as that which now\nconfounds and captivates my view! Sure there is something more than\nmortal in thy looks!—Where hast thou lived?—where borrowed this\nperfection?—whence art thou now descended?—Oh! I am all amazement, joy,\nand fear!—Thou wilt not leave me!—No! we must not part again. By this\nwarm kiss! a thousand times more sweet than all the fragrance of the\nEast! we nevermore will part. O! this is rapture, ecstasy, and what no\nlanguage can explain!”\n\nIn the midst of these ejaculations, he ravished a banquet from her\nglowing lips, that kindled in his heart a flame which rushed through\nevery vein, and glided to his marrow. This was a privilege he had never\nclaimed before, and now permitted as a recompense for all the penance\nhe had suffered. Nevertheless, the cheeks of Monimia, who was\naltogether unaccustomed to such familiarities, underwent a total\nsuffusion; and Madam Clement discreetly relieved her from the anxiety\nof her situation, by interfering in the discourse, and rallying the\nCount upon his endeavours to monopolise such a branch of happiness.\n\n“O my dear lady!” replied Renaldo, who by this time had, in some\nmeasure, recovered his recollection, “forgive the wild transports of a\nfond lover, who hath so unexpectedly retrieved the jewel of his soul!\nYet, far from wishing to hoard up his treasure, he means to communicate\nand diffuse his happiness to all his friends. O my Monimia! how will\nthe pleasure of this hour be propagated! As yet thou knowest not all\nthe bliss that is reserved for thy enjoyment!—Meanwhile, I long to\nlearn by what contrivance this happy interview hath been effected.\nStill am I ignorant how I was transported into this apartment, from the\nlonely vault in which I mourned over my supposed misfortune!”\n\nCHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR\n\nTHE MYSTERY UNFOLDED—ANOTHER RECOGNITION, WHICH, IT IS TO BE HOPED, THE\nREADER COULD NOT FORESEE.\n\nThe French lady then explained the whole mystery of Monimia’s death, as\na stratagem she had concerted with the clergyman and doctor, in order\nto defeat the pernicious designs of Fathom, who seemed determined to\nsupport his false pretensions by dint of perjury and fraud, which they\nwould have found it very difficult to elude. She observed, that the\nphysician had actually despaired of Monimia’s life, and it was not till\nafter she herself was made acquainted with the prognostic, that she\nwrote the letter to Renaldo, which she committed to the care of Madam\nClement, with an earnest entreaty, that it should not be sent till\nafter her decease. But that lady, believing the Count had been\ncertainly abused by his treacherous confidant, despatched the billet\nwithout the knowledge of Monimia, whose health was restored by the\nindefatigable care of the physician, and the sage exhortations of the\nclergyman, by which she was reconciled to life. In a word, the villany\nof Fathom had inspired her with some faint hope that Renaldo might\nstill be innocent; and that notion contributed not a little to her\ncure.\n\nThe letter having so effectually answered their warmest hopes, in\nbringing back Renaldo such a pattern of constancy and love, the\nconfederates, in consequence of his enthusiastic sorrow, had planned\nthis meeting, as the most interesting way of restoring two virtuous\nlovers to the arms of each other; for which purpose the good clergyman\nhad pitched upon his own church, and indulged them with the use of the\nvestry, in which they now were presented with a small but elegant\ncollation.\n\nMelvil heard this succinct detail with equal joy and admiration. He\npoured forth the dictates of his gratitude to the preservers of his\nhappiness.—“This church,” said he, “shall henceforth possess a double\nshare of my veneration; this holy man will, I hope, finish the\ncharitable work he has begun, by tying those bands of our happiness,\nwhich nought but death shall have power to unbind.” Then turning to\nthat object which was the star of his regard, “Do I not overrate,” said\nhe, “my interest with the fair Monimia?” She made no verbal reply; but\nanswered by an emphatic glance, more eloquent than all the power of\nrhetoric and speech. This language, which is universal in the world of\nlove, he perfectly well understood, and, in token of that faculty,\nsealed the assent which she had smiled, with a kiss imprinted on her\npolished forehead.\n\nIn order to dissipate these interesting ideas, which, by being too long\nindulged, might have endangered his reason, Madam Clement entreated him\nto entertain the company with a detail of what had happened to him in\nhis last journey to the empire, and Monimia expressed a desire of\nknowing, in particular, the issue of his contest with Count Trebasi,\nwho, she knew, had usurped the succession of his father.\n\nThus solicited, he could not refuse to gratify their curiosity and\nconcern. He explained his obligations to the benevolent Jew; related\nthe steps he had taken at Vienna for the recovery of his inheritance;\ninformed them of his happy rencontre with his father-in-law; of his\nsister’s deliverance, and marriage; of the danger into which his life\nhad been precipitated by the news of Monimia’s death; and, lastly, of\nhis adventure with the banditti, in favour of a gentleman, who, he\nafterwards understood, had been robbed in the most base and barbarous\nmanner by Fathom. He likewise, to the astonishment of all present, and\nof his mistress in particular, communicated some circumstances, which\nshall appear in due season.\n\nMonimia’s tender frame being quite fatigued with the scene she had\nacted, and her mind overwhelmed with the prosperous tidings she had\nheard, after having joined the congratulations of the company, on the\ngood fortune of her Renaldo, begged leave to retire, that she might by\nrepose recruit her exhausted spirits; and the night being pretty far\nspent, she was conducted by her lover to Madam Clement’s coach, that\nstood in waiting, in which also the rest of the company made shift to\nembark, and were carried to the house of that good lady, where, after\nthey were invited to dine, and Melvil entreated to bring Don Diego and\nthe Jew along with them, they took leave of one another, and retired to\ntheir respective lodgings in a transport of joy and satisfaction.\n\nAs for Renaldo, his rapture was still mixed with apprehension, that all\nhe had seen and heard was no more than an unsubstantial vision, raised\nby some gay delirium of a disordered imagination. While his breast\nunderwent those violent, though blissful emotions of joy and\nadmiration, his friend the Castilian spent the night in ruminating over\nhis own calamities, and in a serious and severe review of his own\nconduct. He compared his own behaviour with that of the young\nHungarian, and found himself so light in the scale, that he smote his\nbreast with violence, exclaiming in an agony of remorse:\n\n“Count Melvil has reason to grieve; Don Diego to despair. His\nmisfortunes flow from the villany of mankind; mine are the fruit of my\nown madness. He laments the loss of a mistress, who fell a sacrifice to\nthe perfidious arts of a crafty traitor. She was beautiful, virtuous,\naccomplished, and affectionate; he was fraught with sensibility and\nlove. Doubtless his heart must have deeply suffered; his behaviour\ndenotes the keenness of his woe; his eyes are everflowing fountains of\ntears; his bosom the habitation of sighs; five hundred leagues hath he\nmeasured in a pilgrimage to her tomb; nightly he visits the dreary\nvault where she now lies at rest; her solitary grave is his couch; he\nconverses with darkness and the dead, until each lonely aisle re-echoes\nhis distress. What would be his penance, had he my cause! were he\nconscious of having murdered a beloved wife and darling daughter! Ah\nwretch!—ah cruel homicide!—what had those dear victims done to merit\nsuch a fate? Were they not ever gentle and obedient, ever aiming to\ngive thee satisfaction and delight? Say, that Serafina was enamoured of\na peasant; say, that she had degenerated from the honour of her race.\nThe inclinations are involuntary; perhaps that stranger was her equal\nin pedigree and worth. Had they been fairly questioned, they might have\njustified, at least excused, that conduct which appeared so criminal;\nor had they owned the offence, and supplicated pardon—O barbarous\nmonster that I am! was all the husband—was all the father extinguished\nin my heart? How shall my own errors be forgiven, if I refused to\npardon the frailties of my own blood—of those who are most dear to my\naffection? Yet nature pleaded strongly in their behalf!—My heart was\nbursting while I dismissed them to the shades of death. I was maddened\nwith revenge! I was guided by that savage principle which falsely we\ncall honour.\n\n“Accursed phantom! that assumes the specious title, and misleads our\nwretched nation! Is it then honourable to skulk like an assassin, and\nplunge the secret dagger in the heart of some unhappy man, who hath\nincurred my groundless jealousy or suspicion, without indulging him\nwith that opportunity which the worst criminal enjoys? Or is it\nhonourable to poison two defenceless women, a tender wife, an amiable\ndaughter, whom even a frown would almost have destroyed?—O! this is\ncowardice, brutality, hell-born fury and revenge! Heaven hath not mercy\nto forgive such execrable guilt. Who gave thee power, abandoned\nruffian! over the lives of those whom God hath stationed as thy fellows\nof probation;—over those whom he had sent to comfort and assist thee;\nto sweeten all thy cares, and smooth the rough uneven paths of life? O!\nI am doomed to never-ceasing horror and remorse! If misery can atone\nfor such enormous guilt, I have felt it in the extreme. Like an undying\nvulture it preys upon my heart;—to sorrow I am wedded; I hug that\nteeming consort to my soul;—never, ah! never shall we part; for soon as\nmy fame shall shine unclouded by the charge of treason that now hangs\nover it, I will devote myself to penitence and woe. A cold, damp\npavement shall be my bed; my raiment shall be sackcloth; the fields\nshall furnish herbage for my food; the stream shall quench my thirst;\nthe minutes shall be numbered by my groans; the night be privy to my\nstrains of sorrow, till Heaven, in pity to my sufferings, release me\nfrom the penance I endure. Perhaps the saints whom I have murdered will\nintercede for my remission.”\n\nSuch was the exercise of grief, in which the hapless Castilian consumed\nthe night; he had not yet consigned himself to rest, when Renaldo\nentering his chamber, displayed such a gleam of wildness and rapture on\nhis countenance, as overwhelmed him with amazement; for, till that\nmoment, he had never seen his visage unobscured with woe. “Pardon this\nabrupt intrusion, my friend,” cried Melvil, “I could no longer withhold\nfrom your participation, the great, the unexpected turn, which hath\nthis night dispelled all my sorrows, and restored me to the fruition of\nineffable joy. Monimia lives!—the fair, the tender, the virtuous\nMonimia lives, and smiles upon my vows! This night I retrieved her from\nthe grave. I held her in these arms; I pressed her warm delicious lips\nto mine! Oh, I am giddy with intolerable pleasure!”\n\nDon Diego was confounded at this declaration, which he considered as\nthe effects of a disordered brain. He never doubted that Renaldo’s\ngrief had at length overpowered his reason, and that his words were the\neffects of mere frenzy. While he mused on this melancholy subject, the\nCount composed his features, and, in a succinct and well-connected\ndetail, explained the whole mystery of his happiness, to the\ninexpressible astonishment of the Spaniard, who shed tears of\nsatisfaction, and straining the Hungarian to his breast, “O my son,”\nsaid he, “you see what recompense Heaven hath in store for those who\npursue the paths of real virtue; those paths from which I myself have\nbeen fatally misled by a faithless vapour, which hath seduced my steps,\nand left me darkling in the abyss of wretchedness. Such as you describe\nthis happy fair, was once my Serafina, rich in every grace of mind and\nbody which nature could bestow. Had it pleased Heaven to bless her with\na lover like Renaldo! but no more, the irrevocable shaft is fled. I\nwill not taint your enjoyment with my unavailing sighs!”\n\nMelvil assured this disconsolate father, that no pleasure, no avocation\nshould ever so entirely engross his mind, but that he should still find\nan hour for sympathy and friendship. He communicated the invitation of\nMadam Clement, and insisted upon his compliance, that he might have an\nopportunity of seeing and approving the object of his passion. “I can\nrefuse nothing to the request of Count de Melvil,” replied the\nSpaniard, “and it were ungrateful in me to decline the honour you\npropose. I own myself inflamed with a desire of beholding a young lady,\nwhose perfections I have seen reflected in your sorrow; my curiosity\nis, moreover, interested on account of that humane gentlewoman, whose\nuncommon generosity sheltered such virtue in distress; but my\ndisposition is infectious, and will, I am afraid, hang like a damp upon\nthe general festivity of your friends.”\n\nMelvil would take no denial, and having obtained his consent, repaired\nto the house of Joshua, whose countenance seemed to unbend gradually\ninto a total expression of joy and surprise, as he learned the\ncircumstances of this amazing event. He faithfully promised to attend\nthe Count at the appointed hour, and, in the meantime, earnestly\nexhorted him to take some repose, in order to quiet the agitation of\nhis spirits, which must have been violently hurried on this occasion.\nThe advice was salutary, and Renaldo resolved to follow it.\n\nHe returned to his lodgings, and laid himself down; but,\nnotwithstanding the fatigue he had undergone, sleep refused to visit\nhis eyelids, all his faculties being kept in motion by the ideas that\ncrowded so fast upon his imagination. Nevertheless, though his mind\ncontinued in agitation, his body was refreshed, and he arose in the\nforenoon with more serenity and vigour than he had enjoyed for many\nmonths. Every moment his heart throbbed with new rapture, when he found\nhimself on the brink of possessing all that his soul held dear and\namiable; he put on his gayest looks and apparel; insisted upon the\nCastilian’s doing the same honour to the occasion; and the alteration\nof dress produced such an advantageous change in the appearance of Don\nDiego, that when Joshua arrived at the appointed hour, he could scarce\nrecognise his features, and complimented him very politely on the\nimprovement of his looks.\n\nTrue it is, the Spaniard was a personage of a very prepossessing mien\nand noble deportment; and had not grief, by increasing his native\ngravity, in some measure discomposed the symmetry of his countenance,\nhe would have passed for a man of a very amiable and engaging\nphysiognomy. They set out in the Jew’s coach for the house of Madam\nClement, and were ushered into an apartment, where they found the\nclergyman and physician with that lady, to whom Don Diego and the\nHebrew were by Melvil introduced.\n\nBefore they had seated themselves, Renaldo inquired about the health of\nMonimia, and was directed to the next room by Madam Clement, who\npermitted him to go thither, and conduct her to the company. He was not\nslow of availing himself of this permission. He disappeared in an\ninstant, and, during his short absence, Don Diego was strangely\ndisturbed The blood flushed and forsook his cheeks by turns; a cold\nvapour seemed to shiver through his nerves; and at his breast he felt\nuncommon palpitation. Madam Clement observed his discomposure, and\nkindly inquired into the cause; when he replied, “I have such an\ninterest in what concerns the Count de Melvil, and my imagination is so\nmuch prepossessed with the perfections of Monimia, that I am, as it\nwere, agonised with expectation; yet never did my curiosity before\nraise such tumults as those that now agitate my bosom.”\n\nHe had scarce pronounced these words, when the door, reopening, Renaldo\nled in this mirror of elegance and beauty, at sight of whom the\nIsraelite’s countenance was distorted into a stare of admiration. But\nif such was the astonishment of Joshua, what were the emotions of the\nCastilian, when, in the beauteous orphan, he beheld the individual\nfeatures of his long-lost Serafina!\n\nHis feelings are not to be described. The fond parent, whose affection\nshoots even to a sense of pain, feels not half such transport, when he\nunexpectedly retrieves a darling child from the engulfing billows or\ndevouring flame. The hope of Zelos had been totally extinguished. His\nheart had been incessantly torn with anguish and remorse, upbraiding\nhim as the murderer of Serafina. His, therefore, were the additional\ntransports of a father disburdened of the guilt of such enormous\nhomicide. His nerves were too much overpowered by this sudden\nrecognition, to manifest the sensation of his soul by external signs.\nHe started not, nor did he lift an hand in token of surprise; he moved\nnot from the spot on which he stood; but, riveting his eyes to those of\nthe lovely phantom, remained without motion, until she, approaching\nwith her lover, fell at his feet, and clasping his knees, exclaimed,\n“May I yet call you father?”\n\nThis powerful shock aroused his faculties; a cold sweat bedewed his\nforehead; his knees began to totter; he dropped upon the floor, and\nthrowing his arms around her, cried, “O nature! O Serafina! Merciful\nProvidence! thy ways are past finding out.” So saying, he fell upon her\nneck, and wept aloud. The tears of sympathetic joy trickled down her\nsnowy bosom, that heaved with rapture inexpressible. Renaldo’s eyes\npoured forth the briny stream. The cheeks of Madam Clement were not dry\nin this conjuncture; she kneeled by Serafina, kissed her with all the\neagerness of maternal affection, and with uplifted hands adored the\nPower that preordained this blessed event. The clergyman and doctor\nintimately shared the general transport; and as for Joshua, the drops\nof true benevolence flowed from his eyes, like the oil on Aaron’s\nbeard, while he skipped about the room in an awkward ecstasy, and in a\nvoice resembling the hoarse notes of the long-eared tribe, cried, “O\nfather Abraham! such a moving scene hath not been acted since Joseph\ndisclosed himself unto his brethren in Egypt.”\n\nDon Diego having found utterance to his passion, proceeded in this\nstrain: “O my dear child! to find thee thus again, after our last\nunhappy parting, is wonderful! miraculous! Blessed be the all-good, my\nconscience. I am not then the dire assassin, who sacrificed his wife\nand daughter to an infernal motive, falsely titled honour? though I am\nmore and more involved in a mystery, which I long to hear explained.”\n\n“That shall be my task,” cried Renaldo, “but first permit me to implore\nyour sanction to my passion for the incomparable Serafina. You already\nknow our mutual sentiments; and though I own the possession of such\ninestimable worth and beauty would be a recompense that infinitely\ntranscends the merit I can plead, yet, as it hath been my good fortune\nto inspire her with a mutual flame, I hope to reap from your indulgence\nhere, what I could not expect from my own desert; and we present\nourselves, in hope of your paternal assent and benediction.”\n\n“Were she more fair and good and gentle than she is,” answered the\nCastilian, “and to my partial observation nought e’er appeared on earth\nmore beauteous and engaging, I would approve your title to her heart,\nand recommend you to her smiles, with all a father’s influence and\npower. Yes, my daughter! my joy on this occasion is infinitely\naugmented by the knowledge of those tender ties of love that bind thee\nto this amiable youth; a youth to whose uncommon courage and generosity\nI owe my life and my subsistence, together with the inexpressible\ndelight that now revels in my bosom. Enjoy, my children, the happy\nfruits of your reciprocal attachment. May Heaven, which hath graciously\nconducted you through a labyrinth of perplexity and woe, to this\ntransporting view of blissful days, indulge you with that uninterrupted\nstream of pure felicity, which is the hope, and ought to be the boon of\nvirtue, such as yours!”\n\nSo saying, he joined their hands, and embraced them with the most\ncordial love and satisfaction, which diffused itself to every\nindividual of the company, who fervently invoked the Almighty Power, in\nbehalf of this enraptured pair. The tumult of these emotions having a\nlittle subsided, and the Castilian being seated betwixt Renaldo and his\nbeauteous bride, he politely bespoke the indulgence of Madam Clement,\nbegging she would permit him to demand the performance of the Count’s\npromise, that he might be forthwith made acquainted with those\ncircumstances of his own fate which he was so impatient to learn.\n\nThe lady having assured him, that she and all the company would take\npleasure in hearing the recapitulation, the Spaniard, addressing\nhimself to Melvil, “In the name of Heaven!” said he, “how could you\nsupplant that rival, who fell a sacrifice to my resentment, after he\nhad bewitched the heart of Serafina? for, sure, the affection he had\nkindled in her breast must have long survived his death,” “That rival,”\nreplied the Count, “who incurred your displeasure, was no other than\nRenaldo.” With these words, he applied to one eye a patch of black silk\nprovided for the purpose, and turning his face towards Don Diego, that\ngentleman started with astonishment, crying, “Good Heaven! the very\ncountenance of Orlando, whom I slew! this is still more amazing!”\n\nCHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE\n\nA RETROSPECTIVE LINK, NECESSARY FOR THE CONCATENATION OF THESE MEMOIRS.\n\n“Indulge me with a patient hearing,” proceeded the Hungarian, “and all\nthese riddles soon will be explained. Inflamed with the desire of\nseeing foreign countries, I disobeyed the will of an indulgent father,\nfrom whose house, withdrawing privately, I set out for Italy, in\ndisguise, by the way of Tyrol, visited Venice, Rome, Florence, and,\nembarking at Naples, in an English ship, arrived at St. Lucar, from\nwhence I repaired to Seville; there, in a few days, was my curiosity\nengaged by the fame of the fair Serafina, who was justly deemed the\nmost accomplished beauty in that part of Spain. Nay, blush not, gentle\ncreature! for by my hopes of heaven! thy charms were even injured by\nthe cold applause of that report. Nevertheless, I was warmly interested\nby the uncommon character, and eagerly longed to see this pattern of\nperfection. As Don Diego did not train her up in that restraint to\nwhich the Spanish ladies are subjected, I soon found an opportunity of\nseeing her at church; and no person here present will, I presume, doubt\nbut that I was instantly captivated by her beauty and deportment. Had I\nthought that Don Diego’s favour was unengaged, perhaps I should have\nfollowed the dictates of vanity and inexperience, and presented myself\nin my own character, among the crowd of her professed admirers. I knew\nher father had been an officer of distinguished rank and reputation,\nand did not doubt that he would have regarded a young soldier of\nunexceptionable pedigree, and, I will even add, of untainted fame. Nor\ndid I suppose my own father could have objected against such an\nadvantageous match; but, by dint of industrious inquiry, I learned,\nthat the divine Serafina was already betrothed to Don Manuel de\nMendoza, and this information overwhelmed me with despair.\n\n“After having revolved a thousand projects for retarding and preventing\nthat detested union, I resolved to avail myself of my talent for\ndrawing, and professed myself a master of that science, in hope of\nbeing employed by the father of Serafina, who, I knew, let slip no\nopportunity of improving his daughter’s education. Accordingly I had\nthe good fortune to attract his notice, was invited to his house,\nhonoured with his approbation, and furnished with unrestricted\nopportunities of conversing with the dear object of my love. The\npassion which her beauty had kindled was by the perfections of her mind\ninflamed to such a degree of transport, as could not be concealed from\nher penetration. She chanced to relish my conversation; I gradually\nacquired her friendship; pity was the next passion that she entertained\nin my favour. I then ventured to disclose myself, and the dear charmer\ndid not disapprove of my presumption. She and her mother had been\nperplexed with some religious scruples, concerning which they appealed\nto my opinion; and I was happy enough to set their minds at ease.\n\n“This sort of intercourse naturally created a mutual confidence among\nus; and, in a word, I was blessed with the daughter’s love and mother’s\napprobation. Don Diego will pardon these clandestine measures, which we\ntook, from a full persuasion that it was impossible to render him\npropitious to the views in which our hearts and hands were so deeply\ninterested. I did not then know how little he was addicted to\nsuperstition.\n\n“Without entering into a detail of the schemes we projected to delay\nthe happiness of Mendoza, I shall only observe, that, knowing the fatal\nday was at length unalterably fixed, we determined to elude the purpose\nof Don Diego by flight; and everything was actually prepared for our\nescape. When the hour of appointment arrived, I repaired to the place\nat which I had proposed to enter the house, and stumbled, in the dark,\nover the body of a man still warm, and bleeding. Alarmed at this\noccurrence, I darted myself through the window, and rushing to the\napartment of the ladies, (immortal powers!) beheld the peerless\nSerafina, and her virtuous mother, stretched on a couch, and, in all\nappearance, deprived of life.\n\n“The company will easily conceive what agonies I felt at such a\nspectacle! I ran towards the spot in a transport of horror! I clasped\nmy lovely mistress in my arms, and, finding her still breathing,\nendeavoured, but in vain, to wake her from the trance Antonia was\noverwhelmed with the same lethargic power. My fancy was immediately\nstruck with the apprehension of their being poisoned. Regardless of my\nown situation, I alarmed the family, called for assistance, and\nrequested the servants to summon Don Diego to the dismal scene. I was\ninformed that their master had rode forth in manifest confusion; and\nwhile I pondered on this surprising excursion, an apothecary in the\nneighbourhood entered the chamber, and having examined the pulses of\nthe ladies, declared that their lives were in no danger, and advised\nthat they should be undressed, and conveyed to bed. While their women\nwere busied in this employment, I went into the court-yard, attended by\nsome of the servants with lights, in order to view the body of the man\nwhich I had found at my arrival. His apparel was mean, his countenance\nferocious; a long spado was buckled to his thigh, and, in his belt,\nwere stuck a brace of loaded pistols; so that we concluded he was some\nthief, who had waited for an opportunity, and seeing the casement open,\nintended to rob the house, but was prevented, and slain by Don Diego\nhimself, whose retreat, however, did not a little confound our\nconjecture. For my own part, I remained all night in the house,\ntortured with fear, vexation, and suspense.\n\n“My hope was altogether disappointed by this unhappy accident; and I\nshuddered at the prospect of losing Serafina for ever, either by this\nmysterious malady, or by her marriage with Mendoza, which I now\ndespaired of being able to defeat. The major-domo having waited several\nhours for his lord’s return, without seeing him appear, thought proper\nto despatch a messenger to Don Manuel, with an account of what had\nhappened; and that nobleman arriving in the morning, took possession of\nthe house. About four o’clock in the afternoon, Serafina began to stir,\nand, at five, she and her mother were perfectly awake.\n\n“They no sooner recovered the use of reflection, than they gave signs\nof equal sorrow and amazement, and earnestly called for Isabella, who\nwas privy to our design, and who, after a very minute inquiry, was\nfound in a lone and solitary chamber, where she had been confined. Such\nwas the confusion of the house, that no person ever dreamed of asking\nhow I entered, each domestic, in all probability, supposing I had been\nintroduced by his fellow; so that I tarried unquestioned, on pretence\nof concern for the distress of a family in which I had been so\ngenerously entertained, and, by Isabella, sent my respects and duty to\nher ladies. She was, therefore, not a little surprised, when, after\nevery other servant had withdrawn, she heard the lovely Serafina\nexclaim, with all the violence of grief, ‘Ah! Isabella, Orlando is no\nmore!’ But their astonishment was still greater, when she assured them\nof my being alive, and in the house. They recounted to her the\nadventure of last night, which she explained, by informing them of the\nletters which Don Diego had intercepted. And they immediately\nconcluded, that he had, in the precipitation of his wrath, killed, by\nmistake, the person who was found dead in the court-yard. This\nconjecture alarmed them on my account; they, by the medium of Isabella,\nconjured me to leave the house, lest Don Diego should return, and\naccomplish his resentment; and I was persuaded to withdraw, after I had\nsettled the channel of a correspondence with the confidant.\n\n“Being now obliged to alter our measures, because our former intention\nwas discovered by Don Diego, I secured a retreat for Serafina and her\nmother, at the house of the English consul in Seville, who was my\nparticular friend; and, next day, understanding from Isabella that her\nlord had not yet reappeared, and that Don Manuel was very urgent in his\naddresses, we concerted an assignation in the garden, and that same\nevening I was fortunate enough to convey my prize to the asylum I had\nprepared for their reception. Inexpressible was the rage of Mendoza,\nwhen he heard of their elopement. He raved like one deprived of\nreason—swore he would put all the servants of the family to the\nrack—and, in consequence of the intelligence he obtained by threats and\npromises, set on foot a very strict inquiry, in order to apprehend the\nfugitives and Orlando, who had by some means or other incurred his\nsuspicion.\n\n“We eluded his search by the vigilance and caution of our kind host;\nand, while we remained in concealment, were extremely astonished to\nhear that the unfortunate Don Diego was proclaimed a traitor, and a\nprice set upon his head. This information overwhelmed us all with the\nutmost affliction. Antonia lamented, without ceasing, the disgrace of\nher beloved lord, from whom she never would have withdrawn herself, but\nwith the lively hope of a reconciliation, after the first transports of\nhis ire should have subsided, and the real character of Orlando should\nhave appeared. It was not long before we had reason to believe that\nMendoza was the accuser of Don Diego—\n\n“Nay, start not, Signior; Manuel was actually that traitor! This was\nthe turn of his revenge! when he found himself disappointed in the hope\nof possessing the incomparable Serafina, he took a base advantage of\nyour absence and retreat. He posted to Madrid, impeached you to the\nsecretary of state of having maintained a criminal correspondence with\nthe enemies of Spain, included me in his accusation, as a spy for the\nhouse of Austria, and framed such a plausible tale, from the\ncircumstances of your distress, that Don Diego was outlawed, and\nMendoza gratified with a grant of his estate.\n\n“These melancholy incidents made a deep impression upon the mind of the\nvirtuous Antonia, who waiving every other consideration, would have\npersonally appeared for the vindication of her husband’s honour, had\nnot we dissuaded her from such a rash undertaking, by demonstrating her\ninability to contend with such a powerful antagonist; and representing\nthat her appearance would be infallibly attended with the ruin of\nSerafina, who would certainly fall into the hands of the villain to\nwhom she had been contracted. We exhorted her to wait patiently for\nsome happy revolution of fortune, and encouraged her with the hope of\nDon Diego’s exerting himself effectually in his own defence.\n\n“Meanwhile our worthy landlord was suddenly cut off by death; and his\nwidow being resolved to retire into her own country, we secretly\nembarked in the same ship, and arrived in England about eighteen months\nago. Antonia still continued to pine over the ruin of her house; as she\ncould hear no tidings of Don Diego, she concluded he was dead, and\nmourned with unabating sorrow. In vain I assured her, that, soon as my\nown affairs should be adjusted, I would exert my whole endeavours to\nfind and succour him. She could not imagine that a man of his spirit\nand disposition would live so long in obscurity. And her affliction\nderived new force from the death of the consul’s widow, with whom she\nhad lived in the most unbounded intimacy and friendship. From that day,\nher health evidently declined. She foresaw her dissolution, and\ncomforted herself with the hope of seeing her husband and her friend in\na place where no treachery is felt, and no sorrow is known; confident\nof my integrity, and the purity of my love, she, in the most pathetic\nterms, recommended Serafina to my care.\n\n“Ha! weepest thou, fair excellence, at the remembrance of that tender\nscene, when the good Antonia, on the bed of death, joined thy soft hand\nto mine, and said, ‘Renaldo, I bequeath this orphan to your love; it is\na sacred pledge, which, if you cherish with due honour and regard,\ninternal peace and happiness will ever smile within your bosom; but if\nyou treat it with indifference, dishonour, or neglect, just Heaven will\npunish your breach of trust with everlasting disappointments and\ndisquiet.’\n\n“Signior Don Diego, I see you are moved, and therefore will not dwell\non such distressful circumstances. The excellent Antonia exchanged this\nlife for a more happy state; and so exquisite was the sorrow of the\ntender-hearted Serafina, as to torture me with the apprehension that\nshe would not long survive her pious mother. How I obeyed the\ninjunctions of that departing saint, Monimia (for that name she now\nassumed) can testify, until that artful serpent Fathom glided into our\nmutual confidence, abused our ears, poisoned our unsuspected faith, and\neffected that fatal breach, productive of all the misery and vexation\nwhich we have suffered, and which is now so happily expelled.”\n\n“Heaven,” said the Castilian, “hath visited me for the sins and errors\nof my youth; yet, such mercy hath been mingled with its chastisements,\nI dare not murmur or repine. The tears of penitence and sorrow shall\nwater my Antonia’s grave; as for Mendoza, I rejoice at his treachery,\nby which the obligation of my promise is cancelled, and my honour fully\nacquitted. He shall not triumph in his guilt. My services, my\ncharacter, and innocence shall soon confront his perfidy, and, I hope,\ndefeat his interest. The King is just and gracious, nor is my family\nand name unknown.”\n\nHere the Jew interposing, presented to him a letter from a person of\nconsequence at Madrid, whom Joshua had interested in the cause of Don\nDiego; that nobleman had already found means to represent the case of\nZelos to his Majesty, who had actually ordered Don Manuel to be\nconfined, until the injured person should appear to justify himself,\nand prosecute his accuser according to the terms of law. At the same\ntime Don Diego was summoned to present himself before the King within a\nlimited time, to answer to the charge which Mendoza had brought against\nhim.\n\nThe Spaniard’s heart overflowed with gratitude and joy, when he read\nthis intimation; he embraced the Jew, who, before Zelos could give\nutterance to his thoughts, told him that the Spanish Ambassador at\nLondon, having been prepossessed in his favour, craved the honour of\nseeing Don Diego; and that he, Joshua, was ready to conduct him to the\nhouse.\n\n“Then is my heart at rest!” cried the Castilian; “the house of Zelos\nonce more shall lift up its head. I shall again revisit my native\ncountry with honour, and abase the villain who hath soiled my fame! O\nmy children! this day is replete with such joy and satisfaction, as I\ndid not think had been in the power of Heaven to grant, without the\ninterposition of a miracle! To you, Renaldo, to you illustrious lady,\nand to these worthy gentlemen, am I indebted for the restoration of\nthat for which alone I wish to live; and when my heart ceases to retain\nthe obligation, may I forfeit the name of a Castilian, and scorn and\ndishonour be my portion.”\n\nPerhaps all Europe could not produce another company so happy as that\nwhich now sat down to dinner in the house of Madam Clement, whose own\nbenevolent heart was peculiarly adapted for such enjoyment. The lovers\nfeasted their eyes more than their appetite, by a tender intercourse of\nglances, which needed not the slow interpretation of speech; while the\nSpaniard regarded them alternately with looks of wonder and paternal\njoy, and every individual surveyed the all-deserving pair with\nadmiration and esteem.\n\nSerafina taking the advantage of this general satisfaction, when the\nheart, softened into complacency, deposits every violent thought: “I\nmust now,” said she, “try my interest with Renaldo. The good company\nshall bear witness to my triumph or repulse. I do not ask you to\nforgive, but to withhold your vengeance from the wretched Fathom. His\nfraud, ingratitude, and villany are, I believe, unrivalled; yet his\nbase designs have been defeated; and Heaven perhaps hath made him the\ninvoluntary instrument for bringing our constancy and virtue to the\ntest; besides, his perfidy is already punished with the last degree of\nhuman misery and disgrace. The doctor, who has traced him in all his\nconduct and vicissitudes of fortune, will draw a picture of his present\nwretchedness, which, I doubt not, will move your compassion, as it hath\nalready excited mine.”\n\nThe generous hostess was ready to enforce this charitable proposal with\nall her eloquence, when Melvil, with a look that well expressed his\nmagnanimity of love, replied, “Such a boon becomes the gentle Serafina!\nO! every moment furnishes me with fresh matter to admire the virtues of\nthy soul. If thou, whose tender heart hath been so rent with misery and\nanguish, canst intercede for thy tormentor, who now suffers in his\nturn, shall I refuse to pardon the miserable wretch! No, let me glory\nin imitating the great example, and solicit Don Diego in behalf of the\nsame miscreant whose perfidious barbarity cost him such intolerable\nwoe.” “Enough,” cried the Castilian, “I have disclaimed the vindictive\nprinciples of a Spaniard; and leave the miserable object to the sting\nof his own conscience, which, soon or late, will not fail to avenge the\nwrongs we have sustained from his deceit.”\n\nCHAPTER SIXTY-SIX\n\nTHE HISTORY DRAWS NEAR A PERIOD.\n\nUniversal was the applause which they acquired by this noble sacrifice\nof their resentment. The afternoon was spent in the utmost harmony and\ngood-humour; and at the earnest solicitation of Renaldo, whose fancy\nstill harboured the apprehensions of another separation, Don Diego\nconsented that the indissoluble knot should be tied between that young\ngentleman and Serafina in two days, and the place appointed for the\nceremony was the very church where they had been restored to the arms\nof each other.\n\nThe lovely bride, with a silent blush that set her lover’s heart on\nfire, submitted to this determination, in consequence of which the\ncompany was bespoke for that auspicious hour, and the evening being\npretty far advanced, they took leave of the ladies, and retired to\ntheir respective homes; Don Diego and his future son-in-law being\nreconducted to their lodgings, in the coach of the Jew, who, taking an\nopportunity of being alone with Melvil, observed that it would be\nnecessary on this occasion to supply the Castilian with a sum of money,\nin order to support his dignity and independence, in furnishing\nSerafina with everything suitable to her rank and merit; and that he\nwould willingly accommodate him, provided he knew how to propose it so\nas to give no offence to his punctilious disposition.\n\nRenaldo, thanking him for this generous anticipation, advised him to\nsolicit the Spaniard’s correspondence in the way of business, and to\nput the whole on the footing of his own interest; by which means Don\nDiego’s delicacy could sustain no affront. Fraught with this\ninstruction, the Israelite desired a private audience of the Castilian,\nin which, after an apology for the freedom of his demand, “Signior Don\nDiego,” said he, “as your fortune hath been so long embezzled by your\nadversary in Spain, and your correspondence with that country entirely\ncut off, it is not to be supposed that your finances are at present in\nsuch a condition as to maintain the splendour of your family. Count de\nMelvil’s whole fortune is at your command; and had not he been afraid\nof giving umbrage to the peculiar delicacy of your sentiments, he would\nhave pressed you to use it for your convenience. For my own part, over\nand above the inclination I have to serve Don Diego, I consult my own\nprivate advantage in desiring you to accept my service on this\noccasion. Money is the chief commodity in which I deal, and, if you\nhonour me with your commands, I shall be a gainer by my obedience.”\n\nDon Diego replied, with a smile that denoted how well he understood the\nmeaning of this address, “Surely, Signior, I am bound by the strongest\nties to exert my utmost endeavours for your advantage; and I pray God\nthis your proposal may have that issue. I am well acquainted with the\nCount’s generosity and refined notions of honour; and too much obliged\nby him already, to hesitate with punctilious reserve in accepting his\nfuture assistance. Nevertheless, since you have contrived a scheme for\nremoving all scruples of that sort, I shall execute it with pleasure;\nand, in the form of business, you shall have all the security I can\ngive for what shall be necessary to answer my present occasions.”\n\nThe preliminaries being thus settled, Joshua advanced for his use a\nthousand pounds, for which he would take neither bond, note, nor\nreceipt, desiring only that the Castilian would mark it in his own\npocket-book, that the debt might appear, in case any accident should\nbefall the borrower. Although the Spaniard had been accustomed to the\nuncommon generosity of Melvil, he could not help wondering at this\nnobleness of behaviour, so little to be expected from any merchant,\nmuch less from a Jewish broker.\n\nWhile this affair was on the anvil, Renaldo, who could no longer\nwithhold the communication of his happiness from his sister and\nrelations in Germany, took up the pen, and, in a letter to his\nbrother-in-law, recounted all the circumstances of the surprising turn\nof fate which he had experienced since his arrival in England. He\nlikewise related the story of Don Diego, informed them of the day\nappointed for his nuptials, and entreated the Major to make a journey\nto London with his wife; or, if that should be impracticable, to come\nas far as Brussels, where they should be met by him and his Serafina.\nThere was now but one day between him and the accomplishment of his\ndearest wish, and that was spent in procuring a licence, and adjusting\nthe preparations for the grand festival. Don Diego in the forenoon\nvisited Madam Clement, to whom he repeated his warm acknowledgments of\nher bounty and maternal affection to his daughter, and presented to\nSerafina bank notes to the amount of five hundred pounds, to defray the\nnecessary expense for her wedding ornaments.\n\nAll the previous steps being taken for the solemnisation of this\ninteresting event, and the hour of appointment arrived, the bridegroom,\naccompanied by his father-in-law, hastened to the place of rendezvous,\nwhich was the vestry-room of the church we have already described;\nwhere they were received by the good clergyman in his canonicals; and\nhere they had not waited many minutes, when they were joined by Madam\nClement and the amiable bride, escorted by the friendly physician, who\nhad all along borne such a share in their concerns. Serafina was\ndressed in a sack of white satin, and the ornaments of her head were\nadjusted in the Spanish fashion, which gave a peculiar air to her\nappearance, and an additional spirit to those attractions which engaged\nthe heart of each beholder. There was nothing remarkable in the habit\nof Renaldo, who had copied the plainness and elegance of his mistress;\nbut, when she entered the place, his features were animated with a\ndouble proportion of vivacity, and their eyes meeting, seemed to kindle\na blaze which diffused warmth and joy through the countenances of all\npresent.\n\nAfter a short pause, her father led her to the altar, and gave her away\nto the transported Renaldo, before the priest who performed the\nceremony, and bestowed the nuptial benediction on this enraptured pair.\nThe sanction of the church being thus obtained, they withdrew into the\nvestry, where Melvil sealed his title on her rosy lips, and presented\nhis wife to the company, who embraced her in their turns, with fervent\nwishes for their mutual happiness.\n\nThough the scene of this transaction was remote from any inhabited\nneighbourhood, the church was surrounded by a crowd of people, who,\nwith uncommon demonstration of surprise and admiration, petitioned\nHeaven to bless so fair a couple. Such indeed was their eagerness to\nsee them, that some lives were endangered by the pressure of the crowd,\nwhich attended them with loud acclamations to the coach, after the\nbridegroom had deposited in the hands of the minister one hundred\npounds for the benefit of the poor of that parish, and thrown several\nhandfuls of money among the multitude. Serafina re-embarked in Madam\nClement’s convenience, with that good lady and Don Diego, while\nRenaldo, with the clergyman and doctor, followed in Joshua’s coach, to\na pleasant country-house upon the Thames, at a distance of a few miles\nfrom London. This the Jew had borrowed from the owner for a few days,\nand there they were received by that honest Hebrew, who had provided a\nvery elegant entertainment for the occasion. He had also bespoke a\nsmall but excellent band of music, which regaled their ears while they\nsat at dinner; and the afternoon being calm and serene, he prevailed on\nthem to take the air on the river, in a barge which he had prepared for\nthe purpose.\n\nBut, notwithstanding this diversity of amusement, Renaldo would have\nfound it the longest day he had ever passed, had not his imagination\nbeen diverted by an incident which employed his attention during the\nremaining part of the evening. They had drunk tea, and engaged in a\nparty at whist, when they were surprised with a noise of contention\nfrom a public-house, that fronted the windows of the apartment in which\nthey sat. Alarmed at this uproar, they forsook their cards, and,\nthrowing up the casement, beheld a hearse surrounded by four men on\nhorseback, who had stopped the carriage, and violently pulled the\ndriver from his seat. This uncommon arrest had engaged the curiosity of\nthe publican’s family, who stood at the door to observe the\nconsequence, when all of a sudden appeared a person in canonicals, well\nmounted, who, riding up to those who maltreated the driver, bestowed\nupon one of them such a blow with the butt-end of his whip, as laid him\nsprawling on the ground; and, springing from his saddle upon the box,\ntook the reins into his own hand, swearing with great vehemence, that\nhe would murder every man who should attempt to obstruct the hearse.\n\nThe good priest who had married Renaldo was not a little scandalised at\nthis ferocious behaviour in a clergyman, and could not help saying\naloud, he was a disgrace to the cloth when the horseman looking up to\nthe window, replied, “Sir, may I be d—n’d, if any man in England has a\ngreater respect for the cloth than I have; but at present I am quite\ndistracted.” So saying, he whipped up the horses, and had actually\ndisentangled the hearse from those who surrounded it, when he was\nopposed by another troop, one of whom alighted with great expedition,\nand cut the harness so as that he could not possibly proceed. Finding\nhimself thus driven to bay, he leaped upon the ground, and exercised\nhis weapon with such amazing strength and agility, that several of his\nantagonists were left motionless on the field, before he was\noverpowered and disarmed by dint of numbers, who assailed him on all\nsides.\n\nThe mad parson being thus taken prisoner, an elderly person, of a very\nprepossessing appearance, went up to the hearse, and, unbolting the\ndoor, a young lady sprung out, and shrieking, ran directly to the\npublic-house, to the infinite astonishment and affright of the whole\nfamily, who believed it was the spirit of the deceased person, whose\nbody lay in the carriage. Renaldo, who was with difficulty restrained\nfrom interposing in behalf of the clergyman against such odds, no\nsooner perceived this apparition, than, supposing her to be some\ndistressed damsel, his Quixotism awoke, he descended in an instant, and\nrushed into the house, among those that pursued the fair phantom. Don\nDiego and the physician took the same road, while the real clergyman\nand Joshua tarried with the ladies, who were, by this time, very much\ninterested in the event.\n\nMelvil found the young lady in the hands of the old gentleman, who had\nreleased her from the hearse, and who now bitterly upbraided her for\nher folly and disobedience; while she protested with great vivacity,\nthat whatever she might suffer from his severity, she would never\nsubmit to the hateful match he had proposed, nor break the promise she\nhad already made to the gentleman who now attempted to rescue her from\nthe tyranny of a cruel father. This declaration was followed by a\nplentiful shower of tears, which the father could not behold with\nunmoistened eyes, although he reviled her with marks of uncommon\ndispleasure; and turning to the Count, “I appeal to you, sir,” said he,\n“whether I have not reason to curse the undutiful obstinacy of that\npert baggage, and renounce her for ever as an alien to my blood. She\nhas, for some months, been solicited in marriage by an honest citizen,\na thirty thousand pound man; and instead of listening to such an\nadvantageous proposal, she hath bestowed her heart upon a young fellow\nnot worth a groat. Ah! you degenerate hussy, this comes of your plays\nand romances. If thy mother were not a woman of an unexceptionable life\nand conversation, I should verily believe thou art no child of mine.\nRun away with a beggar! for shame!”\n\n“I suppose,” replied Renaldo, “the person to whom your daughter’s\naffection inclines, is that clergyman who exerted himself so manfully\nat the door?” “Clergyman!” cried the other, “adad! he has more of the\ndevil than the church about him. A ruffian! he has, for aught I know,\nmurdered the worthy gentleman whom I intended for my son-in-law; and\nthe rogue, if I had not kept out of his way, would, I suppose, have\nserved me with the same sauce. Me! who have been his master for many\nyears, and had resolved to make a man of him. Sir, he was my own clerk,\nand this is the return I have met with from the serpent which I\ncherished in my bosom.”\n\nHere he was interrupted by the arrival of the citizen for whom he had\nexpressed such concern; that gentleman had received a contusion upon\none eye, by which the sight was altogether obstructed, so that he\nconcluded he should never retrieve the use of that organ, and with\ngreat clamour took all the spectators to witness the injury he had\nsustained; he entered the room with manifest perturbation, demanded\nsatisfaction of the father, and peremptorily declared it should not be\na lost eye to him if there was law in England. This unseasonable\ndemand, and the boisterous manner in which it was made, did not at all\nsuit the present humour of the old gentleman, who told him peevishly he\nowed him no eye, and bade him go and ask reparation of the person who\nhad done him wrong.\n\nThe young lady snatching this favourable occasion, earnestly entreated\nMelvil and his company to intercede with her father in behalf of her\nlover, who, she assured them, was a young gentleman of a good family,\nand uncommon merit; and in compliance with her request they invited him\nand his daughter to the house in which they lodged, where they would be\ndisencumbered of the crowd which this dispute had gathered together,\nand more at leisure to consult about the measures necessary to be\ntaken. The old gentleman thanked them for their courtesy, which he did\nnot think proper to refuse, and while he led, or rather hauled\nMademoiselle over the way, under the auspices of the Castilian, Renaldo\nset the lover at liberty, made him a tender of his good offices, and\nadvised him to wait at the public-house for an happy issue of their\nnegotiation.\n\nThe pseudo-parson was very much affected by this generous proffer, for\nwhich he made suitable acknowledgments, and protested before God he\nwould die a thousand deaths rather than part with his dear Charlotte.\nHer father no sooner entered the apartment, than he was known by Joshua\nto be a considerable trader in the city of London, and the merchant was\nglad to find himself among his acquaintance. He was so full of the\nstory which had brought him thither, that he had scarce sat down when\nhe began to complain of his hard fate, in having an only child who was\nso mean, stubborn, and contumacious; and every sentence was concluded\nwith an apostrophe of reproaches to the delinquent.\n\nThe Jew having allowed him to ring out his alarm, condoled his\nmisfortune, and gravely counselled the young lady to wean her\naffections from such an unworthy object, for he supposed her favourite\nwas a man of no principle, or liberal endowments, otherwise her father\nwould not exclaim so bitterly against her conduct. Charlotte, who\nwanted neither beauty nor understanding, assured him that her lover’s\ncharacter was, in all respects, unblemished, for the truth of which\nassertion she appealed to her papa, who owned, with reluctance, that\nthe young man was a gentleman by birth, that he had served him with\nremarkable diligence and integrity, and that his accomplishments were\nfar superior to his station in life. “But then,” said he, “the fellow\nhas not a shilling of his own, and would you have me give away my\ndaughter to a beggar?”\n\n“God forbid!” cried the Jew, “I always understood you possessed an\nample fortune, and am sorry to find it otherwise.” “Otherwise!” cried\nthe citizen, with some acrimony, “take care what you say, sir; a\nmerchant’s credit is not to be tampered with.” “I beg your pardon,”\nanswered the Hebrew, “I concluded that your circumstances were bad,\nbecause you objected to the poverty of the young man after you had\nowned he was possessed of every other qualification to make your\ndaughter happy; for it is not to be imagined that you would thwart her\ninclinations, or seek to render an only child miserable on account of\nan obstacle which you yourself could easily remove. Let us suppose you\ncan afford to give with your daughter ten thousand pounds, which would\nenable this young man to live with credit and reputation, and engage\nadvantageously in trade, for which you say he is well qualified, the\nalternative then will be, whether you would rather see her in the arms\nof a deserving youth whom she loves, enjoying all the comforts of life\nwith a moderate fortune, which it will always be in your own power to\nimprove, or tied for life to a monied man whom she detests, cursing her\nhard fate, and despising that superfluity of wealth, in spite of which\nshe finds herself so truly wretched.”\n\nThe old gentleman seemed to be startled at this observation, which was\nreinforced by Renaldo’s saying, that he would, moreover, enjoy the\nunutterable pleasure of giving happiness to a worthy man, whose\ngratitude would co-operate with his love, in approving himself a\ndutiful son, as well as an affectionate husband. He then represented\nthe family disquiets and dismal tragedies produced from such mercenary\nand compulsive matches, and, in conclusion related the story of Don\nDiego and his daughter, which when the merchant heard, he started up\nwith marks of terror in his countenance, and, throwing up the casement,\ncalled upon Valentine with great vociferation. This was the name of his\ndaughter’s admirer, who no sooner heard the summons than he flew to the\nspot from whence it came, and the merchant, without any further\npreamble, seizing his hand, joined it with that of Charlotte, saying,\nwith great trepidation, “Here, take her, in the name of God, and thank\nthis honourable company for your good fortune.”\n\nThe lovers were transported with exquisite joy at this sudden\ndetermination in their favour. Valentine, having kissed the hand of his\nmistress with all the eagerness of rapture, and acknowledged the\nmerchant’s generosity, paid his respects to the ladies with a very\npolite address, and with demonstrations of uncommon gratitude and\nsensibility, thanked the gentlemen, and the Count in particular, for\ntheir good offices, to which he attributed the happiness he now\nenjoyed. While Serafina and Madam Clement caressed the amiable\nCharlotte, the rest of the company congratulated her admirer upon his\nchoice and success, though the clergyman could not help reprehending\nhim for profaning the sacerdotal habit.\n\nValentine heartily asked pardon for having given such cause of offence,\nand hoped he should be forgiven, as it was a disguise which he thought\nabsolutely necessary for the execution of a scheme upon which his\nhappiness depended. He then, at the request of Renaldo, unfolded the\nmystery of the hearse, by giving them to understand that Charlotte’s\nfather having got inkling of their mutual passion, had dismissed his\nclerk, and conveyed his daughter to a country-house in the\nneighbourhood of London, in order to cut off their correspondence;\nnotwithstanding these precautions they had found means to communicate\nwith each other by letters, which were managed by a third person; and\nhis rival being very importunate in his solicitations, they had\nconcerted the expedient of the hearse, which he provided and conducted\nthrough a road contiguous to the end of the merchant’s garden, where\nCharlotte, being apprised of the design, waited for its approach, and\nembarked in it without hesitation. Valentine thought himself\nsufficiently screened from discovery by his disguise, but he was\nunfortunately met by a servant of the family, who recollected his\nfeatures, and immediately gave the alarm, upon which the father and his\nfriends took horse, and pursued them by two different roads, until they\nwere overtaken at this place.\n\nHe had scarce finished this short relation, when his rival, bluntly\nentering the apartment, with an handkerchief tied round his eye,\ncommitted Valentine to the charge of a constable, who attended him, by\na warrant from a justice of the peace in that neighbourhood, and\nthreatened to prosecute the merchant on an action of damages for the\nloss of an eye, which he said he had sustained in his service. The\ncompany endeavoured to appease this citizen, by representing that his\nmisfortune was no other than a common inflammation, nor was it owing to\nmalice aforethought, but entirely to the precipitate passion of an\nincensed young man, who, by the bye, acted in his own defence. At the\nsame time the merchant promised to make any reasonable satisfaction,\nupon which the other demanded an obligation, importing that he would,\nin ten days from the date, bestow upon him his daughter in marriage,\nwith a portion of fifteen thousand pounds, or, in case of failure, pay\nhim double the sum.\n\nThe merchant, exasperated at this extravagant demand, told him flatly\nhe had already disposed of his daughter to Valentine, who, he believed,\nwas a much more deserving man, and that he was ready to wait upon the\nmagistrate who had granted the warrant, in order to give bail for his\nfuture son-in-law. This was a mortifying declaration to the plaintiff,\nthough he condoled himself with the hope of being a gainer by the loss\nof his eye, and now the pain was over would have been very sorry to\nfind his sight retrieved. The old gentleman, Joshua, and Renaldo\naccompanied the prisoner to the house of the justice, where he was\nimmediately admitted to bail. Upon their return Valentine shifted his\ndress, and they supped together with great cordiality and mirth,\nmaintained at the expense of the discarded lover.\n\nAfter supper Don Diego walked a minuet with Madam Clement; for whom, by\nthis time, he had contracted an extraordinary degree of affection.\nValentine had the honour to dance with the incomparable Serafina, whose\nbeauty and attractions dazzled the eyes of the new-comers, and struck\nher bashful partner with awe and confusion; and Melvil presented his\nhand to the agreeable Charlotte, who performed so much to the\nsatisfaction of her father, that he could not help expressing his joy\nand pride. He praised God for throwing him in the way of our company,\nand engaged the clergyman to unite the young couple, after having\nappointed a day for the ceremony, and invited all present to the\nwedding. The evening having been insensibly consumed in these\navocations, and the night pretty far advanced, the ladies withdrew\nwithout ceremony; and the retreat of Serafina filled Renaldo’s breast\nwith tumult and emotion; his blood began to flow in impetuous tides,\nhis heart to beat with redoubled vigour and velocity, while his eyes\nseemed to flash with more than human splendour. Now his imagination\nbegan to anticipate with the enthusiastic rage of an inspired sibyl; he\nwas instantaneously transported from the conversation, and every nerve\nwas braced to such a degree of impatience, that human nature could not\nlong endure the tension.\n\nHe, therefore, having withstood the impulse about a quarter of an hour,\nat length gave way to his impetuosity, and, springing from his friends,\nfound himself in a dark passage, at the farther end of which he\nperceived Madam Clement coming out of a chamber with a light, which, at\nsight of him, she set down, and vanished in a moment. This was the star\nthat pointed to his paradise; he hailed the signal, entered the\napartment, and, like a lion, rushing on his prey, approached the\nnuptial bed, where Serafina, surrounded by all the graces of beauty,\nsoftness, sentiment, and truth, lay trembling as a victim at the altar,\nand strove to hide her blushes from his view—the door was shut, the\nlight extinguished—he owned his lot was more than mortal man could\nclaim.\n\nHere let me draw the decent veil that ought to shade the secret\nmysteries of Hymen. Away, unhallowed scoffers, who profane, with idle\npleasantry or immodest hint, these holy rites; and leave those happy\nlovers to enjoy, in one another’s arms, unutterable bliss, the\nwell-earned palm of virtue and of constancy, which had undergone the\nmost severe refinement. A more deserving pair night’s curtain shrouds\nnot in its dark extent.\n\nThe thoughts of Renaldo’s felicity threw a damp on the spirits of\nValentine, who saw the term of his probation protracted a few days\nlonger, and could not help wishing in his heart that he had achieved\nthe adventure which would have abridged his expectation, though at the\nexpense of the old gentleman’s displeasure. He filled a bumper to the\nhealth of the bride and bridegroom, and throwing up his eyes with marks\nof admiration, exclaimed, “How happy is the Count! alas! five days\nlonger must I rein my impatience!” “It is but reasonable, you rogue,\nthat your betters should have the start of you,” said the merchant, who\ndid him justice in the glass, and counselled him to drown his\nimpatience with good claret. The youth followed his advice, and it was\nlate before the company retired to rest.\n\nThese citizens, however, resolved to seize an opportunity of rallying\nthe new-married couple, according to custom, and with that view arose\nearly in the morning, on the supposition of finding them still asleep;\nbut they were not a little surprised, when they entered the\nbreakfasting room, to see Renaldo, and his amiable bed-fellow, already\ndressed, and awaiting to do the honours of the house. The old gentleman\nwould fain have cracked a joke upon their extraordinary despatch, but\nhe was so much overawed by the dignity and tamed by the sweetness of\nSerafina’s carriage, that he durst not give utterance to his\nconception; and Valentine stood silent and abashed, as in the presence\nof a superior being. After breakfast these gentlemen and Charlotte\nagain expressed their sense of the obligations they owed to this happy\nfamily, repeated their invitation, and, taking leave, returned to\nLondon in a coach that was provided overnight.\n\nOur friends being thus left to themselves, Don Diego turned towards\nMelvil: “Now,” said he, “that I have yielded to the impatience of your\nlove, as well as to the eagerness of my own desire to make you happy, I\nmust beg leave to interrupt, for a little while, the stream of your\nmutual pleasure, and propose a melancholy excursion, which, however,\nwill not be wholly void of enjoyment. I have too long delayed the\nperformance of my duty at Antonia’s grave—let us spend the forenoon in\nthat pious pilgrimage—I will drop a few tears to the memory of that\nexcellent woman, and never afterwards shall my friends be troubled with\nmy grief.”\n\nThe proposal being universally approved, they set out for the place,\nwhich had oft been visited by the gentle Serafina, who conducted her\nfather to a black marble stone, which Renaldo had ordered to be laid\nover the grave; and, as he kneeled to kiss the monument, he perceived\nthis plain inscription in the Spanish tongue:—Antonia de Zelos primera\nen todo lo que es ser bueno, y sin segundo en todo lo que fue ser\ndesdichado, quedad con Dios! that is, Antonia de Zelos, unmatched in\nvirtue, and unequalled in misfortune, adieu! “O faithful record!” cried\nthe Castilian, smiting his breast, while his tears distilled upon the\nmarble, “thy goodness was the gift of Heaven, but thy misfortunes were\nderived from the guilt of Don Diego; yet his sorrow shall expiate his\noffence, and his penitence find favour in the sight of Heaven! Rest,\nrest, ill-fated virtue!—eternal peace shall guard thy tomb, and angels\nminister to thy unspotted shade; nor shall thine ashes lie in dark\nobscurity here will I raise a monument, more suited to thy excellence\nand name.” Serafina melted with filial tenderness; nor were the rest\nunmoved at this affecting scene, which Don Diego did not quit without\nreluctance.\n\nCHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN\n\nTHE LONGEST AND THE LAST.\n\nThe nature of this visit had softened every heart, and saddened every\ncountenance; and they walked in solemn silence to the other side of the\nchurch-yard, in order to regain their carriages; when, at the turning\nof the stile, they saw a young woman, in wretched attire, running out\nof a poor habitation, wringing her hands in all the agony of despair.\nNotwithstanding the distraction in her countenance, and the meanness of\nher apparel, she discovered a regularity of features, and a delicacy of\nair, which did not at all correspond with the misery of her equipage.\nThese exhibitions of extreme distress soon attracted the notice and\ncompassion of our company, and Melvil’s beauteous help-mate, accosting\nthis forlorn damsel with a pity-breathing aspect, asked the cause of\nher disorder.\n\n“Alas! dear lady,” cried the other, with all the emphasis of woe, “an\nunhappy gentleman now breathes his last within this inhospitable hovel,\namidst such excess of misery as would melt the most flinty bosom. What\nthen must I feel, who am connected with him by the strongest ties of\nlove and conjugal affection?” “Who is the unfortunate object?” said the\nphysician. “He was once well known in the gay world,” replied the young\nwoman; “his name is Fathom.” Every individual of the company started at\nmention of that detested name. Serafina began to tremble with emotion;\nand Renaldo, after a short pause, declared he would go in, not with a\nview to exult over his misery, but in order to contemplate the\ncatastrophe of such a wicked life, that the moral might be the more\ndeeply engraved on his remembrance. The young Countess, whose tender\nheart could not bear the shock of such a spectacle, retired to the\ncoach with Madam Clement and the Jew, while Renaldo, accompanied by the\nrest, entered a dismal apartment, altogether void of furniture and\nconvenience, where they beheld the wretched hero of these memoirs\nstretched almost naked upon straw, insensible, convulsed, and seemingly\nin the grasp of death. He was worn to the bone either by famine or\ndistemper; his face was overshadowed with hair and filth; his eyes were\nsunk, glazed, and distorted; his nostrils dilated; his lips covered\nwith a black slough; and his complexion faded into a pale clay-colour,\ntending to a yellow hue. In a word, the extremity of indigence,\nsqualor, and distress could not be more feelingly represented.\n\nWhile Melvil perused this melancholy lesson, and groaning, cried,\n“Behold the fate of man!” he perceived a letter in the right hand of\nthe unfortunate Fathom, which lay fast clenched across his breast.\nCurious to know the contents of this paper, which the young woman said\nhe had kept in that position for several days, he drew nearer the\nwretched couch, and was not a little surprised to see it addressed to\nthe Right Honourable Renaldo Count de Melvil, to the care of Mr. Joshua\nManesseh, merchant in London. When he attempted to disengage this\nbillet from the author’s hand, the sorrowing female fell upon her\nknees, entreating him to desist, and telling him, she had promised,\nupon oath, to communicate the contents to no person upon earth, but to\ncarry the letter, upon her husband’s decease, to the gentleman to whose\ncare it was directed.\n\nRenaldo assured her, upon his honour, that he was the very Renaldo\nCount de Melvil, for whom it was intended; and the young creature was\nso much confounded at this information, that, before she could\nrecollect herself, Melvil had opened the billet, and read these words:\n“If this paper should fall into the hands of the noble Renaldo, he will\nunderstand, that Fathom was the most execrable traitor that ever\nimposed upon unsuspecting benevolence, or attempted to betray a\ngenerous benefactor. His whole life was a series of fraud, perfidy, and\nthe most abominable ingratitude. But, of all the crimes that lay heavy\nupon his soul, his being accessory to the death of the incomparable\nSerafina, whose father he had also robbed, was that for which he\ndespaired of Heaven’s forgiveness, notwithstanding the dreadful\ncompunction and remorse which have long preyed upon his heart, together\nwith the incredible misery and deplorable death which by this time he\nhath undergone. Though these sufferings and sorrows cannot atone for\nhis enormous guilt, perhaps they will excite the compassion of the\nhumane Count de Melvil; at least, this confession, which my conscience\ndictates under all the terrors of death and futurity, may be a warning\nfor him to avoid henceforth a smiling villain, like the execrable\nFathom, upon whose miserable soul Almighty God have mercy.”\n\nRenaldo was deeply affected with the contents of this scroll, which\ndenoted such horror and despair. He saw there could be no dissimulation\nor sinister design in this profession of penitence. He beheld the\ncondition of the writer, which put all his humane passions in\ncommotion; so that he remembered nothing of Fathom but his present\ndistress. He could scarce maintain those indications which might have\nbeen justly deemed the effect of weakness and infirmity; and having\ndesired the physician and clergyman to contribute their assistance for\nthe benefit of that wretch’s soul and body, he ran to the coach, and\ncommunicated the letter to the ladies; at the same time drawing a\npicture of the object he had seen, which brought tears into the eyes of\nthe gentle Serafina, who earnestly entreated her lord to use his\nendeavours for the relief and recovery of the unhappy man, that he\nmight, if possible, live to enjoy the benefit of mature repentance, and\nnot die in that dreadful despair which he manifested in the letter.\n\nRenaldo, returning to the house, found the pious clergyman reading\nprayers with great fervency, while Don Diego stood with his right hand\nupon his breast, looking steadfastly upon the agonising Fathom, and the\nyoung woman kneeled, with her streaming eyes lifted up to heaven, in an\necstasy of grief and devotion. The physician had run to an apothecary’s\nshop in the neighbourhood, from whence he soon returned with an\nassistant, who applied a large blister to the back of the miserable\npatient, while the female, by the doctor’s direction, moistened his\nmouth with a cordial which he had prescribed.\n\nThese charitable steps being taken, Count de Melvil entreated the\napothecary’s servant to procure a tent-bed for the accommodation of the\nsick person with all imaginable despatch; and, in less than an hour,\none was actually pitched, and Fathom lifted into it, after he had been\nshifted, and in some measure purified from the dregs of his indigence.\nDuring this transaction the ladies were conducted to a tavern not far\noff, where dinner was bespoke, that they might be at hand to see the\neffect of their charity, which was not confined to what we have already\ndescribed, but extended so far, that, in a little time, the apartment\nwas comfortably furnished, and the young creature provided with change\nof apparel, and money to procure the necessaries of subsistence.\n\nNotwithstanding all their care, the wretched Fathom still remained\ninsensible, and the doctor pronounced a very unfavourable prognostic,\nwhile he ordered a pair of additional vesicatories to be laid upon his\narms, and other proper medicines to be administered. After dinner, the\nladies ventured to visit the place, and when Serafina crossed the\nthreshold, the weeping female fell at her feet, and, kissing her robe,\nexclaimed, “Sure you are an angel from heaven.”\n\nThe alteration in her dress had made a very agreeable change in her\nappearance, so that the Countess could now look upon her without\nshuddering at her distress. And, as Fathom was not in a condition to be\ndisturbed, she took this opportunity of inquiring by what steps that\nunfortunate wretch was conveyed from the prison, in which she knew he\nhad been confined, to the place where he now lay in such extremity; and\nby what occurrence he had found a wife in such an abyss of misfortune.\nHere the other’s tears began to flow afresh. “I am ashamed,” said she,\n“to reveal my own folly; yet I dare not refuse a satisfaction of this\nkind to a person who has laid me under such signal obligations.”\n\nShe then proceeded to relate her story, by which it appeared, she was\nno other than the fair and unhappy Elenor, whom the artful Fathom had\ndebauched upon his first arrival in town, in the manner already\ndescribed in these memoirs. “Heaven,” continued she, “was pleased to\nrestore the use of my reason, which I had lost when I found myself\nabandoned by the Count; but, all my connexion with my own family being\nentirely cut off, and every door shut against a poor creature who could\nprocure no recommendation, except the certificate signed by the\nphysician of Bedlam, which, instead of introducing me to service, was\nan insurmountable objection to my character, I found myself destitute\nof all means of subsisting, unless I would condescend to live the\ninfamous and wretched life of a courtezan, an expedient rendered\npalatable by the terrors of want, cooperating with the reflection of\nthe irretrievable loss I had already sustained. I ask pardon for\noffending your chaste ears with this impure confession of my guilt,\nwhich, Heaven knows, I then did, and now do look upon with abhorrence\nand detestation. I had already forfeited my innocence, and wanted\nresolution to encounter misery and death. Nevertheless, before I could\ndetermine to embrace the condition of a prostitute, I was one day\naccosted in the Park by an elderly gentleman who sat down by me upon a\nbench, and, taking notice of the despondence which was evident in my\ncountenance, pressed me to make him acquainted with the nature of my\nmisfortune. So much sympathy and good sense appeared in his deportment\nand conversation, that I gratified his request, and he, in return for\nmy confidence, saved me from the most horrible part of my prospect, by\ntaking me into his protection, and reserving me for his own appetite.\nIn this situation I lived a whole year, until I was deprived of my\nkeeper by an apoplectic fit, and turned out of doors by his relations,\nwho did not, however, strip me of the clothes and moveables which I\nowed to his bounty. Far from being as yet reconciled to a vicious life,\nI resolved to renounce the paths of shame, and, converting my effects\ninto ready money, hired a small shop, and furnished it with\nhaberdashery ware, intending to earn an honest livelihood by the sale\nof these commodities, together with the plain work in which I hoped to\nbe employed so soon as my talents should be known. But this scheme did\nnot answer my expectation. The goods spoiled upon my hands, and, as I\nwas a stranger in the neighbourhood, nobody would intrust me with any\nother business. So that, notwithstanding the most parsimonious economy,\nI ran in debt to my landlord, who seized my effects; and an hosier,\nfrom whom I had received some parcels upon credit, took out a writ\nagainst me, by virtue of which I was arrested and imprisoned in the\nMarshalsea, where I found my first seducer. Good Heaven! what did I\nfeel at this unexpected meeting, overwhelmed as I was before with my\nown distress! I with a loud scream fainted away, and, when I recovered,\nfound myself in the arms of Mr. Fathom, who wept over me with great\naffliction. All his prospects of gaiety had now vanished, and his heart\nwas softened by his own misfortunes, to a feeling of another’s woe, as\nwell as to a due sense of his own guilt. He expressed the deepest\nsorrow for having been the occasion of my ruin, endeavoured to comfort\nme with a promise of assistance, and indeed, by practising medicine\namong the prisoners, made shift to keep us both from starving. But\nsurely no sinner underwent such severe remorse as that which he\nsuffered during his imprisonment. From the day of our meeting, I never\nonce saw him smile; a melancholy cloud continually overhung his\ncountenance. He numbered the minutes by his groans, he used to start\nwith horror from his sleep, and, striking his breast, would exclaim, ‘O\nElenor! I am the worst of villains!’ Sometimes he seemed disordered in\nhis brain, and raved about Renaldo and Monimia. In a word, his mind was\nin a dreadful situation, and all his agonies were communicated to me,\nwhom by this time he had married, in order to make some atonement for\nmy wrongs. Wretched as he then was, I remembered the accomplished youth\nwho had captivated my virgin heart, the old impressions still remained,\nI saw his penitence, pitied his misfortune, and his wife being dead,\nconsented to join his fate, the ceremony having been performed by a\nfellow-prisoner, who was in orders. Though his hard-hearted creditor\nhad no other chance of being paid, than that of setting him at liberty,\nhe lent a deaf ear to all our supplications; and this cruelty\nconspiring with the anguish of my husband’s own reflection, affected\nhis health and spirits to such a degree, that he could no longer earn\nthe miserable pittance which had hitherto supported our lives. Then our\ncalamities began to multiply. Indigence and famine stared us in the\nface; and it was with the utmost difficulty that we resisted their\nattacks, by selling or pledging our wearing apparel, until we were left\nalmost quite naked, when we found ourselves discharged by an act passed\nfor the relief of insolvent debtors. This charitable law, which was\nintended for a consolation to the wretched, proved to us the most\nsevere disaster; for we were turned out into the streets, utterly\ndestitute of food, raiment, and lodging, at a time when Mr. Fathom was\nso weakened by his distemper, that he could not stand alone. I\nsupported him from door to door, imploring the compassion of charitable\nChristians, and was at length permitted to shelter him in this\nmiserable place, where his disease gaining ground, he lay three days in\nthat deplorable condition, from which he hath now been rescued, though\nI fear too late, by your humanity and benevolence.”\n\nShe shed a flood of tears at the conclusion of this mournful tale,\nwhich did not fail to affect the whole audience, especially Serafina,\nwho assured her, that, whatever should happen to her husband, she might\ndepend upon finding favour and protection, provided her conduct should\ncorrespond with her professions. While this grateful creature kissed\nthe hand of her kind benefactress, Fathom uttered a groan, began to\nstir in the bed, and with a languid voice called upon Elenor, who,\ninstantly withdrawing the curtain, presented the whole company to his\nview. He had now retrieved the use of his perception by the operation\nof the blisters, which began to torture him severely; he looked around\nhim with amazement and affright, and distinguishing the three persons\nagainst whom the chief arrows of his fraud and treachery had been\nlevelled, he concluded that he was now arrived at the land of departed\nsouls, and that the shades of those whom he had so grievously injured\nwere come to see him tormented according to his demerits.\n\nFraught with this notion, which was confirmed by the bodily pain which\nhe felt, and the appearance of the clergyman and Joshua, whom he\nmistook for the ministers of vengeance, he cried in a tone replete with\nhorror, “Is there no mercy then for penitence? Is there no pity due to\nthe miseries I suffered upon earth? Save me, O bountiful Heaven! from\nthe terrors of everlasting woe; hide me from these dreadful\nexecutioners, whose looks are torture. Forgive me, generous Castilian.\nO Renaldo! thou hadst once a tender heart. I dare not lift my eyes to\nSerafina! that pattern of human excellence, who fell a victim to my\natrocious guilt; yet her aspect is all mildness and compassion. Hah!\nare not these the drops of pity? Yes, they are the tears of mercy. They\nfall like refreshing showers upon my drooping soul! Ah, murdered\ninnocence! wilt thou not intercede for thy betrayer at the throne of\ngrace!”\n\nHere he was interrupted by Melvil, who with a grave and solemn air\npronounced, “Great hath been thy guilt, unhappy Ferdinand, and great\nhave been thy sufferings. Yet we come not to insult, but to alleviate\nthy distress. Providence hath kindly defeated thy dire intentions,\nwhich we therefore now forgive and transmit to oblivion, whether it be\nthy lot to yield up thy spirit immediately, or to survive the dangerous\nmalady with which thou art at present overwhelmed. Suffer not thyself\nto despair; for the mercy of Heaven is infinite; and submit to the\ndirections of this worthy gentleman, who will employ his skill for thy\nrecovery, while we shall take care to furnish thee with necessary\nattendance. As too much speaking may be prejudicial to thy health, I\ndispense with thy reply, and exhort thee to compose thyself to rest.”\nSo saying, he drew the curtain, and the company retired, leaving Fathom\nentranced with wonder.\n\nThe next step which Renaldo took for the benefit of this wretched\npenitent, was to send for the apothecary, with whom he left a sum of\nmoney to be expended for the convenience of Fathom and his wife; then\nhe laid injunctions upon the physician to repeat his visits; and that\ngentleman, together with the clergyman and Joshua, taking leave of the\nothers till next day, the Count set out with the ladies and his\nfather-in-law to the house where they had lodged the preceding night.\n\nThe reader may well imagine the conversation of the evening turned\nwholly upon the strange occurrence of the day, which seemed to have\nbeen concerted by supernatural prescience, in order to satisfy the\nvengeance, and afford matter of triumph to the generosity of those who\nhad been so grievously injured by the guilty Fathom. Though not one of\nthem would say that such a miscreant ought to live, yet all concurred\nin approving the offices of humanity which had been performed, and even\nendeavoured to find specious pretext for vindicating their compassion.\nDon Diego said, it would ill become a transgressor like him to withhold\nhis forgiveness from a sinner who had wronged him. Madam Clement\nappealed to the approbation of Heaven, which had undoubtedly directed\nthem that way, for the purpose they had fulfilled. Serafina observed,\nthat the crimes of the delinquent were obliterated by his sorrow,\nmisery, and repentance. Renaldo honestly owned, that, exclusive of\nother reasons, he could not deny himself the luxurious enjoyment of\ncommunicating happiness to his fellow-creatures in distress; and each\nfervently prayed, that their charity might not be disappointed by the\ndeath of the object.\n\nWhile they amused themselves in these discussions, Fathom, after having\nlain some hours silent, in consequence of Renaldo’s advice, could no\nlonger suppress the astonishment of his mind, but, addressing himself\nto his wife, “O Elenor!” said he, “my delirium is now past; though I\nstill remember the phantasies of my distempered brain. Among other\nreveries, my imagination was regaled with a vision so perfect and\ndistinct, as to emulate truth and reality. Methought Count de Melvil,\nDon Diego de Zelos, and the divine Serafina, the very persons who are\nnow crying before the throne of Heaven for vengeance against the guilty\nFathom, stood by my bedside, with looks of pity and forgiveness; and\nthat Renaldo spoke peace to my despairing soul. I heard the words\ndistinctly. I retain them in my memory. I saw the tears trickle from\nSerafina’s eyes. I heard her father utter a compassionate sigh; and\nshould actually believe that they were personally present, had not I\nlong ago seen with my own eyes the funeral procession of that young\nlady, whose wrongs God pardon; and were I not convinced that such a\nmeeting could not be effected without the immediate and miraculous\ninterposition of Heaven. Yet everything I now see corresponds with the\nwords of Renaldo, which still sound in my ears. When my perception\nforsook me, I lay in the most abject misery, among straw; and thou,\npoor injured innocence, wast naked and forlorn. Now, I find myself\nreposed in a warm, easy, comfortable bed. I see around me the marks of\nhuman charity and care, and the favourable change in thy appearance\nglads my poor dejected heart. Say, whence this happy alteration? Do I\nreally awake from that dream of misery in which we have continued so\nlong? or do I still utter the extravagant ravings of a distempered\nbrain?”\n\nElenor was afraid of imparting at once all the particulars of the happy\nchange he had undergone, lest they might leave a dangerous impression\nupon his fancy, which was not yet duly composed. She contented herself,\ntherefore, with telling him, that he had been obliged to the humanity\nof a gentleman and lady, who chanced to pass that way by accident, and\nwho, understanding his deplorable case, had furnished him with the\nconveniences which he now enjoyed. She then presented to him what the\ndoctor had directed her to administer, and, admonishing him to commit\nhis head to the pillow, he was favoured with a breathing sweat, fell\nfast asleep, and in a few hours waked again altogether cool and\nundisturbed.\n\nIt was upon this occasion that his wife explained the circumstances of\nthat visit which had redeemed him from extremity of wretchedness and\nthe jaws of death; upon which he started up, and throwing himself upon\nhis knees, exclaimed, “All-gracious Power! this was the work of thy own\nbounteous hand; the voice of my sorrow and repentance hath been heard.\nThou hast inspired my benefactors with more than mortal goodness in my\nbehalf; how shall I praise thy name! how shall I requite their\ngenerosity! Oh, I am bankrupt to both! yet let me not perish until I\nshall have convinced them of my reformation, and seen them enjoying\nthat felicity which ought to be reserved for such consummate virtue.”\n\nNext day, in the forenoon, he was visited by the physician, whom he now\nrecollected to have seen at the house of Madam Clement; and, after\nhaving thanked that gentleman for his humanity and care, he earnestly\nbegged to know by what means Serafina had been preserved. When he was\nsatisfied in this particular, and given to understand that she was now\nhappy in the arms of Renaldo, “Blessed be God!” he cried, “for having\ndefeated the villany of him who sought to part such lovers. Dear sir,\nwill you add one circumstance to your charity, and bear to that happy\ncouple, and the noble Don Diego, the respects and the remorse of a\nsincere penitent, whom their compassion hath raised to life? I have\nbeen such a traitor to them, that my words deserve no regard. I will\nnot therefore use professions. I dare not hope to be admitted into\ntheir presence. I am indeed ashamed to see the light of the sun. How\nthen could I bear the looks of that injured family? ah, no! let me hide\nmyself in some obscure retreat, where I may work out my salvation with\nfear and trembling, and pray incessantly to Heaven for their\nprosperity.”\n\nThe physician promised to represent his contrition to the Count and his\nlady, and accordingly proceeded to their habitation, where he repeated\nthese expressions, and pronounced his patient out of danger. So that\ntheir thoughts were now employed in concerting a scheme for his future\nsubsistence, that he might not be exposed by indigence to a relapse in\npoint of morals. Renaldo being still averse to any personal intercourse\nwith such a wretch, until he should give some undoubted proofs of\namendment, and, as yet afraid of intrusting him with any office that\nrequired integrity, resolved, with the approbation of all present, to\nsettle him in a cheap county in the north of England, where he and his\nwife could live comfortably on an annuity of sixty pounds, until his\nbehaviour should entitle him to a better provision.\n\nThis resolution was just taken, when Joshua arrived with a gentleman\nwhom he introduced to Don Diego as the secretary of the Spanish\nambassador. After the first compliments, the stranger told the\nCastilian, that he waited upon him at the desire of his Excellency, who\nwould have come in person, had he not been confined by the gout. Then\nhe put into his hand a letter from the court of Madrid, written by a\nnobleman of Diego’s acquaintance, who informed him, that Don Manuel de\nMendoza having made away with himself by poison, in order to avoid the\ndisgrace of a legal conviction, his Catholic Majesty was now convinced\nof Don Diego’s innocence, and granted him leave to return and take\npossession of his honours and estate. This information was confirmed by\nthe secretary, who assured him that the ambassador had orders to make\nhim acquainted with this favourable decision of the King. The Castilian\nhaving first acquitted himself in the most polite terms to the\nsecretary and the Jew, who, he said, had always been a messenger of\nglad tidings, communicated his happiness to the company; and this\nevening concluded the third day of their rejoicing.\n\nNext morning Don Diego went to visit the ambassador, accompanied by\nJoshua and the secretary; while the physician, repairing to the\nhabitation of Fathom, signified, by Renaldo’s direction, the resolution\nwhich had been taken in his behalf; and the patient no sooner heard his\ndoom, than, lifting up his hands, he cried, “I am unworthy of such\ntenderness and benevolence.” While Elenor shed a flood of tears in\nsilence, unable to give utterance to her grateful thought; Melvil’s\nbounty having so far transcended her most sanguine hope.\n\nThe Spaniard having paid his devoirs to his Excellency, returned before\ndinner; and, in the afternoon, desiring a private conference with\nSerafina, they retired into another apartment, and he expressed himself\nto this effect: “You have contracted, my dear child, an habit of\ncalling Madam Clement your mother, and doubtless, by her maternal\ntenderness and regard, she hath acquired a just title to the\nappellation. Yet I own I would fain strengthen it by a legal claim. I\nno sooner retrieved my daughter than I gave her away to the most\ndeserving youth that ever sighed with love.—I rejoice in the gift which\nsecured your happiness. But I left myself in a solitary situation,\nwhich even the return of my good fortune cannot render easy and\nsupportable. When I revisit the Castle of Zelos, every well-known\nobject will recall the memory of my Antonia, and I shall want a\ncompanion to fill her place, and to sympathise with me in that sorrow\nwhich will be derived from my remembrance. Who is there so worthy to\nsucceed your mother in the affection of Don Diego, as she who interests\nher love for Serafina, and resembles her so strongly in every virtue of\nthe sex? Similar attractions will produce similar effects. My heart is\nalready attached to that good lady; and, provided Serafina shall\napprove of my choice, I will lay myself and fortune at her feet.”\n\nThe fair Countess replied, with an enchanting smile, that, before this\ndeclaration, she had with pleasure perceived the progress which Madam\nClement had made in his heart; and that she did not believe there was a\nperson upon earth better qualified to repair the loss he had sustained;\nthough she foresaw one obstacle to his happiness, which she was afraid\nwould not be easily surmounted. “You mean,” answered the Castilian,\n“the difference of religion, which I am resolved to remove by adopting\nthe Protestant faith; though I am fully satisfied that real goodness is\nof no particular persuasion, and that salvation cannot depend upon\nbelief, over which the will has no influence. I invest you, therefore,\nwith the charge of declaring my passion and proposal, and empower you\nto satisfy her scruples with regard to the religion which I now\nprofess, and which I shall not openly relinquish, until I shall have\nsecured, in this country, effects sufficient to screen me from the ill\nconsequences of my King’s displeasure.”\n\nSerafina undertook this office with pleasure, because she had reason to\nthink his addresses would not be disagreeable to Madam Clement; and\nthat same night made the Count acquainted with the nature of her\ncommission. Nor was her expectation disappointed. The French lady, with\nthat frankness which is peculiar to virtue and good breeding, confessed\nthat Don Diego was not indifferent to her choice, and did not hesitate\nin receiving him upon the footing of a lover.—As we have already dwelt\ncircumstantially on the passion of love, so as perhaps even to have\ntired our readers, we shall not repeat the dialogue that passed, when\nthe Spaniard was indulged with an opportunity to explain his\nsentiments. Suffice it to observe, that the lady’s days of coquetry\nwere now over, and that she was too wise to trifle with the time, which\nevery moment became more and more precious. It was agreed then, that\nDon Diego should settle his affairs in Spain, and return to England, in\norder to espouse Madam Clement, with a view to fix his residence in\nthis island, where Renaldo likewise proposed to enjoy the sweets of his\nfortune, provided he could draw hither his interests and connexions.\n\nMeanwhile, having for some days enjoyed his bliss with all the fulness\nof rapture amidst this small but agreeable society, he shifted the\nscene, and conducted his dear partner to a ready-furnished house in\ntown, which, together with an occasional equipage, his friend Joshua\nhad hired for the accommodation of him and his father-in-law, who,\nduring his stay in England, failed not to cultivate the mistress of his\nheart with the most punctual assiduity. Hitherto Serafina had been as a\nprecious jewel locked up in a casket, which the owner alone had an\nopportunity to contemplate. But now the Count, who was proud of such a\nprize, resolved to let her shine forth to the admiration of the whole\nworld. With this view he bespoke such ornaments as befitted her\nquality, and, while the mantua-makers were employed in her service,\nmade a tour among his former acquaintance, and discharged the\nobligations under which he lay to some who had assisted him in his\ndistress. He did not, however, introduce them to his charming Serafina;\nbecause not one of them had formerly treated her with that delicacy of\nregard which he thought her due; and some of them were much mortified\nat their neglect, when they saw what a dazzling figure she made in the\nbeau monde.\n\nShe was visited by the Spanish and Imperial ambassadors, and divers\nother foreigners of distinction, to whom Melvil had letters of\nrecommendation. But her first public appearance was in a box at the\nopera, accompanied by Madam Clement, the Count, and Don Diego. The\nentertainment was already begun, so that her entrance had the greater\neffect upon the audience, whose attention was soon detached from the\nperformance, and riveted upon this amiable apparition, which seemed to\nbe some bright being of another world dropped from the clouds among\nthem. Then did the spirit of curiosity play its part. A thousand\nwhispers circulated; as many glasses were exalted to reconnoitre this\nbox of foreigners; for such they concluded them to be from their\nappearance. Every male spectator acknowledged Serafina to be the\nparagon of beauty; and every female confessed, that Melvil was the\nmodel of a fine gentleman. The charms of the young Countess did not\nescape the eye and approbation of royalty itself; and when her rank was\nknown, from the information of the ambassadors and other people of\ncondition who were seen saluting her at a distance, that same evening a\nthousand bumpers were swallowed in honour of the Countess de Melvil.\nThe fame of her beauty was immediately extended over this immense\nmetropolis, and different schemes were concerted for bringing her into\nlife. These, however, she resisted with unwearied obstinacy. Her\nhappiness centred in Renaldo, and the cultivation of a few friends\nwithin the shade of domestic quiet. She did not even forget the\nconcerns of the wretched Fathom and his faithful Elenor, who daily\nenjoyed fresh instances of her humanity and care. When his fever\nforsook him, he was supplied with nourishing food for the recovery of\nhis health; and as soon as he found himself in a condition to travel,\nhe gave notice to his benefactor, who desired Joshua to settle with him\nthe manner in which he was to receive his allowance, and to pay the\nfirst half-year’s salary per advance.\n\nThis affair being adjusted, and the place of his retreat signified, the\nJew told Elenor, that she might wait upon the Countess before their\ndeparture; and she did not fail to make use of this permission. After\nthey had made the necessary preparations for their journey, and taken\nplaces in the York stage-coach, Mrs. Fathom, clothing herself in decent\napparel, went to the house of Count Melvil, and was immediately\nadmitted to the presence of Serafina, who received her with her usual\ncomplacency, enriched her with salutary advice, comforted her with the\nhope of better things, provided her conduct and that of her husband\nshould henceforth be found irreproachable; and, wishing her peace and\nhappiness, presented her with a box of linen, and twenty guineas in a\npurse. Such excessive goodness overpowered this sensible young woman to\nsuch a degree, that she stood before her in speechless awe and\nveneration; and the Countess, in order to relieve her from the\nconfusion under which she suffered, quitted the room, leaving her to\nthe care of her woman. It was not long, however, before her gratitude\nbroke out in loud exclamations and a violent passion of tears, which\nall her efforts could not, for a while, overcome. By this time the\ncoach was brought up to the gate for the reception of Serafina, who\ntook an airing every day at the same hour; when Renaldo, leading her to\nthe vehicle, beheld a man plainly dressed standing within the court,\nwith his head and body bent towards the earth, so that his countenance\ncould not be perceived.\n\nMelvil, who supposed him to be some unfortunate man come to implore his\ncharity, turned towards him, and asked with a humane accent, if he\nwanted to speak with any person in the house? To this interrogation the\nstranger replied, without lifting up his head, “Overwhelmed as I am\nwith Count Melvil’s generosity, together with a consciousness of my own\nunworthiness, it ill becomes a wretch like me to importune him for\nfurther favour; yet I could not bear the thought of withdrawing,\nperhaps for ever, from the presence of my benefactor, without\nsoliciting his permission to see his face in mercy, to acknowledge my\natrocious crimes, to hear my pardon confirmed by his voice, and that of\nhis accomplished Countess, whom I dare not even at a distance behold;\nand to express my fervent wish for their prosperity.”\n\nMelvil, whose heart was but too tender, could not hear this address\nwithout emotion. He recognised the companion of his infancy and youth;\nhe remembered the happy scenes he had enjoyed with Fathom, whose voice\nhad always such an effect upon his ear, as to excite the ideas of\nfriendship and esteem; and he was disturbed by this unexpected meeting,\nwhich also discomposed the beauteous Serafina. Renaldo having paused a\nlittle, “It is with pain,” said he, “I recollect anything to the\nprejudice of Fathom, whose future behaviour will, I hope, erase the\nmemory of his offences, and justify what other steps I may take in his\nfavour. Meanwhile, I heartily forgive what is past; and, in token of my\nsincerity, present my hand;” which our adventurer bathed with his\ntears. The Countess, whose mind was in unison with her husband,\nrepeated her assurances of pardon and protection; at which the penitent\nrejoiced in silence, while he raised his head and took a parting view\nof those charms which had formerly enslaved his heart.\n\nHaving thus obeyed the dictates of his duty and inclination, he next\nmorning embarked in the stage-coach, with his faithful Elenor, and in\nsix days arrived at the place of his retreat, which he found extremely\nwell adapted to the circumstances of his mind and fortune. For all his\nvice and ambition was now quite mortified within him, and his whole\nattention engrossed in atoning for his former crimes, by a sober and\npenitent life, by which alone he could deserve the uncommon generosity\nof his patrons.\n\nWhile he thus accommodated himself to his new system, Renaldo received\nletters of congratulation from his sister, who with the Major had come\nto Brussels, in order to meet her brother and Serafina, according to\nhis proposal. This intimation being communicated to Don Diego, he\nresolved to accompany them to Flanders, on his way to Spain.\nPreparations were made for their departure; the clergyman and physician\nwere honoured with valuable marks of friendship and esteem from the\nCountess, Renaldo, and the Castilian, who were convoyed to Deal by\nMadam Clement, to whom, at parting, Don Diego presented a diamond ring,\nas a pledge of his inviolable love.\n\nHere the travellers hired a vessel for Ostend, which they reached in a\nfew hours; in two days more they arrived at Brussels, where Mrs. Farrel\nand her husband were struck with admiration at the surprising beauty\nand accomplishment of their sister-in-law, whom they caressed with\nequal tenderness and joy.—In a word, all parties were as happy as good\nfortune could make them; and Don Diego set out for Spain, after they\nhad agreed to reside in the Low Countries till his return.\n\nTHE END.", "chapters": [{"title": "COMPLETE IN TWO PARTS", "startIndex": 14}, {"title": "PART II.", "startIndex": 617}, {"title": "ILLUSTRATIONS", "startIndex": 1014}, {"title": "G.
