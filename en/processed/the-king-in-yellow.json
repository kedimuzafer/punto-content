Voila toute la différence.”\r\n\r\nToward the end of the year 1920 the Government of the United States had\r\npractically completed the programme, adopted during the last months\r\nof President Winthrop’s administration. The country was apparently\r\ntranquil. Everybody knows how the Tariff and Labour questions were\r\nsettled. The war with Germany, incident on that country’s seizure of\r\nthe Samoan Islands, had left no visible scars upon the republic, and\r\nthe temporary occupation of Norfolk by the invading army had been\r\nforgotten in the joy over repeated naval victories, and the subsequent\r\nridiculous plight of General Von Gartenlaube’s forces in the State of\r\nNew Jersey. The Cuban and Hawaiian investments had paid one hundred per\r\ncent and the territory of Samoa was well worth its cost as a coaling\r\nstation. The country was in a superb state of defence. Every coast\r\ncity had been well supplied with land fortifications; the army under\r\nthe parental eye of the General Staff, organized according to the\r\nPrussian system, had been increased to 300,000 men, with a territorial\r\nreserve of a million; and six magnificent squadrons of cruisers and\r\nbattle-ships patrolled the six stations of the navigable seas, leaving\r\na steam reserve amply fitted to control home waters. The gentlemen from\r\nthe West had at last been constrained to acknowledge that a college\r\nfor the training of diplomats was as necessary as law schools are for\r\nthe training of barristers; consequently we were no longer represented\r\nabroad by incompetent patriots. The nation was prosperous; Chicago, for\r\na moment paralyzed after a second great fire, had risen from its ruins,\r\nwhite and imperial, and more beautiful than the white city which had\r\nbeen built for its plaything in 1893. Everywhere good architecture was\r\nreplacing bad, and even in New York, a sudden craving for decency had\r\nswept away a great portion of the existing horrors. Streets had been\r\nwidened, properly paved and lighted, trees had been planted, squares\r\nlaid out, elevated structures demolished and underground roads built to\r\nreplace them. The new government buildings and barracks were fine bits\r\nof architecture, and the long system of stone quays which completely\r\nsurrounded the island had been turned into parks which proved a\r\ngod-send to the population. The subsidizing of the state theatre and\r\nstate opera brought its own reward. The United States National Academy\r\nof Design was much like European institutions of the same kind. Nobody\r\nenvied the Secretary of Fine Arts, either his cabinet position or his\r\nportfolio. The Secretary of Forestry and Game Preservation had a much\r\neasier time, thanks to the new system of National Mounted Police. We\r\nhad profited well by the latest treaties with France and England; the\r\nexclusion of foreign-born Jews as a measure of self-preservation, the\r\nsettlement of the new independent negro state of Suanee, the checking\r\nof immigration, the new laws concerning naturalization, and the gradual\r\ncentralization of power in the executive all contributed to national\r\ncalm and prosperity. When the Government solved the Indian problem and\r\nsquadrons of Indian cavalry scouts in native costume were substituted\r\nfor the pitiable organizations tacked on to the tail of skeletonized\r\nregiments by a former Secretary of War, the nation drew a long sigh of\r\nrelief. When, after the colossal Congress of Religions, bigotry and\r\nintolerance were laid in their graves and kindness and charity began to\r\ndraw warring sects together, many thought the millennium had arrived,\r\nat least in the new world which after all is a world by itself.\r\n\r\nBut self-preservation is the first law, and the United States had to\r\nlook on in helpless sorrow as Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium writhed\r\nin the throes of Anarchy, while Russia, watching from the Caucasus,\r\nstooped and bound them one by one.\r\n\r\nIn the city of New York the summer of 1899 was signalized by the\r\ndismantling of the Elevated Railroads. The summer of 1900 will live in\r\nthe memories of New York people for many a cycle; the Dodge Statue was\r\nremoved in that year. In the following winter began that agitation for\r\nthe repeal of the laws prohibiting suicide which bore its final fruit\r\nin the month of April, 1920, when the first Government Lethal Chamber\r\nwas opened on Washington Square.\r\n\r\nI had walked down that day from Dr. Archer’s house on Madison Avenue,\r\nwhere I had been as a mere formality. Ever since that fall from my\r\nhorse, four years before, I had been troubled at times with pains in\r\nthe back of my head and neck, but now for months they had been absent,\r\nand the doctor sent me away that day saying there was nothing more to\r\nbe cured in me. It was hardly worth his fee to be told that; I knew\r\nit myself. Still I did not grudge him the money. What I minded was\r\nthe mistake which he made at first. When they picked me up from the\r\npavement where I lay unconscious, and somebody had mercifully sent a\r\nbullet through my horse’s head, I was carried to Dr. Archer, and he,\r\npronouncing my brain affected, placed me in his private asylum where I\r\nwas obliged to endure treatment for insanity. At last he decided that I\r\nwas well, and I, knowing that my mind had always been as sound as his,\r\nif not sounder, “paid my tuition” as he jokingly called it, and left.\r\nI told him, smiling, that I would get even with him for his mistake,\r\nand he laughed heartily, and asked me to call once in a while. I did\r\nso, hoping for a chance to even up accounts, but he gave me none, and I\r\ntold him I would wait.\r\n\r\nThe fall from my horse had fortunately left no evil results; on the\r\ncontrary it had changed my whole character for the better. From a lazy\r\nyoung man about town, I had become active, energetic, temperate, and\r\nabove all—oh, above all else—ambitious. There was only one thing\r\nwhich troubled me, I laughed at my own uneasiness, and yet it troubled\r\nme.\r\n\r\nDuring my convalescence I had bought and read for the first time, _The\r\nKing in Yellow_. I remember after finishing the first act that it\r\noccurred to me that I had better stop. I started up and flung the book\r\ninto the fireplace; the volume struck the barred grate and fell open\r\non the hearth in the firelight. If I had not caught a glimpse of the\r\nopening words in the second act I should never have finished it, but\r\nas I stooped to pick it up, my eyes became riveted to the open page,\r\nand with a cry of terror, or perhaps it was of joy so poignant that\r\nI suffered in every nerve, I snatched the thing out of the coals and\r\ncrept shaking to my bedroom, where I read it and reread it, and wept\r\nand laughed and trembled with a horror which at times assails me yet.\r\nThis is the thing that troubles me, for I cannot forget Carcosa where\r\nblack stars hang in the heavens; where the shadows of men’s thoughts\r\nlengthen in the afternoon, when the twin suns sink into the lake of\r\nHali; and my mind will bear for ever the memory of the Pallid Mask.\r\nI pray God will curse the writer, as the writer has cursed the world\r\nwith this beautiful, stupendous creation, terrible in its simplicity,\r\nirresistible in its truth—a world which now trembles before the King\r\nin Yellow. When the French Government seized the translated copies\r\nwhich had just arrived in Paris, London, of course, became eager to\r\nread it. It is well known how the book spread like an infectious\r\ndisease, from city to city, from continent to continent, barred out\r\nhere, confiscated there, denounced by Press and pulpit, censured even\r\nby the most advanced of literary anarchists. No definite principles\r\nhad been violated in those wicked pages, no doctrine promulgated, no\r\nconvictions outraged. It could not be judged by any known standard,\r\nyet, although it was acknowledged that the supreme note of art had been\r\nstruck in _The King in Yellow_, all felt that human nature could not\r\nbear the strain, nor thrive on words in which the essence of purest\r\npoison lurked. The very banality and innocence of the first act only\r\nallowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect.\r\n\r\nIt was, I remember, the 13th day of April, 1920, that the first\r\nGovernment Lethal Chamber was established on the south side of\r\nWashington Square, between Wooster Street and South Fifth Avenue. The\r\nblock which had formerly consisted of a lot of shabby old buildings,\r\nused as cafés and restaurants for foreigners, had been acquired by\r\nthe Government in the winter of 1898. The French and Italian cafés\r\nand restaurants were torn down; the whole block was enclosed by a\r\ngilded iron railing, and converted into a lovely garden with lawns,\r\nflowers and fountains. In the centre of the garden stood a small,\r\nwhite building, severely classical in architecture, and surrounded by\r\nthickets of flowers. Six Ionic columns supported the roof, and the\r\nsingle door was of bronze. A splendid marble group of the “Fates” stood\r\nbefore the door, the work of a young American sculptor, Boris Yvain,\r\nwho had died in Paris when only twenty-three years old.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration ceremonies were in progress as I crossed University\r\nPlace and entered the square. I threaded my way through the silent\r\nthrong of spectators, but was stopped at Fourth Street by a cordon of\r\npolice. A regiment of United States lancers were drawn up in a hollow\r\nsquare round the Lethal Chamber. On a raised tribune facing Washington\r\nPark stood the Governor of New York, and behind him were grouped the\r\nMayor of New York and Brooklyn, the Inspector-General of Police, the\r\nCommandant of the state troops, Colonel Livingston, military aid to\r\nthe President of the United States, General Blount, commanding at\r\nGovernor’s Island, Major-General Hamilton, commanding the garrison of\r\nNew York and Brooklyn, Admiral Buffby of the fleet in the North River,\r\nSurgeon-General Lanceford, the staff of the National Free Hospital,\r\nSenators Wyse and Franklin of New York, and the Commissioner of Public\r\nWorks. The tribune was surrounded by a squadron of hussars of the\r\nNational Guard.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was finishing his reply to the short speech of the\r\nSurgeon-General. I heard him say: “The laws prohibiting suicide and\r\nproviding punishment for any attempt at self-destruction have been\r\nrepealed. The Government has seen fit to acknowledge the right of man\r\nto end an existence which may have become intolerable to him, through\r\nphysical suffering or mental despair. It is believed that the community\r\nwill be benefited by the removal of such people from their midst. Since\r\nthe passage of this law, the number of suicides in the United States\r\nhas not increased. Now the Government has determined to establish a\r\nLethal Chamber in every city, town and village in the country, it\r\nremains to be seen whether or not that class of human creatures from\r\nwhose desponding ranks new victims of self-destruction fall daily\r\nwill accept the relief thus provided.” He paused, and turned to the\r\nwhite Lethal Chamber. The silence in the street was absolute. “There a\r\npainless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this\r\nlife. If death is welcome let him seek it there.” Then quickly turning\r\nto the military aid of the President’s household, he said, “I declare\r\nthe Lethal Chamber open,” and again facing the vast crowd he cried in a\r\nclear voice: “Citizens of New York and of the United States of America,\r\nthrough me the Government declares the Lethal Chamber to be open.”\r\n\r\nThe solemn hush was broken by a sharp cry of command, the squadron of\r\nhussars filed after the Governor’s carriage, the lancers wheeled and\r\nformed along Fifth Avenue to wait for the commandant of the garrison,\r\nand the mounted police followed them. I left the crowd to gape and\r\nstare at the white marble Death Chamber, and, crossing South Fifth\r\nAvenue, walked along the western side of that thoroughfare to Bleecker\r\nStreet. Then I turned to the right and stopped before a dingy shop\r\nwhich bore the sign:\r\n\r\n                           HAWBERK, ARMOURER.\r\n\r\nI glanced in at the doorway and saw Hawberk busy in his little shop\r\nat the end of the hall. He looked up, and catching sight of me cried\r\nin his deep, hearty voice, “Come in, Mr. Castaigne!” Constance, his\r\ndaughter, rose to meet me as I crossed the threshold, and held out her\r\npretty hand, but I saw the blush of disappointment on her cheeks, and\r\nknew that it was another Castaigne she had expected, my cousin Louis.\r\nI smiled at her confusion and complimented her on the banner she was\r\nembroidering from a coloured plate. Old Hawberk sat riveting the worn\r\ngreaves of some ancient suit of armour, and the ting! ting! ting! of\r\nhis little hammer sounded pleasantly in the quaint shop. Presently he\r\ndropped his hammer, and fussed about for a moment with a tiny wrench.\r\nThe soft clash of the mail sent a thrill of pleasure through me. I\r\nloved to hear the music of steel brushing against steel, the mellow\r\nshock of the mallet on thigh pieces, and the jingle of chain armour.\r\nThat was the only reason I went to see Hawberk. He had never interested\r\nme personally, nor did Constance, except for the fact of her being\r\nin love with Louis. This did occupy my attention, and sometimes even\r\nkept me awake at night. But I knew in my heart that all would come\r\nright, and that I should arrange their future as I expected to arrange\r\nthat of my kind doctor, John Archer. However, I should never have\r\ntroubled myself about visiting them just then, had it not been, as\r\nI say, that the music of the tinkling hammer had for me this strong\r\nfascination. I would sit for hours, listening and listening, and when\r\na stray sunbeam struck the inlaid steel, the sensation it gave me was\r\nalmost too keen to endure. My eyes would become fixed, dilating with\r\na pleasure that stretched every nerve almost to breaking, until some\r\nmovement of the old armourer cut off the ray of sunlight, then, still\r\nthrilling secretly, I leaned back and listened again to the sound of\r\nthe polishing rag, swish! swish! rubbing rust from the rivets.\r\n\r\nConstance worked with the embroidery over her knees, now and then\r\npausing to examine more closely the pattern in the coloured plate from\r\nthe Metropolitan Museum.\r\n\r\n“Who is this for?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHawberk explained, that in addition to the treasures of armour in the\r\nMetropolitan Museum of which he had been appointed armourer, he also\r\nhad charge of several collections belonging to rich amateurs. This was\r\nthe missing greave of a famous suit which a client of his had traced to\r\na little shop in Paris on the Quai d’Orsay. He, Hawberk, had negotiated\r\nfor and secured the greave, and now the suit was complete. He laid down\r\nhis hammer and read me the history of the suit, traced since 1450 from\r\nowner to owner until it was acquired by Thomas Stainbridge. When his\r\nsuperb collection was sold, this client of Hawberk’s bought the suit,\r\nand since then the search for the missing greave had been pushed until\r\nit was, almost by accident, located in Paris.\r\n\r\n“Did you continue the search so persistently without any certainty of\r\nthe greave being still in existence?” I demanded.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he replied coolly.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time I took a personal interest in Hawberk.\r\n\r\n“It was worth something to you,” I ventured.\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied, laughing, “my pleasure in finding it was my reward.”\r\n\r\n“Have you no ambition to be rich?” I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n“My one ambition is to be the best armourer in the world,” he answered\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\nConstance asked me if I had seen the ceremonies at the Lethal Chamber.\r\nShe herself had noticed cavalry passing up Broadway that morning, and\r\nhad wished to see the inauguration, but her father wanted the banner\r\nfinished, and she had stayed at his request.\r\n\r\n“Did you see your cousin, Mr. Castaigne, there?” she asked, with the\r\nslightest tremor of her soft eyelashes.\r\n\r\n“No,” I replied carelessly. “Louis’ regiment is manœuvring out in\r\nWestchester County.” I rose and picked up my hat and cane.\r\n\r\n“Are you going upstairs to see the lunatic again?” laughed old Hawberk.\r\nIf Hawberk knew how I loathe that word “lunatic,” he would never use\r\nit in my presence. It rouses certain feelings within me which I do not\r\ncare to explain. However, I answered him quietly: “I think I shall drop\r\nin and see Mr. Wilde for a moment or two.”\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow,” said Constance, with a shake of the head, “it must be\r\nhard to live alone year after year poor, crippled and almost demented.\r\nIt is very good of you, Mr. Castaigne, to visit him as often as you do.”\r\n\r\n“I think he is vicious,” observed Hawberk, beginning again with his\r\nhammer. I listened to the golden tinkle on the greave plates; when he\r\nhad finished I replied:\r\n\r\n“No, he is not vicious, nor is he in the least demented. His mind is\r\na wonder chamber, from which he can extract treasures that you and I\r\nwould give years of our lives to acquire.”\r\n\r\nHawberk laughed.\r\n\r\nI continued a little impatiently: “He knows history as no one else\r\ncould know it. Nothing, however trivial, escapes his search, and his\r\nmemory is so absolute, so precise in details, that were it known in New\r\nYork that such a man existed, the people could not honour him enough.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” muttered Hawberk, searching on the floor for a fallen rivet.\r\n\r\n“Is it nonsense,” I asked, managing to suppress what I felt, “is it\r\nnonsense when he says that the tassets and cuissards of the enamelled\r\nsuit of armour commonly known as the ‘Prince’s Emblazoned’ can be\r\nfound among a mass of rusty theatrical properties, broken stoves and\r\nragpicker’s refuse in a garret in Pell Street?”\r\n\r\nHawberk’s hammer fell to the ground, but he picked it up and asked,\r\nwith a great deal of calm, how I knew that the tassets and left\r\ncuissard were missing from the “Prince’s Emblazoned.”\r\n\r\n“I did not know until Mr. Wilde mentioned it to me the other day. He\r\nsaid they were in the garret of 998 Pell Street.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” he cried, but I noticed his hand trembling under his\r\nleathern apron.\r\n\r\n“Is this nonsense too?” I asked pleasantly, “is it nonsense when Mr.\r\nWilde continually speaks of you as the Marquis of Avonshire and of Miss\r\nConstance—”\r\n\r\nI did not finish, for Constance had started to her feet with terror\r\nwritten on every feature. Hawberk looked at me and slowly smoothed his\r\nleathern apron.\r\n\r\n“That is impossible,” he observed, “Mr. Wilde may know a great many\r\nthings—”\r\n\r\n“About armour, for instance, and the ‘Prince’s Emblazoned,’” I\r\ninterposed, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he continued, slowly, “about armour also—may be—but he is\r\nwrong in regard to the Marquis of Avonshire, who, as you know, killed\r\nhis wife’s traducer years ago, and went to Australia where he did not\r\nlong survive his wife.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wilde is wrong,” murmured Constance. Her lips were blanched, but\r\nher voice was sweet and calm.\r\n\r\n“Let us agree, if you please, that in this one circumstance Mr. Wilde\r\nis wrong,” I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nI climbed the three dilapidated flights of stairs, which I had so often\r\nclimbed before, and knocked at a small door at the end of the corridor.\r\nMr. Wilde opened the door and I walked in.\r\n\r\nWhen he had double-locked the door and pushed a heavy chest against\r\nit, he came and sat down beside me, peering up into my face with his\r\nlittle light-coloured eyes. Half a dozen new scratches covered his\r\nnose and cheeks, and the silver wires which supported his artificial\r\nears had become displaced. I thought I had never seen him so hideously\r\nfascinating. He had no ears. The artificial ones, which now stood out\r\nat an angle from the fine wire, were his one weakness. They were made\r\nof wax and painted a shell pink, but the rest of his face was yellow.\r\nHe might better have revelled in the luxury of some artificial fingers\r\nfor his left hand, which was absolutely fingerless, but it seemed to\r\ncause him no inconvenience, and he was satisfied with his wax ears.\r\nHe was very small, scarcely higher than a child of ten, but his arms\r\nwere magnificently developed, and his thighs as thick as any athlete’s.\r\nStill, the most remarkable thing about Mr. Wilde was that a man of his\r\nmarvellous intelligence and knowledge should have such a head. It was\r\nflat and pointed, like the heads of many of those unfortunates whom\r\npeople imprison in asylums for the weak-minded. Many called him insane,\r\nbut I knew him to be as sane as I was.\r\n\r\nI do not deny that he was eccentric; the mania he had for keeping\r\nthat cat and teasing her until she flew at his face like a demon, was\r\ncertainly eccentric. I never could understand why he kept the creature,\r\nnor what pleasure he found in shutting himself up in his room with this\r\nsurly, vicious beast. I remember once, glancing up from the manuscript\r\nI was studying by the light of some tallow dips, and seeing Mr. Wilde\r\nsquatting motionless on his high chair, his eyes fairly blazing with\r\nexcitement, while the cat, which had risen from her place before the\r\nstove, came creeping across the floor right at him. Before I could\r\nmove she flattened her belly to the ground, crouched, trembled, and\r\nsprang into his face. Howling and foaming they rolled over and over\r\non the floor, scratching and clawing, until the cat screamed and fled\r\nunder the cabinet, and Mr. Wilde turned over on his back, his limbs\r\ncontracting and curling up like the legs of a dying spider. He _was_\r\neccentric.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilde had climbed into his high chair, and, after studying my face,\r\npicked up a dog’s-eared ledger and opened it.\r\n\r\n“Henry B. Matthews,” he read, “book-keeper with Whysot Whysot and\r\nCompany, dealers in church ornaments. Called April 3rd. Reputation\r\ndamaged on the race-track. Known as a welcher. Reputation to be\r\nrepaired by August 1st. Retainer Five Dollars.” He turned the page and\r\nran his fingerless knuckles down the closely-written columns.\r\n\r\n“P. Greene Dusenberry, Minister of the Gospel, Fairbeach, New Jersey.\r\nReputation damaged in the Bowery. To be repaired as soon as possible.\r\nRetainer $100.”\r\n\r\nHe coughed and added, “Called, April 6th.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are not in need of money, Mr. Wilde,” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” he coughed again.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. C. Hamilton Chester, of Chester Park, New York City. Called April\r\n7th. Reputation damaged at Dieppe, France. To be repaired by October\r\n1st Retainer $500.\r\n\r\n“Note.—C. Hamilton Chester, Captain U.S.S. ‘Avalanche’, ordered home\r\nfrom South Sea Squadron October 1st.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “the profession of a Repairer of Reputations is\r\nlucrative.”\r\n\r\nHis colourless eyes sought mine, “I only wanted to demonstrate that I\r\nwas correct. You said it was impossible to succeed as a Repairer of\r\nReputations; that even if I did succeed in certain cases it would cost\r\nme more than I would gain by it. To-day I have five hundred men in my\r\nemploy, who are poorly paid, but who pursue the work with an enthusiasm\r\nwhich possibly may be born of fear. These men enter every shade and\r\ngrade of society; some even are pillars of the most exclusive social\r\ntemples; others are the prop and pride of the financial world; still\r\nothers, hold undisputed sway among the ‘Fancy and the Talent.’ I choose\r\nthem at my leisure from those who reply to my advertisements. It is\r\neasy enough, they are all cowards. I could treble the number in twenty\r\ndays if I wished. So you see, those who have in their keeping the\r\nreputations of their fellow-citizens, I have in my pay.”\r\n\r\n“They may turn on you,” I suggested.\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his thumb over his cropped ears, and adjusted the wax\r\nsubstitutes. “I think not,” he murmured thoughtfully, “I seldom have to\r\napply the whip, and then only once. Besides they like their wages.”\r\n\r\n“How do you apply the whip?” I demanded.\r\n\r\nHis face for a moment was awful to look upon. His eyes dwindled to a\r\npair of green sparks.\r\n\r\n“I invite them to come and have a little chat with me,” he said in a\r\nsoft voice.\r\n\r\nA knock at the door interrupted him, and his face resumed its amiable\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n“Who is it?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Steylette,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“Come to-morrow,” replied Mr. Wilde.\r\n\r\n“Impossible,” began the other, but was silenced by a sort of bark from\r\nMr. Wilde.\r\n\r\n“Come to-morrow,” he repeated.\r\n\r\nWe heard somebody move away from the door and turn the corner by the\r\nstairway.\r\n\r\n“Who is that?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Arnold Steylette, Owner and Editor in Chief of the great New York\r\ndaily.”\r\n\r\nHe drummed on the ledger with his fingerless hand adding: “I pay him\r\nvery badly, but he thinks it a good bargain.”\r\n\r\n“Arnold Steylette!” I repeated amazed.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Wilde, with a self-satisfied cough.\r\n\r\nThe cat, which had entered the room as he spoke, hesitated, looked up\r\nat him and snarled. He climbed down from the chair and squatting on the\r\nfloor, took the creature into his arms and caressed her. The cat ceased\r\nsnarling and presently began a loud purring which seemed to increase in\r\ntimbre as he stroked her. “Where are the notes?” I asked. He pointed\r\nto the table, and for the hundredth time I picked up the bundle of\r\nmanuscript entitled—\r\n\r\n                   “THE IMPERIAL DYNASTY OF AMERICA.”\r\n\r\nOne by one I studied the well-worn pages, worn only by my own handling,\r\nand although I knew all by heart, from the beginning, “When from\r\nCarcosa, the Hyades, Hastur, and Aldebaran,” to “Castaigne, Louis de\r\nCalvados, born December 19th, 1877,” I read it with an eager, rapt\r\nattention, pausing to repeat parts of it aloud, and dwelling especially\r\non “Hildred de Calvados, only son of Hildred Castaigne and Edythe\r\nLandes Castaigne, first in succession,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished, Mr. Wilde nodded and coughed.\r\n\r\n“Speaking of your legitimate ambition,” he said, “how do Constance and\r\nLouis get along?”\r\n\r\n“She loves him,” I replied simply.\r\n\r\nThe cat on his knee suddenly turned and struck at his eyes, and he\r\nflung her off and climbed on to the chair opposite me.\r\n\r\n“And Dr. Archer! But that’s a matter you can settle any time you wish,”\r\nhe added.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied, “Dr. Archer can wait, but it is time I saw my cousin\r\nLouis.”\r\n\r\n“It is time,” he repeated. Then he took another ledger from the table\r\nand ran over the leaves rapidly. “We are now in communication with\r\nten thousand men,” he muttered. “We can count on one hundred thousand\r\nwithin the first twenty-eight hours, and in forty-eight hours the state\r\nwill rise _en masse_. The country follows the state, and the portion\r\nthat will not, I mean California and the Northwest, might better never\r\nhave been inhabited. I shall not send them the Yellow Sign.”\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to my head, but I only answered, “A new broom sweeps\r\nclean.”\r\n\r\n“The ambition of Caesar and of Napoleon pales before that which could\r\nnot rest until it had seized the minds of men and controlled even their\r\nunborn thoughts,” said Mr. Wilde.\r\n\r\n“You are speaking of the King in Yellow,” I groaned, with a shudder.\r\n\r\n“He is a king whom emperors have served.”\r\n\r\n“I am content to serve him,” I replied.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilde sat rubbing his ears with his crippled hand. “Perhaps\r\nConstance does not love him,” he suggested.\r\n\r\nI started to reply, but a sudden burst of military music from the\r\nstreet below drowned my voice. The twentieth dragoon regiment, formerly\r\nin garrison at Mount St. Vincent, was returning from the manœuvres in\r\nWestchester County, to its new barracks on East Washington Square. It\r\nwas my cousin’s regiment. They were a fine lot of fellows, in their\r\npale blue, tight-fitting jackets, jaunty busbys and white riding\r\nbreeches with the double yellow stripe, into which their limbs seemed\r\nmoulded. Every other squadron was armed with lances, from the metal\r\npoints of which fluttered yellow and white pennons. The band passed,\r\nplaying the regimental march, then came the colonel and staff, the\r\nhorses crowding and trampling, while their heads bobbed in unison, and\r\nthe pennons fluttered from their lance points. The troopers, who rode\r\nwith the beautiful English seat, looked brown as berries from their\r\nbloodless campaign among the farms of Westchester, and the music of\r\ntheir sabres against the stirrups, and the jingle of spurs and carbines\r\nwas delightful to me. I saw Louis riding with his squadron. He was as\r\nhandsome an officer as I have ever seen. Mr. Wilde, who had mounted a\r\nchair by the window, saw him too, but said nothing. Louis turned and\r\nlooked straight at Hawberk’s shop as he passed, and I could see the\r\nflush on his brown cheeks. I think Constance must have been at the\r\nwindow. When the last troopers had clattered by, and the last pennons\r\nvanished into South Fifth Avenue, Mr. Wilde clambered out of his chair\r\nand dragged the chest away from the door.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “it is time that you saw your cousin Louis.”\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the door and I picked up my hat and stick and stepped into\r\nthe corridor. The stairs were dark. Groping about, I set my foot on\r\nsomething soft, which snarled and spit, and I aimed a murderous blow at\r\nthe cat, but my cane shivered to splinters against the balustrade, and\r\nthe beast scurried back into Mr. Wilde’s room.\r\n\r\nPassing Hawberk’s door again I saw him still at work on the armour,\r\nbut I did not stop, and stepping out into Bleecker Street, I followed\r\nit to Wooster, skirted the grounds of the Lethal Chamber, and crossing\r\nWashington Park went straight to my rooms in the Benedick. Here I\r\nlunched comfortably, read the _Herald_ and the _Meteor_, and finally\r\nwent to the steel safe in my bedroom and set the time combination. The\r\nthree and three-quarter minutes which it is necessary to wait, while\r\nthe time lock is opening, are to me golden moments. From the instant\r\nI set the combination to the moment when I grasp the knobs and swing\r\nback the solid steel doors, I live in an ecstasy of expectation. Those\r\nmoments must be like moments passed in Paradise. I know what I am to\r\nfind at the end of the time limit. I know what the massive safe holds\r\nsecure for me, for me alone, and the exquisite pleasure of waiting is\r\nhardly enhanced when the safe opens and I lift, from its velvet crown,\r\na diadem of purest gold, blazing with diamonds. I do this every day,\r\nand yet the joy of waiting and at last touching again the diadem, only\r\nseems to increase as the days pass. It is a diadem fit for a King among\r\nkings, an Emperor among emperors. The King in Yellow might scorn it,\r\nbut it shall be worn by his royal servant.\r\n\r\nI held it in my arms until the alarm in the safe rang harshly, and then\r\ntenderly, proudly, I replaced it and shut the steel doors. I walked\r\nslowly back into my study, which faces Washington Square, and leaned\r\non the window sill. The afternoon sun poured into my windows, and a\r\ngentle breeze stirred the branches of the elms and maples in the park,\r\nnow covered with buds and tender foliage. A flock of pigeons circled\r\nabout the tower of the Memorial Church; sometimes alighting on the\r\npurple tiled roof, sometimes wheeling downward to the lotos fountain\r\nin front of the marble arch. The gardeners were busy with the flower\r\nbeds around the fountain, and the freshly turned earth smelled sweet\r\nand spicy. A lawn mower, drawn by a fat white horse, clinked across\r\nthe green sward, and watering-carts poured showers of spray over the\r\nasphalt drives. Around the statue of Peter Stuyvesant, which in 1897\r\nhad replaced the monstrosity supposed to represent Garibaldi, children\r\nplayed in the spring sunshine, and nurse girls wheeled elaborate baby\r\ncarriages with a reckless disregard for the pasty-faced occupants,\r\nwhich could probably be explained by the presence of half a dozen trim\r\ndragoon troopers languidly lolling on the benches. Through the trees,\r\nthe Washington Memorial Arch glistened like silver in the sunshine, and\r\nbeyond, on the eastern extremity of the square the grey stone barracks\r\nof the dragoons, and the white granite artillery stables were alive\r\nwith colour and motion.\r\n\r\nI looked at the Lethal Chamber on the corner of the square opposite. A\r\nfew curious people still lingered about the gilded iron railing, but\r\ninside the grounds the paths were deserted. I watched the fountains\r\nripple and sparkle; the sparrows had already found this new bathing\r\nnook, and the basins were covered with the dusty-feathered little\r\nthings. Two or three white peacocks picked their way across the lawns,\r\nand a drab coloured pigeon sat so motionless on the arm of one of the\r\n“Fates,” that it seemed to be a part of the sculptured stone.\r\n\r\nAs I was turning carelessly away, a slight commotion in the group of\r\ncurious loiterers around the gates attracted my attention. A young man\r\nhad entered, and was advancing with nervous strides along the gravel\r\npath which leads to the bronze doors of the Lethal Chamber. He paused\r\na moment before the “Fates,” and as he raised his head to those three\r\nmysterious faces, the pigeon rose from its sculptured perch, circled\r\nabout for a moment and wheeled to the east. The young man pressed his\r\nhand to his face, and then with an undefinable gesture sprang up the\r\nmarble steps, the bronze doors closed behind him, and half an hour\r\nlater the loiterers slouched away, and the frightened pigeon returned\r\nto its perch in the arms of Fate.\r\n\r\nI put on my hat and went out into the park for a little walk before\r\ndinner. As I crossed the central driveway a group of officers passed,\r\nand one of them called out, “Hello, Hildred,” and came back to shake\r\nhands with me. It was my cousin Louis, who stood smiling and tapping\r\nhis spurred heels with his riding-whip.\r\n\r\n“Just back from Westchester,” he said; “been doing the bucolic; milk\r\nand curds, you know, dairy-maids in sunbonnets, who say ‘haeow’ and ‘I\r\ndon’t think’ when you tell them they are pretty. I’m nearly dead for a\r\nsquare meal at Delmonico’s. What’s the news?”\r\n\r\n“There is none,” I replied pleasantly. “I saw your regiment coming in\r\nthis morning.”\r\n\r\n“Did you? I didn’t see you. Where were you?”\r\n\r\n“In Mr. Wilde’s window.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, hell!” he began impatiently, “that man is stark mad! I don’t\r\nunderstand why you—”\r\n\r\nHe saw how annoyed I felt by this outburst, and begged my pardon.\r\n\r\n“Really, old chap,” he said, “I don’t mean to run down a man you\r\nlike, but for the life of me I can’t see what the deuce you find in\r\ncommon with Mr. Wilde. He’s not well bred, to put it generously; he is\r\nhideously deformed; his head is the head of a criminally insane person.\r\nYou know yourself he’s been in an asylum—”\r\n\r\n“So have I,” I interrupted calmly.\r\n\r\nLouis looked startled and confused for a moment, but recovered and\r\nslapped me heartily on the shoulder. “You were completely cured,” he\r\nbegan; but I stopped him again.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you mean that I was simply acknowledged never to have been\r\ninsane.”\r\n\r\n“Of course that—that’s what I meant,” he laughed.\r\n\r\nI disliked his laugh because I knew it was forced, but I nodded gaily\r\nand asked him where he was going. Louis looked after his brother\r\nofficers who had now almost reached Broadway.\r\n\r\n“We had intended to sample a Brunswick cocktail, but to tell you the\r\ntruth I was anxious for an excuse to go and see Hawberk instead. Come\r\nalong, I’ll make you my excuse.”\r\n\r\nWe found old Hawberk, neatly attired in a fresh spring suit, standing\r\nat the door of his shop and sniffing the air.\r\n\r\n“I had just decided to take Constance for a little stroll before\r\ndinner,” he replied to the impetuous volley of questions from Louis.\r\n“We thought of walking on the park terrace along the North River.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment Constance appeared and grew pale and rosy by turns as\r\nLouis bent over her small gloved fingers. I tried to excuse myself,\r\nalleging an engagement uptown, but Louis and Constance would not\r\nlisten, and I saw I was expected to remain and engage old Hawberk’s\r\nattention. After all it would be just as well if I kept my eye on\r\nLouis, I thought, and when they hailed a Spring Street horse-car, I got\r\nin after them and took my seat beside the armourer.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful line of parks and granite terraces overlooking the\r\nwharves along the North River, which were built in 1910 and finished\r\nin the autumn of 1917, had become one of the most popular promenades\r\nin the metropolis. They extended from the battery to 190th Street,\r\noverlooking the noble river and affording a fine view of the Jersey\r\nshore and the Highlands opposite. Cafés and restaurants were scattered\r\nhere and there among the trees, and twice a week military bands from\r\nthe garrison played in the kiosques on the parapets.\r\n\r\nWe sat down in the sunshine on the bench at the foot of the equestrian\r\nstatue of General Sheridan. Constance tipped her sunshade to shield\r\nher eyes, and she and Louis began a murmuring conversation which was\r\nimpossible to catch. Old Hawberk, leaning on his ivory headed cane,\r\nlighted an excellent cigar, the mate to which I politely refused, and\r\nsmiled at vacancy. The sun hung low above the Staten Island woods, and\r\nthe bay was dyed with golden hues reflected from the sun-warmed sails\r\nof the shipping in the harbour.\r\n\r\nBrigs, schooners, yachts, clumsy ferry-boats, their decks swarming\r\nwith people, railroad transports carrying lines of brown, blue and\r\nwhite freight cars, stately sound steamers, déclassé tramp steamers,\r\ncoasters, dredgers, scows, and everywhere pervading the entire bay\r\nimpudent little tugs puffing and whistling officiously;—these were the\r\ncraft which churned the sunlight waters as far as the eye could reach.\r\nIn calm contrast to the hurry of sailing vessel and steamer a silent\r\nfleet of white warships lay motionless in midstream.\r\n\r\nConstance’s merry laugh aroused me from my reverie.\r\n\r\n“What _are_ you staring at?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“Nothing—the fleet,” I smiled.\r\n\r\nThen Louis told us what the vessels were, pointing out each by its\r\nrelative position to the old Red Fort on Governor’s Island.\r\n\r\n“That little cigar shaped thing is a torpedo boat,” he explained;\r\n“there are four more lying close together. They are the _Tarpon_, the\r\n_Falcon_, the _Sea Fox_, and the _Octopus_. The gun-boats just above\r\nare the _Princeton_, the _Champlain_, the _Still Water_ and the _Erie_.\r\nNext to them lie the cruisers _Faragut_ and _Los Angeles_, and above\r\nthem the battle ships _California_, and _Dakota_, and the _Washington_\r\nwhich is the flag ship. Those two squatty looking chunks of metal which\r\nare anchored there off Castle William are the double turreted monitors\r\n_Terrible_ and _Magnificent_; behind them lies the ram, _Osceola_.”\r\n\r\nConstance looked at him with deep approval in her beautiful eyes. “What\r\nloads of things you know for a soldier,” she said, and we all joined in\r\nthe laugh which followed.\r\n\r\nPresently Louis rose with a nod to us and offered his arm to Constance,\r\nand they strolled away along the river wall. Hawberk watched them for a\r\nmoment and then turned to me.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wilde was right,” he said. “I have found the missing tassets and\r\nleft cuissard of the ‘Prince’s Emblazoned,’ in a vile old junk garret\r\nin Pell Street.”\r\n\r\n“998?” I inquired, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wilde is a very intelligent man,” I observed.\r\n\r\n“I want to give him the credit of this most important discovery,”\r\ncontinued Hawberk. “And I intend it shall be known that he is entitled\r\nto the fame of it.”\r\n\r\n“He won’t thank you for that,” I answered sharply; “please say nothing\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what it is worth?” said Hawberk.\r\n\r\n“No, fifty dollars, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“It is valued at five hundred, but the owner of the ‘Prince’s\r\nEmblazoned’ will give two thousand dollars to the person who completes\r\nhis suit; that reward also belongs to Mr. Wilde.”\r\n\r\n“He doesn’t want it! He refuses it!” I answered angrily. “What do you\r\nknow about Mr. Wilde? He doesn’t need the money. He is rich—or will\r\nbe—richer than any living man except myself. What will we care for\r\nmoney then—what will we care, he and I, when—when—”\r\n\r\n“When what?” demanded Hawberk, astonished.\r\n\r\n“You will see,” I replied, on my guard again.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me narrowly, much as Doctor Archer used to, and I knew he\r\nthought I was mentally unsound. Perhaps it was fortunate for him that\r\nhe did not use the word lunatic just then.\r\n\r\n“No,” I replied to his unspoken thought, “I am not mentally weak; my\r\nmind is as healthy as Mr. Wilde’s. I do not care to explain just yet\r\nwhat I have on hand, but it is an investment which will pay more than\r\nmere gold, silver and precious stones. It will secure the happiness and\r\nprosperity of a continent—yes, a hemisphere!”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Hawberk.\r\n\r\n“And eventually,” I continued more quietly, “it will secure the\r\nhappiness of the whole world.”\r\n\r\n“And incidentally your own happiness and prosperity as well as Mr.\r\nWilde’s?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” I smiled. But I could have throttled him for taking that\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me in silence for a while and then said very gently, “Why\r\ndon’t you give up your books and studies, Mr. Castaigne, and take a\r\ntramp among the mountains somewhere or other? You used to be fond of\r\nfishing. Take a cast or two at the trout in the Rangelys.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care for fishing any more,” I answered, without a shade of\r\nannoyance in my voice.\r\n\r\n“You used to be fond of everything,” he continued; “athletics,\r\nyachting, shooting, riding—”\r\n\r\n“I have never cared to ride since my fall,” I said quietly.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, your fall,” he repeated, looking away from me.\r\n\r\nI thought this nonsense had gone far enough, so I brought the\r\nconversation back to Mr. Wilde; but he was scanning my face again in a\r\nmanner highly offensive to me.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wilde,” he repeated, “do you know what he did this afternoon? He\r\ncame downstairs and nailed a sign over the hall door next to mine; it\r\nread:\r\n\r\n                               “MR. WILDE,\r\n                        REPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS.\r\n                               Third Bell.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what a Repairer of Reputations can be?”\r\n\r\n“I do,” I replied, suppressing the rage within.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he said again.\r\n\r\nLouis and Constance came strolling by and stopped to ask if we would\r\njoin them. Hawberk looked at his watch. At the same moment a puff of\r\nsmoke shot from the casemates of Castle William, and the boom of the\r\nsunset gun rolled across the water and was re-echoed from the Highlands\r\nopposite. The flag came running down from the flag-pole, the bugles\r\nsounded on the white decks of the warships, and the first electric\r\nlight sparkled out from the Jersey shore.\r\n\r\nAs I turned into the city with Hawberk I heard Constance murmur\r\nsomething to Louis which I did not understand; but Louis whispered “My\r\ndarling,” in reply; and again, walking ahead with Hawberk through the\r\nsquare I heard a murmur of “sweetheart,” and “my own Constance,” and\r\nI knew the time had nearly arrived when I should speak of important\r\nmatters with my cousin Louis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nOne morning early in May I stood before the steel safe in my bedroom,\r\ntrying on the golden jewelled crown. The diamonds flashed fire as I\r\nturned to the mirror, and the heavy beaten gold burned like a halo\r\nabout my head. I remembered Camilla’s agonized scream and the awful\r\nwords echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa. They were the last\r\nlines in the first act, and I dared not think of what followed—dared\r\nnot, even in the spring sunshine, there in my own room, surrounded\r\nwith familiar objects, reassured by the bustle from the street and the\r\nvoices of the servants in the hallway outside. For those poisoned words\r\nhad dropped slowly into my heart, as death-sweat drops upon a bed-sheet\r\nand is absorbed. Trembling, I put the diadem from my head and wiped my\r\nforehead, but I thought of Hastur and of my own rightful ambition, and\r\nI remembered Mr. Wilde as I had last left him, his face all torn and\r\nbloody from the claws of that devil’s creature, and what he said—ah,\r\nwhat he said. The alarm bell in the safe began to whirr harshly, and\r\nI knew my time was up; but I would not heed it, and replacing the\r\nflashing circlet upon my head I turned defiantly to the mirror. I stood\r\nfor a long time absorbed in the changing expression of my own eyes.\r\nThe mirror reflected a face which was like my own, but whiter, and so\r\nthin that I hardly recognized it. And all the time I kept repeating\r\nbetween my clenched teeth, “The day has come! the day has come!” while\r\nthe alarm in the safe whirred and clamoured, and the diamonds sparkled\r\nand flamed above my brow. I heard a door open but did not heed it. It\r\nwas only when I saw two faces in the mirror:—it was only when another\r\nface rose over my shoulder, and two other eyes met mine. I wheeled\r\nlike a flash and seized a long knife from my dressing-table, and my\r\ncousin sprang back very pale, crying: “Hildred! for God’s sake!” then\r\nas my hand fell, he said: “It is I, Louis, don’t you know me?” I stood\r\nsilent. I could not have spoken for my life. He walked up to me and\r\ntook the knife from my hand.\r\n\r\n“What is all this?” he inquired, in a gentle voice. “Are you ill?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I replied. But I doubt if he heard me.\r\n\r\n“Come, come, old fellow,” he cried, “take off that brass crown and\r\ntoddle into the study. Are you going to a masquerade? What’s all this\r\ntheatrical tinsel anyway?”\r\n\r\nI was glad he thought the crown was made of brass and paste, yet I\r\ndidn’t like him any the better for thinking so. I let him take it from\r\nmy hand, knowing it was best to humour him. He tossed the splendid\r\ndiadem in the air, and catching it, turned to me smiling.\r\n\r\n“It’s dear at fifty cents,” he said. “What’s it for?”\r\n\r\nI did not answer, but took the circlet from his hands, and placing it\r\nin the safe shut the massive steel door. The alarm ceased its infernal\r\ndin at once. He watched me curiously, but did not seem to notice the\r\nsudden ceasing of the alarm. He did, however, speak of the safe as a\r\nbiscuit box. Fearing lest he might examine the combination I led the\r\nway into my study. Louis threw himself on the sofa and flicked at flies\r\nwith his eternal riding-whip. He wore his fatigue uniform with the\r\nbraided jacket and jaunty cap, and I noticed that his riding-boots were\r\nall splashed with red mud.\r\n\r\n“Where have you been?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“Jumping mud creeks in Jersey,” he said. “I haven’t had time to change\r\nyet; I was rather in a hurry to see you. Haven’t you got a glass of\r\nsomething? I’m dead tired; been in the saddle twenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\nI gave him some brandy from my medicinal store, which he drank with a\r\ngrimace.\r\n\r\n“Damned bad stuff,” he observed. “I’ll give you an address where they\r\nsell brandy that is brandy.”\r\n\r\n“It’s good enough for my needs,” I said indifferently. “I use it to rub\r\nmy chest with.” He stared and flicked at another fly.\r\n\r\n“See here, old fellow,” he began, “I’ve got something to suggest to\r\nyou. It’s four years now that you’ve shut yourself up here like an owl,\r\nnever going anywhere, never taking any healthy exercise, never doing a\r\ndamn thing but poring over those books up there on the mantelpiece.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced along the row of shelves. “Napoleon, Napoleon, Napoleon!” he\r\nread. “For heaven’s sake, have you nothing but Napoleons there?”\r\n\r\n“I wish they were bound in gold,” I said. “But wait, yes, there is\r\nanother book, _The King in Yellow_.” I looked him steadily in the eye.\r\n\r\n“Have you never read it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I? No, thank God! I don’t want to be driven crazy.”\r\n\r\nI saw he regretted his speech as soon as he had uttered it. There is\r\nonly one word which I loathe more than I do lunatic and that word is\r\ncrazy. But I controlled myself and asked him why he thought _The King\r\nin Yellow_ dangerous.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know,” he said, hastily. “I only remember the excitement\r\nit created and the denunciations from pulpit and Press. I believe the\r\nauthor shot himself after bringing forth this monstrosity, didn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“I understand he is still alive,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“That’s probably true,” he muttered; “bullets couldn’t kill a fiend\r\nlike that.”\r\n\r\n“It is a book of great truths,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he replied, “of ‘truths’ which send men frantic and blast their\r\nlives. I don’t care if the thing is, as they say, the very supreme\r\nessence of art. It’s a crime to have written it, and I for one shall\r\nnever open its pages.”\r\n\r\n“Is that what you have come to tell me?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, “I came to tell you that I am going to be married.”\r\n\r\nI believe for a moment my heart ceased to beat, but I kept my eyes on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he continued, smiling happily, “married to the sweetest girl on\r\nearth.”\r\n\r\n“Constance Hawberk,” I said mechanically.\r\n\r\n“How did you know?” he cried, astonished. “I didn’t know it myself\r\nuntil that evening last April, when we strolled down to the embankment\r\nbefore dinner.”\r\n\r\n“When is it to be?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It was to have been next September, but an hour ago a despatch came\r\nordering our regiment to the Presidio, San Francisco. We leave at noon\r\nto-morrow. To-morrow,” he repeated. “Just think, Hildred, to-morrow I\r\nshall be the happiest fellow that ever drew breath in this jolly world,\r\nfor Constance will go with me.”\r\n\r\nI offered him my hand in congratulation, and he seized and shook it\r\nlike the good-natured fool he was—or pretended to be.\r\n\r\n“I am going to get my squadron as a wedding present,” he rattled on.\r\n“Captain and Mrs. Louis Castaigne, eh, Hildred?”\r\n\r\nThen he told me where it was to be and who were to be there, and made\r\nme promise to come and be best man. I set my teeth and listened to his\r\nboyish chatter without showing what I felt, but—\r\n\r\nI was getting to the limit of my endurance, and when he jumped up,\r\nand, switching his spurs till they jingled, said he must go, I did not\r\ndetain him.\r\n\r\n“There’s one thing I want to ask of you,” I said quietly.\r\n\r\n“Out with it, it’s promised,” he laughed.\r\n\r\n“I want you to meet me for a quarter of an hour’s talk to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, if you wish,” he said, somewhat puzzled. “Where?”\r\n\r\n“Anywhere, in the park there.”\r\n\r\n“What time, Hildred?”\r\n\r\n“Midnight.”\r\n\r\n“What in the name of—” he began, but checked himself and laughingly\r\nassented. I watched him go down the stairs and hurry away, his sabre\r\nbanging at every stride. He turned into Bleecker Street, and I knew he\r\nwas going to see Constance. I gave him ten minutes to disappear and\r\nthen followed in his footsteps, taking with me the jewelled crown and\r\nthe silken robe embroidered with the Yellow Sign. When I turned into\r\nBleecker Street, and entered the doorway which bore the sign—\r\n\r\n                               MR. WILDE,\r\n                        REPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS.\r\n                               Third Bell.\r\n\r\nI saw old Hawberk moving about in his shop, and imagined I heard\r\nConstance’s voice in the parlour; but I avoided them both and hurried\r\nup the trembling stairways to Mr. Wilde’s apartment. I knocked and\r\nentered without ceremony. Mr. Wilde lay groaning on the floor, his face\r\ncovered with blood, his clothes torn to shreds. Drops of blood were\r\nscattered about over the carpet, which had also been ripped and frayed\r\nin the evidently recent struggle.\r\n\r\n“It’s that cursed cat,” he said, ceasing his groans, and turning his\r\ncolourless eyes to me; “she attacked me while I was asleep. I believe\r\nshe will kill me yet.”\r\n\r\nThis was too much, so I went into the kitchen, and, seizing a hatchet\r\nfrom the pantry, started to find the infernal beast and settle her then\r\nand there. My search was fruitless, and after a while I gave it up and\r\ncame back to find Mr. Wilde squatting on his high chair by the table.\r\nHe had washed his face and changed his clothes. The great furrows\r\nwhich the cat’s claws had ploughed up in his face he had filled with\r\ncollodion, and a rag hid the wound in his throat. I told him I should\r\nkill the cat when I came across her, but he only shook his head and\r\nturned to the open ledger before him. He read name after name of the\r\npeople who had come to him in regard to their reputation, and the sums\r\nhe had amassed were startling.\r\n\r\n“I put on the screws now and then,” he explained.\r\n\r\n“One day or other some of these people will assassinate you,” I\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?” he said, rubbing his mutilated ears.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to argue with him, so I took down the manuscript\r\nentitled Imperial Dynasty of America, for the last time I should\r\never take it down in Mr. Wilde’s study. I read it through, thrilling\r\nand trembling with pleasure. When I had finished Mr. Wilde took the\r\nmanuscript and, turning to the dark passage which leads from his study\r\nto his bed-chamber, called out in a loud voice, “Vance.” Then for the\r\nfirst time, I noticed a man crouching there in the shadow. How I had\r\noverlooked him during my search for the cat, I cannot imagine.\r\n\r\n“Vance, come in,” cried Mr. Wilde.\r\n\r\nThe figure rose and crept towards us, and I shall never forget the face\r\nthat he raised to mine, as the light from the window illuminated it.\r\n\r\n“Vance, this is Mr. Castaigne,” said Mr. Wilde. Before he had finished\r\nspeaking, the man threw himself on the ground before the table, crying\r\nand grasping, “Oh, God! Oh, my God! Help me! Forgive me! Oh, Mr.\r\nCastaigne, keep that man away. You cannot, you cannot mean it! You are\r\ndifferent—save me! I am broken down—I was in a madhouse and now—when\r\nall was coming right—when I had forgotten the King—the King in Yellow\r\nand—but I shall go mad again—I shall go mad—”\r\n\r\nHis voice died into a choking rattle, for Mr. Wilde had leapt on him\r\nand his right hand encircled the man’s throat. When Vance fell in a\r\nheap on the floor, Mr. Wilde clambered nimbly into his chair again, and\r\nrubbing his mangled ears with the stump of his hand, turned to me and\r\nasked me for the ledger. I reached it down from the shelf and he opened\r\nit. After a moment’s searching among the beautifully written pages, he\r\ncoughed complacently, and pointed to the name Vance.\r\n\r\n“Vance,” he read aloud, “Osgood Oswald Vance.” At the sound of his\r\nname, the man on the floor raised his head and turned a convulsed face\r\nto Mr. Wilde. His eyes were injected with blood, his lips tumefied.\r\n“Called April 28th,” continued Mr. Wilde. “Occupation, cashier in the\r\nSeaforth National Bank; has served a term of forgery at Sing Sing,\r\nfrom whence he was transferred to the Asylum for the Criminal Insane.\r\nPardoned by the Governor of New York, and discharged from the Asylum,\r\nJanuary 19, 1918. Reputation damaged at Sheepshead Bay. Rumours that he\r\nlives beyond his income. Reputation to be repaired at once. Retainer\r\n$1,500.\r\n\r\n“Note.—Has embezzled sums amounting to $30,000 since March 20,\r\n1919, excellent family, and secured present position through uncle’s\r\ninfluence. Father, President of Seaforth Bank.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the man on the floor.\r\n\r\n“Get up, Vance,” said Mr. Wilde in a gentle voice. Vance rose as if\r\nhypnotized. “He will do as we suggest now,” observed Mr. Wilde, and\r\nopening the manuscript, he read the entire history of the Imperial\r\nDynasty of America. Then in a kind and soothing murmur he ran over\r\nthe important points with Vance, who stood like one stunned. His eyes\r\nwere so blank and vacant that I imagined he had become half-witted,\r\nand remarked it to Mr. Wilde who replied that it was of no consequence\r\nanyway. Very patiently we pointed out to Vance what his share in\r\nthe affair would be, and he seemed to understand after a while. Mr.\r\nWilde explained the manuscript, using several volumes on Heraldry,\r\nto substantiate the result of his researches. He mentioned the\r\nestablishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected\r\nHastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda\r\nand Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of\r\nHali. “The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill\r\nforever,” he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by\r\ndegrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family,\r\nto Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and\r\nthen tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful\r\nstory of the Last King. Fascinated and thrilled I watched him. He threw\r\nup his head, his long arms were stretched out in a magnificent gesture\r\nof pride and power, and his eyes blazed deep in their sockets like two\r\nemeralds. Vance listened stupefied. As for me, when at last Mr. Wilde\r\nhad finished, and pointing to me, cried, “The cousin of the King!” my\r\nhead swam with excitement.\r\n\r\nControlling myself with a superhuman effort, I explained to Vance why\r\nI alone was worthy of the crown and why my cousin must be exiled or\r\ndie. I made him understand that my cousin must never marry, even after\r\nrenouncing all his claims, and how that least of all he should marry\r\nthe daughter of the Marquis of Avonshire and bring England into the\r\nquestion. I showed him a list of thousands of names which Mr. Wilde had\r\ndrawn up; every man whose name was there had received the Yellow Sign\r\nwhich no living human being dared disregard. The city, the state, the\r\nwhole land, were ready to rise and tremble before the Pallid Mask.\r\n\r\nThe time had come, the people should know the son of Hastur, and the\r\nwhole world bow to the black stars which hang in the sky over Carcosa.\r\n\r\nVance leaned on the table, his head buried in his hands. Mr. Wilde drew\r\na rough sketch on the margin of yesterday’s _Herald_ with a bit of lead\r\npencil. It was a plan of Hawberk’s rooms. Then he wrote out the order\r\nand affixed the seal, and shaking like a palsied man I signed my first\r\nwrit of execution with my name Hildred-Rex.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilde clambered to the floor and unlocking the cabinet, took a\r\nlong square box from the first shelf. This he brought to the table and\r\nopened. A new knife lay in the tissue paper inside and I picked it up\r\nand handed it to Vance, along with the order and the plan of Hawberk’s\r\napartment. Then Mr. Wilde told Vance he could go; and he went,\r\nshambling like an outcast of the slums.\r\n\r\nI sat for a while watching the daylight fade behind the square tower of\r\nthe Judson Memorial Church, and finally, gathering up the manuscript\r\nand notes, took my hat and started for the door.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilde watched me in silence. When I had stepped into the hall I\r\nlooked back. Mr. Wilde’s small eyes were still fixed on me. Behind him,\r\nthe shadows gathered in the fading light. Then I closed the door behind\r\nme and went out into the darkening streets.\r\n\r\nI had eaten nothing since breakfast, but I was not hungry. A wretched,\r\nhalf-starved creature, who stood looking across the street at the\r\nLethal Chamber, noticed me and came up to tell me a tale of misery. I\r\ngave him money, I don’t know why, and he went away without thanking me.\r\nAn hour later another outcast approached and whined his story. I had a\r\nblank bit of paper in my pocket, on which was traced the Yellow Sign,\r\nand I handed it to him. He looked at it stupidly for a moment, and\r\nthen with an uncertain glance at me, folded it with what seemed to me\r\nexaggerated care and placed it in his bosom.\r\n\r\nThe electric lights were sparkling among the trees, and the new moon\r\nshone in the sky above the Lethal Chamber. It was tiresome waiting in\r\nthe square; I wandered from the Marble Arch to the artillery stables\r\nand back again to the lotos fountain. The flowers and grass exhaled\r\na fragrance which troubled me. The jet of the fountain played in\r\nthe moonlight, and the musical splash of falling drops reminded me\r\nof the tinkle of chained mail in Hawberk’s shop. But it was not so\r\nfascinating, and the dull sparkle of the moonlight on the water brought\r\nno such sensations of exquisite pleasure, as when the sunshine played\r\nover the polished steel of a corselet on Hawberk’s knee. I watched the\r\nbats darting and turning above the water plants in the fountain basin,\r\nbut their rapid, jerky flight set my nerves on edge, and I went away\r\nagain to walk aimlessly to and fro among the trees.\r\n\r\nThe artillery stables were dark, but in the cavalry barracks the\r\nofficers’ windows were brilliantly lighted, and the sallyport was\r\nconstantly filled with troopers in fatigue, carrying straw and harness\r\nand baskets filled with tin dishes.\r\n\r\nTwice the mounted sentry at the gates was changed while I wandered up\r\nand down the asphalt walk. I looked at my watch. It was nearly time.\r\nThe lights in the barracks went out one by one, the barred gate was\r\nclosed, and every minute or two an officer passed in through the side\r\nwicket, leaving a rattle of accoutrements and a jingle of spurs on\r\nthe night air. The square had become very silent. The last homeless\r\nloiterer had been driven away by the grey-coated park policeman, the\r\ncar tracks along Wooster Street were deserted, and the only sound which\r\nbroke the stillness was the stamping of the sentry’s horse and the ring\r\nof his sabre against the saddle pommel. In the barracks, the officers’\r\nquarters were still lighted, and military servants passed and repassed\r\nbefore the bay windows. Twelve o’clock sounded from the new spire of\r\nSt. Francis Xavier, and at the last stroke of the sad-toned bell a\r\nfigure passed through the wicket beside the portcullis, returned the\r\nsalute of the sentry, and crossing the street entered the square and\r\nadvanced toward the Benedick apartment house.\r\n\r\n“Louis,” I called.\r\n\r\nThe man pivoted on his spurred heels and came straight toward me.\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Hildred?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are on time.”\r\n\r\nI took his offered hand, and we strolled toward the Lethal Chamber.\r\n\r\nHe rattled on about his wedding and the graces of Constance, and\r\ntheir future prospects, calling my attention to his captain’s\r\nshoulder-straps, and the triple gold arabesque on his sleeve and\r\nfatigue cap. I believe I listened as much to the music of his spurs\r\nand sabre as I did to his boyish babble, and at last we stood under\r\nthe elms on the Fourth Street corner of the square opposite the\r\nLethal Chamber. Then he laughed and asked me what I wanted with him.\r\nI motioned him to a seat on a bench under the electric light, and sat\r\ndown beside him. He looked at me curiously, with that same searching\r\nglance which I hate and fear so in doctors. I felt the insult of his\r\nlook, but he did not know it, and I carefully concealed my feelings.\r\n\r\n“Well, old chap,” he inquired, “what can I do for you?”\r\n\r\nI drew from my pocket the manuscript and notes of the Imperial Dynasty\r\nof America, and looking him in the eye said:\r\n\r\n“I will tell you. On your word as a soldier, promise me to read this\r\nmanuscript from beginning to end, without asking me a question. Promise\r\nme to read these notes in the same way, and promise me to listen to\r\nwhat I have to tell later.”\r\n\r\n“I promise, if you wish it,” he said pleasantly. “Give me the paper,\r\nHildred.”\r\n\r\nHe began to read, raising his eyebrows with a puzzled, whimsical air,\r\nwhich made me tremble with suppressed anger. As he advanced, his\r\neyebrows contracted, and his lips seemed to form the word “rubbish.”\r\n\r\nThen he looked slightly bored, but apparently for my sake read, with an\r\nattempt at interest, which presently ceased to be an effort. He started\r\nwhen in the closely written pages he came to his own name, and when\r\nhe came to mine he lowered the paper, and looked sharply at me for a\r\nmoment. But he kept his word, and resumed his reading, and I let the\r\nhalf-formed question die on his lips unanswered. When he came to the\r\nend and read the signature of Mr. Wilde, he folded the paper carefully\r\nand returned it to me. I handed him the notes, and he settled back,\r\npushing his fatigue cap up to his forehead, with a boyish gesture,\r\nwhich I remembered so well in school. I watched his face as he read,\r\nand when he finished I took the notes with the manuscript, and placed\r\nthem in my pocket. Then I unfolded a scroll marked with the Yellow\r\nSign. He saw the sign, but he did not seem to recognize it, and I\r\ncalled his attention to it somewhat sharply.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “I see it. What is it?”\r\n\r\n“It is the Yellow Sign,” I said angrily.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s it, is it?” said Louis, in that flattering voice, which\r\nDoctor Archer used to employ with me, and would probably have employed\r\nagain, had I not settled his affair for him.\r\n\r\nI kept my rage down and answered as steadily as possible, “Listen, you\r\nhave engaged your word?”\r\n\r\n“I am listening, old chap,” he replied soothingly.\r\n\r\nI began to speak very calmly.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Archer, having by some means become possessed of the secret of the\r\nImperial Succession, attempted to deprive me of my right, alleging that\r\nbecause of a fall from my horse four years ago, I had become mentally\r\ndeficient. He presumed to place me under restraint in his own house in\r\nhopes of either driving me insane or poisoning me. I have not forgotten\r\nit. I visited him last night and the interview was final.”\r\n\r\nLouis turned quite pale, but did not move. I resumed triumphantly,\r\n“There are yet three people to be interviewed in the interests of\r\nMr. Wilde and myself. They are my cousin Louis, Mr. Hawberk, and his\r\ndaughter Constance.”\r\n\r\nLouis sprang to his feet and I arose also, and flung the paper marked\r\nwith the Yellow Sign to the ground.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t need that to tell you what I have to say,” I cried, with a\r\nlaugh of triumph. “You must renounce the crown to me, do you hear, to\r\n_me_.”\r\n\r\nLouis looked at me with a startled air, but recovering himself said\r\nkindly, “Of course I renounce the—what is it I must renounce?”\r\n\r\n“The crown,” I said angrily.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he answered, “I renounce it. Come, old chap, I’ll walk\r\nback to your rooms with you.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t try any of your doctor’s tricks on me,” I cried, trembling with\r\nfury. “Don’t act as if you think I am insane.”\r\n\r\n“What nonsense,” he replied. “Come, it’s getting late, Hildred.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I shouted, “you must listen. You cannot marry, I forbid it. Do\r\nyou hear? I forbid it. You shall renounce the crown, and in reward I\r\ngrant you exile, but if you refuse you shall die.”\r\n\r\nHe tried to calm me, but I was roused at last, and drawing my long\r\nknife barred his way.\r\n\r\nThen I told him how they would find Dr. Archer in the cellar with his\r\nthroat open, and I laughed in his face when I thought of Vance and his\r\nknife, and the order signed by me.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you are the King,” I cried, “but I shall be King. Who are you to\r\nkeep me from Empire over all the habitable earth! I was born the cousin\r\nof a king, but I shall be King!”\r\n\r\nLouis stood white and rigid before me. Suddenly a man came running up\r\nFourth Street, entered the gate of the Lethal Temple, traversed the\r\npath to the bronze doors at full speed, and plunged into the death\r\nchamber with the cry of one demented, and I laughed until I wept tears,\r\nfor I had recognized Vance, and knew that Hawberk and his daughter were\r\nno longer in my way.\r\n\r\n“Go,” I cried to Louis, “you have ceased to be a menace. You will never\r\nmarry Constance now, and if you marry any one else in your exile, I\r\nwill visit you as I did my doctor last night. Mr. Wilde takes charge of\r\nyou to-morrow.” Then I turned and darted into South Fifth Avenue, and\r\nwith a cry of terror Louis dropped his belt and sabre and followed me\r\nlike the wind. I heard him close behind me at the corner of Bleecker\r\nStreet, and I dashed into the doorway under Hawberk’s sign. He cried,\r\n“Halt, or I fire!” but when he saw that I flew up the stairs leaving\r\nHawberk’s shop below, he left me, and I heard him hammering and\r\nshouting at their door as though it were possible to arouse the dead.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilde’s door was open, and I entered crying, “It is done, it is\r\ndone! Let the nations rise and look upon their King!” but I could not\r\nfind Mr. Wilde, so I went to the cabinet and took the splendid diadem\r\nfrom its case. Then I drew on the white silk robe, embroidered with the\r\nYellow Sign, and placed the crown upon my head. At last I was King,\r\nKing by my right in Hastur, King because I knew the mystery of the\r\nHyades, and my mind had sounded the depths of the Lake of Hali. I was\r\nKing! The first grey pencillings of dawn would raise a tempest which\r\nwould shake two hemispheres. Then as I stood, my every nerve pitched to\r\nthe highest tension, faint with the joy and splendour of my thought,\r\nwithout, in the dark passage, a man groaned.\r\n\r\nI seized the tallow dip and sprang to the door. The cat passed me like\r\na demon, and the tallow dip went out, but my long knife flew swifter\r\nthan she, and I heard her screech, and I knew that my knife had found\r\nher. For a moment I listened to her tumbling and thumping about in the\r\ndarkness, and then when her frenzy ceased, I lighted a lamp and raised\r\nit over my head. Mr. Wilde lay on the floor with his throat torn open.\r\nAt first I thought he was dead, but as I looked, a green sparkle came\r\ninto his sunken eyes, his mutilated hand trembled, and then a spasm\r\nstretched his mouth from ear to ear. For a moment my terror and despair\r\ngave place to hope, but as I bent over him his eyeballs rolled clean\r\naround in his head, and he died. Then while I stood, transfixed with\r\nrage and despair, seeing my crown, my empire, every hope and every\r\nambition, my very life, lying prostrate there with the dead master,\r\n_they_ came, seized me from behind, and bound me until my veins stood\r\nout like cords, and my voice failed with the paroxysms of my frenzied\r\nscreams. But I still raged, bleeding and infuriated among them, and\r\nmore than one policeman felt my sharp teeth. Then when I could no\r\nlonger move they came nearer; I saw old Hawberk, and behind him my\r\ncousin Louis’ ghastly face, and farther away, in the corner, a woman,\r\nConstance, weeping softly.\r\n\r\n“Ah! I see it now!” I shrieked. “You have seized the throne and the\r\nempire. Woe! woe to you who are crowned with the crown of the King in\r\nYellow!”\r\n\r\n[EDITOR’S NOTE.—Mr. Castaigne died yesterday in the Asylum for\r\nCriminal Insane.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE MASK\r\n\r\n\r\n  CAMILLA: You, sir, should unmask.\r\n\r\n  STRANGER: Indeed?\r\n\r\n  CASSILDA: Indeed it’s time. We all have laid aside disguise but you.\r\n\r\n  STRANGER: I wear no mask.\r\n\r\n  CAMILLA: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda.) No mask? No mask!\r\n\r\n              _The King in Yellow, Act I, Scene 2_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nAlthough I knew nothing of chemistry, I listened fascinated. He picked\r\nup an Easter lily which Geneviève had brought that morning from\r\nNotre Dame, and dropped it into the basin. Instantly the liquid lost\r\nits crystalline clearness. For a second the lily was enveloped in a\r\nmilk-white foam, which disappeared, leaving the fluid opalescent.\r\nChanging tints of orange and crimson played over the surface, and\r\nthen what seemed to be a ray of pure sunlight struck through from the\r\nbottom where the lily was resting. At the same instant he plunged his\r\nhand into the basin and drew out the flower. “There is no danger,” he\r\nexplained, “if you choose the right moment. That golden ray is the\r\nsignal.”\r\n\r\nHe held the lily toward me, and I took it in my hand. It had turned to\r\nstone, to the purest marble.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he said, “it is without a flaw. What sculptor could\r\nreproduce it?”\r\n\r\nThe marble was white as snow, but in its depths the veins of the lily\r\nwere tinged with palest azure, and a faint flush lingered deep in its\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n“Don’t ask me the reason of that,” he smiled, noticing my wonder. “I\r\nhave no idea why the veins and heart are tinted, but they always are.\r\nYesterday I tried one of Geneviève’s gold-fish,—there it is.”\r\n\r\nThe fish looked as if sculptured in marble. But if you held it to the\r\nlight the stone was beautifully veined with a faint blue, and from\r\nsomewhere within came a rosy light like the tint which slumbers in an\r\nopal. I looked into the basin. Once more it seemed filled with clearest\r\ncrystal.\r\n\r\n“If I should touch it now?” I demanded.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” he replied, “but you had better not try.”\r\n\r\n“There is one thing I’m curious about,” I said, “and that is where the\r\nray of sunlight came from.”\r\n\r\n“It looked like a sunbeam true enough,” he said. “I don’t know, it\r\nalways comes when I immerse any living thing. Perhaps,” he continued,\r\nsmiling, “perhaps it is the vital spark of the creature escaping to the\r\nsource from whence it came.”\r\n\r\nI saw he was mocking, and threatened him with a mahl-stick, but he only\r\nlaughed and changed the subject.\r\n\r\n“Stay to lunch. Geneviève will be here directly.”\r\n\r\n“I saw her going to early mass,” I said, “and she looked as fresh and\r\nsweet as that lily—before you destroyed it.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I destroyed it?” said Boris gravely.\r\n\r\n“Destroyed, preserved, how can we tell?”\r\n\r\nWe sat in the corner of a studio near his unfinished group of the\r\n“Fates.” He leaned back on the sofa, twirling a sculptor’s chisel and\r\nsquinting at his work.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” he said, “I have finished pointing up that old academic\r\nAriadne, and I suppose it will have to go to the Salon. It’s all I have\r\nready this year, but after the success the ‘Madonna’ brought me I feel\r\nashamed to send a thing like that.”\r\n\r\nThe “Madonna,” an exquisite marble for which Geneviève had sat, had\r\nbeen the sensation of last year’s Salon. I looked at the Ariadne. It\r\nwas a magnificent piece of technical work, but I agreed with Boris\r\nthat the world would expect something better of him than that. Still,\r\nit was impossible now to think of finishing in time for the Salon that\r\nsplendid terrible group half shrouded in the marble behind me. The\r\n“Fates” would have to wait.\r\n\r\nWe were proud of Boris Yvain. We claimed him and he claimed us on the\r\nstrength of his having been born in America, although his father was\r\nFrench and his mother was a Russian. Every one in the Beaux Arts called\r\nhim Boris. And yet there were only two of us whom he addressed in the\r\nsame familiar way—Jack Scott and myself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my being in love with Geneviève had something to do with his\r\naffection for me. Not that it had ever been acknowledged between us.\r\nBut after all was settled, and she had told me with tears in her\r\neyes that it was Boris whom she loved, I went over to his house and\r\ncongratulated him. The perfect cordiality of that interview did not\r\ndeceive either of us, I always believed, although to one at least it\r\nwas a great comfort. I do not think he and Geneviève ever spoke of the\r\nmatter together, but Boris knew.\r\n\r\nGeneviève was lovely. The Madonna-like purity of her face might have\r\nbeen inspired by the Sanctus in Gounod’s Mass. But I was always glad\r\nwhen she changed that mood for what we called her “April Manœuvres.”\r\nShe was often as variable as an April day. In the morning grave,\r\ndignified and sweet, at noon laughing, capricious, at evening whatever\r\none least expected. I preferred her so rather than in that Madonna-like\r\ntranquillity which stirred the depths of my heart. I was dreaming of\r\nGeneviève when he spoke again.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of my discovery, Alec?”\r\n\r\n“I think it wonderful.”\r\n\r\n“I shall make no use of it, you know, beyond satisfying my own\r\ncuriosity so far as may be, and the secret will die with me.”\r\n\r\n“It would be rather a blow to sculpture, would it not? We painters lose\r\nmore than we ever gain by photography.”\r\n\r\nBoris nodded, playing with the edge of the chisel.\r\n\r\n“This new vicious discovery would corrupt the world of art. No, I shall\r\nnever confide the secret to any one,” he said slowly.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to find any one less informed about such phenomena\r\nthan myself; but of course I had heard of mineral springs so saturated\r\nwith silica that the leaves and twigs which fell into them were turned\r\nto stone after a time. I dimly comprehended the process, how the\r\nsilica replaced the vegetable matter, atom by atom, and the result\r\nwas a duplicate of the object in stone. This, I confess, had never\r\ninterested me greatly, and as for the ancient fossils thus produced,\r\nthey disgusted me. Boris, it appeared, feeling curiosity instead of\r\nrepugnance, had investigated the subject, and had accidentally stumbled\r\non a solution which, attacking the immersed object with a ferocity\r\nunheard of, in a second did the work of years. This was all I could\r\nmake out of the strange story he had just been telling me. He spoke\r\nagain after a long silence.\r\n\r\n“I am almost frightened when I think what I have found. Scientists\r\nwould go mad over the discovery. It was so simple too; it discovered\r\nitself. When I think of that formula, and that new element precipitated\r\nin metallic scales—”\r\n\r\n“What new element?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I haven’t thought of naming it, and I don’t believe I ever shall.\r\nThere are enough precious metals now in the world to cut throats over.”\r\n\r\nI pricked up my ears. “Have you struck gold, Boris?”\r\n\r\n“No, better;—but see here, Alec!” he laughed, starting up. “You and I\r\nhave all we need in this world. Ah! how sinister and covetous you look\r\nalready!” I laughed too, and told him I was devoured by the desire for\r\ngold, and we had better talk of something else; so when Geneviève came\r\nin shortly after, we had turned our backs on alchemy.\r\n\r\nGeneviève was dressed in silvery grey from head to foot. The light\r\nglinted along the soft curves of her fair hair as she turned her cheek\r\nto Boris; then she saw me and returned my greeting. She had never\r\nbefore failed to blow me a kiss from the tips of her white fingers,\r\nand I promptly complained of the omission. She smiled and held out her\r\nhand, which dropped almost before it had touched mine; then she said,\r\nlooking at Boris—\r\n\r\n“You must ask Alec to stay for luncheon.” This also was something new.\r\nShe had always asked me herself until to-day.\r\n\r\n“I did,” said Boris shortly.\r\n\r\n“And you said yes, I hope?” She turned to me with a charming\r\nconventional smile. I might have been an acquaintance of the day before\r\nyesterday. I made her a low bow. “J’avais bien l’honneur, madame,” but\r\nrefusing to take up our usual bantering tone, she murmured a hospitable\r\ncommonplace and disappeared. Boris and I looked at one another.\r\n\r\n“I had better go home, don’t you think?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Hanged if I know,” he replied frankly.\r\n\r\nWhile we were discussing the advisability of my departure Geneviève\r\nreappeared in the doorway without her bonnet. She was wonderfully\r\nbeautiful, but her colour was too deep and her lovely eyes were too\r\nbright. She came straight up to me and took my arm.\r\n\r\n“Luncheon is ready. Was I cross, Alec? I thought I had a headache, but\r\nI haven’t. Come here, Boris;” and she slipped her other arm through\r\nhis. “Alec knows that after you there is no one in the world whom I\r\nlike as well as I like him, so if he sometimes feels snubbed it won’t\r\nhurt him.”\r\n\r\n“À la bonheur!” I cried, “who says there are no thunderstorms in April?”\r\n\r\n“Are you ready?” chanted Boris. “Aye ready;” and arm-in-arm we raced\r\ninto the dining-room, scandalizing the servants. After all we were not\r\nso much to blame; Geneviève was eighteen, Boris was twenty-three, and I\r\nnot quite twenty-one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nSome work that I was doing about this time on the decorations for\r\nGeneviève’s boudoir kept me constantly at the quaint little hotel in\r\nthe Rue Sainte-Cécile. Boris and I in those days laboured hard but as\r\nwe pleased, which was fitfully, and we all three, with Jack Scott,\r\nidled a great deal together.\r\n\r\nOne quiet afternoon I had been wandering alone over the house examining\r\ncurios, prying into odd corners, bringing out sweetmeats and cigars\r\nfrom strange hiding-places, and at last I stopped in the bathing-room.\r\nBoris, all over clay, stood there washing his hands.\r\n\r\nThe room was built of rose-coloured marble excepting the floor,\r\nwhich was tessellated in rose and grey. In the centre was a square\r\npool sunken below the surface of the floor; steps led down into it,\r\nsculptured pillars supported a frescoed ceiling. A delicious marble\r\nCupid appeared to have just alighted on his pedestal at the upper end\r\nof the room. The whole interior was Boris’ work and mine. Boris, in his\r\nworking-clothes of white canvas, scraped the traces of clay and red\r\nmodelling wax from his handsome hands, and coquetted over his shoulder\r\nwith the Cupid.\r\n\r\n“I see you,” he insisted, “don’t try to look the other way and pretend\r\nnot to see me. You know who made you, little humbug!”\r\n\r\nIt was always my rôle to interpret Cupid’s sentiments in these\r\nconversations, and when my turn came I responded in such a manner, that\r\nBoris seized my arm and dragged me toward the pool, declaring he would\r\nduck me. Next instant he dropped my arm and turned pale. “Good God!” he\r\nsaid, “I forgot the pool is full of the solution!”\r\n\r\nI shivered a little, and dryly advised him to remember better where he\r\nhad stored the precious liquid.\r\n\r\n“In Heaven’s name, why do you keep a small lake of that gruesome stuff\r\nhere of all places?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I want to experiment on something large,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“On me, for instance?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that came too close for jesting; but I do want to watch the action\r\nof that solution on a more highly organized living body; there is that\r\nbig white rabbit,” he said, following me into the studio.\r\n\r\nJack Scott, wearing a paint-stained jacket, came wandering in,\r\nappropriated all the Oriental sweetmeats he could lay his hands on,\r\nlooted the cigarette case, and finally he and Boris disappeared\r\ntogether to visit the Luxembourg Gallery, where a new silver bronze by\r\nRodin and a landscape of Monet’s were claiming the exclusive attention\r\nof artistic France. I went back to the studio, and resumed my work.\r\nIt was a Renaissance screen, which Boris wanted me to paint for\r\nGeneviève’s boudoir. But the small boy who was unwillingly dawdling\r\nthrough a series of poses for it, to-day refused all bribes to be good.\r\nHe never rested an instant in the same position, and inside of five\r\nminutes I had as many different outlines of the little beggar.\r\n\r\n“Are you posing, or are you executing a song and dance, my friend?” I\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n“Whichever monsieur pleases,” he replied, with an angelic smile.\r\n\r\nOf course I dismissed him for the day, and of course I paid him for the\r\nfull time, that being the way we spoil our models.\r\n\r\nAfter the young imp had gone, I made a few perfunctory daubs at my\r\nwork, but was so thoroughly out of humour, that it took me the rest\r\nof the afternoon to undo the damage I had done, so at last I scraped\r\nmy palette, stuck my brushes in a bowl of black soap, and strolled\r\ninto the smoking-room. I really believe that, excepting Geneviève’s\r\napartments, no room in the house was so free from the perfume of\r\ntobacco as this one. It was a queer chaos of odds and ends, hung with\r\nthreadbare tapestry. A sweet-toned old spinet in good repair stood by\r\nthe window. There were stands of weapons, some old and dull, others\r\nbright and modern, festoons of Indian and Turkish armour over the\r\nmantel, two or three good pictures, and a pipe-rack. It was here that\r\nwe used to come for new sensations in smoking. I doubt if any type of\r\npipe ever existed which was not represented in that rack. When we had\r\nselected one, we immediately carried it somewhere else and smoked it;\r\nfor the place was, on the whole, more gloomy and less inviting than any\r\nin the house. But this afternoon, the twilight was very soothing, the\r\nrugs and skins on the floor looked brown and soft and drowsy; the big\r\ncouch was piled with cushions—I found my pipe and curled up there for\r\nan unaccustomed smoke in the smoking-room. I had chosen one with a long\r\nflexible stem, and lighting it fell to dreaming. After a while it went\r\nout, but I did not stir. I dreamed on and presently fell asleep.\r\n\r\nI awoke to the saddest music I had ever heard. The room was quite dark,\r\nI had no idea what time it was. A ray of moonlight silvered one edge\r\nof the old spinet, and the polished wood seemed to exhale the sounds\r\nas perfume floats above a box of sandalwood. Some one rose in the\r\ndarkness, and came away weeping quietly, and I was fool enough to cry\r\nout “Geneviève!”\r\n\r\nShe dropped at my voice, and, I had time to curse myself while I made\r\na light and tried to raise her from the floor. She shrank away with a\r\nmurmur of pain. She was very quiet, and asked for Boris. I carried her\r\nto the divan, and went to look for him, but he was not in the house,\r\nand the servants were gone to bed. Perplexed and anxious, I hurried\r\nback to Geneviève. She lay where I had left her, looking very white.\r\n\r\n“I can’t find Boris nor any of the servants,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I know,” she answered faintly, “Boris has gone to Ept with Mr. Scott.\r\nI did not remember when I sent you for him just now.”\r\n\r\n“But he can’t get back in that case before to-morrow afternoon,\r\nand—are you hurt? Did I frighten you into falling? What an awful fool\r\nI am, but I was only half awake.”\r\n\r\n“Boris thought you had gone home before dinner. Do please excuse us for\r\nletting you stay here all this time.”\r\n\r\n“I have had a long nap,” I laughed, “so sound that I did not know\r\nwhether I was still asleep or not when I found myself staring at a\r\nfigure that was moving toward me, and called out your name. Have you\r\nbeen trying the old spinet? You must have played very softly.”\r\n\r\nI would tell a thousand more lies worse than that one to see the look\r\nof relief that came into her face. She smiled adorably, and said in her\r\nnatural voice: “Alec, I tripped on that wolf’s head, and I think my\r\nankle is sprained. Please call Marie, and then go home.”\r\n\r\nI did as she bade me, and left her there when the maid came in.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nAt noon next day when I called, I found Boris walking restlessly about\r\nhis studio.\r\n\r\n“Geneviève is asleep just now,” he told me, “the sprain is nothing, but\r\nwhy should she have such a high fever? The doctor can’t account for it;\r\nor else he will not,” he muttered.\r\n\r\n“Geneviève has a fever?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I should say so, and has actually been a little light-headed at\r\nintervals all night. The idea! gay little Geneviève, without a care in\r\nthe world,—and she keeps saying her heart’s broken, and she wants to\r\ndie!”\r\n\r\nMy own heart stood still.\r\n\r\nBoris leaned against the door of his studio, looking down, his hands\r\nin his pockets, his kind, keen eyes clouded, a new line of trouble\r\ndrawn “over the mouth’s good mark, that made the smile.” The maid had\r\norders to summon him the instant Geneviève opened her eyes. We waited\r\nand waited, and Boris, growing restless, wandered about, fussing with\r\nmodelling wax and red clay. Suddenly he started for the next room.\r\n“Come and see my rose-coloured bath full of death!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Is it death?” I asked, to humour his mood.\r\n\r\n“You are not prepared to call it life, I suppose,” he answered. As\r\nhe spoke he plucked a solitary gold-fish squirming and twisting out\r\nof its globe. “We’ll send this one after the other—wherever that\r\nis,” he said. There was feverish excitement in his voice. A dull\r\nweight of fever lay on my limbs and on my brain as I followed him to\r\nthe fair crystal pool with its pink-tinted sides; and he dropped the\r\ncreature in. Falling, its scales flashed with a hot orange gleam in\r\nits angry twistings and contortions; the moment it struck the liquid\r\nit became rigid and sank heavily to the bottom. Then came the milky\r\nfoam, the splendid hues radiating on the surface and then the shaft\r\nof pure serene light broke through from seemingly infinite depths.\r\nBoris plunged in his hand and drew out an exquisite marble thing,\r\nblue-veined, rose-tinted, and glistening with opalescent drops.\r\n\r\n“Child’s play,” he muttered, and looked wearily, longingly at me,—as\r\nif I could answer such questions! But Jack Scott came in and entered\r\ninto the “game,” as he called it, with ardour. Nothing would do but to\r\ntry the experiment on the white rabbit then and there. I was willing\r\nthat Boris should find distraction from his cares, but I hated to\r\nsee the life go out of a warm, living creature and I declined to be\r\npresent. Picking up a book at random, I sat down in the studio to read.\r\nAlas! I had found _The King in Yellow_. After a few moments, which\r\nseemed ages, I was putting it away with a nervous shudder, when Boris\r\nand Jack came in bringing their marble rabbit. At the same time the\r\nbell rang above, and a cry came from the sick-room. Boris was gone like\r\na flash, and the next moment he called, “Jack, run for the doctor;\r\nbring him back with you. Alec, come here.”\r\n\r\nI went and stood at her door. A frightened maid came out in haste and\r\nran away to fetch some remedy. Geneviève, sitting bolt upright, with\r\ncrimson cheeks and glittering eyes, babbled incessantly and resisted\r\nBoris’ gentle restraint. He called me to help. At my first touch she\r\nsighed and sank back, closing her eyes, and then—then—as we still\r\nbent above her, she opened them again, looked straight into Boris’\r\nface—poor fever-crazed girl!—and told her secret. At the same instant\r\nour three lives turned into new channels; the bond that held us so\r\nlong together snapped for ever and a new bond was forged in its place,\r\nfor she had spoken my name, and as the fever tortured her, her heart\r\npoured out its load of hidden sorrow. Amazed and dumb I bowed my head,\r\nwhile my face burned like a live coal, and the blood surged in my\r\nears, stupefying me with its clamour. Incapable of movement, incapable\r\nof speech, I listened to her feverish words in an agony of shame and\r\nsorrow. I could not silence her, I could not look at Boris. Then I felt\r\nan arm upon my shoulder, and Boris turned a bloodless face to mine.\r\n\r\n“It is not your fault, Alec; don’t grieve so if she loves you—” but\r\nhe could not finish; and as the doctor stepped swiftly into the room,\r\nsaying—“Ah, the fever!” I seized Jack Scott and hurried him to the\r\nstreet, saying, “Boris would rather be alone.” We crossed the street\r\nto our own apartments, and that night, seeing I was going to be ill\r\ntoo, he went for the doctor again. The last thing I recollect with any\r\ndistinctness was hearing Jack say, “For Heaven’s sake, doctor, what\r\nails him, to wear a face like that?” and I thought of _The King in\r\nYellow_ and the Pallid Mask.\r\n\r\nI was very ill, for the strain of two years which I had endured since\r\nthat fatal May morning when Geneviève murmured, “I love you, but I\r\nthink I love Boris best,” told on me at last. I had never imagined that\r\nit could become more than I could endure. Outwardly tranquil, I had\r\ndeceived myself. Although the inward battle raged night after night,\r\nand I, lying alone in my room, cursed myself for rebellious thoughts\r\nunloyal to Boris and unworthy of Geneviève, the morning always brought\r\nrelief, and I returned to Geneviève and to my dear Boris with a heart\r\nwashed clean by the tempests of the night.\r\n\r\nNever in word or deed or thought while with them had I betrayed my\r\nsorrow even to myself.\r\n\r\nThe mask of self-deception was no longer a mask for me, it was a part\r\nof me. Night lifted it, laying bare the stifled truth below; but there\r\nwas no one to see except myself, and when the day broke the mask fell\r\nback again of its own accord. These thoughts passed through my troubled\r\nmind as I lay sick, but they were hopelessly entangled with visions of\r\nwhite creatures, heavy as stone, crawling about in Boris’ basin,—of\r\nthe wolf’s head on the rug, foaming and snapping at Geneviève, who\r\nlay smiling beside it. I thought, too, of the King in Yellow wrapped\r\nin the fantastic colours of his tattered mantle, and that bitter\r\ncry of Cassilda, “Not upon us, oh King, not upon us!” Feverishly I\r\nstruggled to put it from me, but I saw the lake of Hali, thin and\r\nblank, without a ripple or wind to stir it, and I saw the towers of\r\nCarcosa behind the moon. Aldebaran, the Hyades, Alar, Hastur, glided\r\nthrough the cloud-rifts which fluttered and flapped as they passed\r\nlike the scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow. Among all these,\r\none sane thought persisted. It never wavered, no matter what else was\r\ngoing on in my disordered mind, that my chief reason for existing was\r\nto meet some requirement of Boris and Geneviève. What this obligation\r\nwas, its nature, was never clear; sometimes it seemed to be protection,\r\nsometimes support, through a great crisis. Whatever it seemed to be\r\nfor the time, its weight rested only on me, and I was never so ill or\r\nso weak that I did not respond with my whole soul. There were always\r\ncrowds of faces about me, mostly strange, but a few I recognized, Boris\r\namong them. Afterward they told me that this could not have been, but I\r\nknow that once at least he bent over me. It was only a touch, a faint\r\necho of his voice, then the clouds settled back on my senses, and I\r\nlost him, but he _did_ stand there and bend over me _once_ at least.\r\n\r\nAt last, one morning I awoke to find the sunlight falling across my\r\nbed, and Jack Scott reading beside me. I had not strength enough to\r\nspeak aloud, neither could I think, much less remember, but I could\r\nsmile feebly, as Jack’s eye met mine, and when he jumped up and asked\r\neagerly if I wanted anything, I could whisper, “Yes—Boris.” Jack moved\r\nto the head of my bed, and leaned down to arrange my pillow: I did not\r\nsee his face, but he answered heartily, “You must wait, Alec; you are\r\ntoo weak to see even Boris.”\r\n\r\nI waited and I grew strong; in a few days I was able to see whom I\r\nwould, but meanwhile I had thought and remembered. From the moment\r\nwhen all the past grew clear again in my mind, I never doubted what I\r\nshould do when the time came, and I felt sure that Boris would have\r\nresolved upon the same course so far as he was concerned; as for what\r\npertained to me alone, I knew he would see that also as I did. I no\r\nlonger asked for any one. I never inquired why no message came from\r\nthem; why during the week I lay there, waiting and growing stronger, I\r\nnever heard their name spoken. Preoccupied with my own searchings for\r\nthe right way, and with my feeble but determined fight against despair,\r\nI simply acquiesced in Jack’s reticence, taking for granted that he was\r\nafraid to speak of them, lest I should turn unruly and insist on seeing\r\nthem. Meanwhile I said over and over to myself, how would it be when\r\nlife began again for us all? We would take up our relations exactly\r\nas they were before Geneviève fell ill. Boris and I would look into\r\neach other’s eyes, and there would be neither rancour nor cowardice\r\nnor mistrust in that glance. I would be with them again for a little\r\nwhile in the dear intimacy of their home, and then, without pretext or\r\nexplanation, I would disappear from their lives for ever. Boris would\r\nknow; Geneviève—the only comfort was that she would never know. It\r\nseemed, as I thought it over, that I had found the meaning of that\r\nsense of obligation which had persisted all through my delirium, and\r\nthe only possible answer to it. So, when I was quite ready, I beckoned\r\nJack to me one day, and said—\r\n\r\n“Jack, I want Boris at once; and take my dearest greeting to\r\nGeneviève....”\r\n\r\nWhen at last he made me understand that they were both dead, I fell\r\ninto a wild rage that tore all my little convalescent strength to\r\natoms. I raved and cursed myself into a relapse, from which I crawled\r\nforth some weeks afterward a boy of twenty-one who believed that his\r\nyouth was gone for ever. I seemed to be past the capability of further\r\nsuffering, and one day when Jack handed me a letter and the keys to\r\nBoris’ house, I took them without a tremor and asked him to tell me\r\nall. It was cruel of me to ask him, but there was no help for it, and\r\nhe leaned wearily on his thin hands, to reopen the wound which could\r\nnever entirely heal. He began very quietly—\r\n\r\n“Alec, unless you have a clue that I know nothing about, you will not\r\nbe able to explain any more than I what has happened. I suspect that\r\nyou would rather not hear these details, but you must learn them, else\r\nI would spare you the relation. God knows I wish I could be spared the\r\ntelling. I shall use few words.\r\n\r\n“That day when I left you in the doctor’s care and came back to Boris,\r\nI found him working on the ‘Fates.’ Geneviève, he said, was sleeping\r\nunder the influence of drugs. She had been quite out of her mind, he\r\nsaid. He kept on working, not talking any more, and I watched him.\r\nBefore long, I saw that the third figure of the group—the one looking\r\nstraight ahead, out over the world—bore his face; not as you ever saw\r\nit, but as it looked then and to the end. This is one thing for which I\r\nshould like to find an explanation, but I never shall.\r\n\r\n“Well, he worked and I watched him in silence, and we went on that way\r\nuntil nearly midnight. Then we heard the door open and shut sharply,\r\nand a swift rush in the next room. Boris sprang through the doorway\r\nand I followed; but we were too late. She lay at the bottom of the\r\npool, her hands across her breast. Then Boris shot himself through the\r\nheart.” Jack stopped speaking, drops of sweat stood under his eyes, and\r\nhis thin cheeks twitched. “I carried Boris to his room. Then I went\r\nback and let that hellish fluid out of the pool, and turning on all the\r\nwater, washed the marble clean of every drop. When at length I dared\r\ndescend the steps, I found her lying there as white as snow. At last,\r\nwhen I had decided what was best to do, I went into the laboratory,\r\nand first emptied the solution in the basin into the waste-pipe; then\r\nI poured the contents of every jar and bottle after it. There was\r\nwood in the fireplace, so I built a fire, and breaking the locks of\r\nBoris’ cabinet I burnt every paper, notebook and letter that I found\r\nthere. With a mallet from the studio I smashed to pieces all the empty\r\nbottles, then loading them into a coal-scuttle, I carried them to the\r\ncellar and threw them over the red-hot bed of the furnace. Six times\r\nI made the journey, and at last, not a vestige remained of anything\r\nwhich might again aid in seeking for the formula which Boris had found.\r\nThen at last I dared call the doctor. He is a good man, and together we\r\nstruggled to keep it from the public. Without him I never could have\r\nsucceeded. At last we got the servants paid and sent away into the\r\ncountry, where old Rosier keeps them quiet with stories of Boris’ and\r\nGeneviève’s travels in distant lands, from whence they will not return\r\nfor years. We buried Boris in the little cemetery of Sèvres. The doctor\r\nis a good creature, and knows when to pity a man who can bear no more.\r\nHe gave his certificate of heart disease and asked no questions of me.”\r\n\r\nThen, lifting his head from his hands, he said, “Open the letter, Alec;\r\nit is for us both.”\r\n\r\nI tore it open. It was Boris’ will dated a year before. He left\r\neverything to Geneviève, and in case of her dying childless, I was to\r\ntake control of the house in the Rue Sainte-Cécile, and Jack Scott the\r\nmanagement at Ept. On our deaths the property reverted to his mother’s\r\nfamily in Russia, with the exception of the sculptured marbles executed\r\nby himself. These he left to me.\r\n\r\nThe page blurred under our eyes, and Jack got up and walked to the\r\nwindow. Presently he returned and sat down again. I dreaded to hear\r\nwhat he was going to say, but he spoke with the same simplicity and\r\ngentleness.\r\n\r\n“Geneviève lies before the Madonna in the marble room. The Madonna\r\nbends tenderly above her, and Geneviève smiles back into that calm face\r\nthat never would have been except for her.”\r\n\r\nHis voice broke, but he grasped my hand, saying, “Courage, Alec.” Next\r\nmorning he left for Ept to fulfil his trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nThe same evening I took the keys and went into the house I had known\r\nso well. Everything was in order, but the silence was terrible. Though\r\nI went twice to the door of the marble room, I could not force myself\r\nto enter. It was beyond my strength. I went into the smoking-room and\r\nsat down before the spinet. A small lace handkerchief lay on the keys,\r\nand I turned away, choking. It was plain I could not stay, so I locked\r\nevery door, every window, and the three front and back gates, and\r\nwent away. Next morning Alcide packed my valise, and leaving him in\r\ncharge of my apartments I took the Orient express for Constantinople.\r\nDuring the two years that I wandered through the East, at first, in our\r\nletters, we never mentioned Geneviève and Boris, but gradually their\r\nnames crept in. I recollect particularly a passage in one of Jack’s\r\nletters replying to one of mine—\r\n\r\n“What you tell me of seeing Boris bending over you while you lay ill,\r\nand feeling his touch on your face, and hearing his voice, of course\r\ntroubles me. This that you describe must have happened a fortnight\r\nafter he died. I say to myself that you were dreaming, that it was part\r\nof your delirium, but the explanation does not satisfy me, nor would it\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second year a letter came from Jack to me in\r\nIndia so unlike anything that I had ever known of him that I decided\r\nto return at once to Paris. He wrote: “I am well, and sell all my\r\npictures as artists do who have no need of money. I have not a care of\r\nmy own, but I am more restless than if I had. I am unable to shake off\r\na strange anxiety about you. It is not apprehension, it is rather a\r\nbreathless expectancy—of what, God knows! I can only say it is wearing\r\nme out. Nights I dream always of you and Boris. I can never recall\r\nanything afterward, but I wake in the morning with my heart beating,\r\nand all day the excitement increases until I fall asleep at night\r\nto recall the same experience. I am quite exhausted by it, and have\r\ndetermined to break up this morbid condition. I must see you. Shall I\r\ngo to Bombay, or will you come to Paris?”\r\n\r\nI telegraphed him to expect me by the next steamer.\r\n\r\nWhen we met I thought he had changed very little; I, he insisted,\r\nlooked in splendid health. It was good to hear his voice again, and as\r\nwe sat and chatted about what life still held for us, we felt that it\r\nwas pleasant to be alive in the bright spring weather.\r\n\r\nWe stayed in Paris together a week, and then I went for a week to Ept\r\nwith him, but first of all we went to the cemetery at Sèvres, where\r\nBoris lay.\r\n\r\n“Shall we place the ‘Fates’ in the little grove above him?” Jack asked,\r\nand I answered—\r\n\r\n“I think only the ‘Madonna’ should watch over Boris’ grave.” But Jack\r\nwas none the better for my home-coming. The dreams of which he could\r\nnot retain even the least definite outline continued, and he said that\r\nat times the sense of breathless expectancy was suffocating.\r\n\r\n“You see I do you harm and not good,” I said. “Try a change without\r\nme.” So he started alone for a ramble among the Channel Islands, and I\r\nwent back to Paris. I had not yet entered Boris’ house, now mine, since\r\nmy return, but I knew it must be done. It had been kept in order by\r\nJack; there were servants there, so I gave up my own apartment and went\r\nthere to live. Instead of the agitation I had feared, I found myself\r\nable to paint there tranquilly. I visited all the rooms—all but one.\r\nI could not bring myself to enter the marble room where Geneviève lay,\r\nand yet I felt the longing growing daily to look upon her face, to\r\nkneel beside her.\r\n\r\nOne April afternoon, I lay dreaming in the smoking-room, just as\r\nI had lain two years before, and mechanically I looked among the\r\ntawny Eastern rugs for the wolf-skin. At last I distinguished the\r\npointed ears and flat cruel head, and I thought of my dream where\r\nI saw Geneviève lying beside it. The helmets still hung against\r\nthe threadbare tapestry, among them the old Spanish morion which I\r\nremembered Geneviève had once put on when we were amusing ourselves\r\nwith the ancient bits of mail. I turned my eyes to the spinet; every\r\nyellow key seemed eloquent of her caressing hand, and I rose, drawn\r\nby the strength of my life’s passion to the sealed door of the marble\r\nroom. The heavy doors swung inward under my trembling hands. Sunlight\r\npoured through the window, tipping with gold the wings of Cupid, and\r\nlingered like a nimbus over the brows of the Madonna. Her tender face\r\nbent in compassion over a marble form so exquisitely pure that I knelt\r\nand signed myself. Geneviève lay in the shadow under the Madonna, and\r\nyet, through her white arms, I saw the pale azure vein, and beneath her\r\nsoftly clasped hands the folds of her dress were tinged with rose, as\r\nif from some faint warm light within her breast.\r\n\r\nBending, with a breaking heart, I touched the marble drapery with my\r\nlips, then crept back into the silent house.\r\n\r\nA maid came and brought me a letter, and I sat down in the little\r\nconservatory to read it; but as I was about to break the seal, seeing\r\nthe girl lingering, I asked her what she wanted.\r\n\r\nShe stammered something about a white rabbit that had been caught in\r\nthe house, and asked what should be done with it. I told her to let it\r\nloose in the walled garden behind the house, and opened my letter. It\r\nwas from Jack, but so incoherent that I thought he must have lost his\r\nreason. It was nothing but a series of prayers to me not to leave the\r\nhouse until he could get back; he could not tell me why, there were the\r\ndreams, he said—he could explain nothing, but he was sure that I must\r\nnot leave the house in the Rue Sainte-Cécile.\r\n\r\nAs I finished reading I raised my eyes and saw the same maid-servant\r\nstanding in the doorway holding a glass dish in which two gold-fish\r\nwere swimming: “Put them back into the tank and tell me what you mean\r\nby interrupting me,” I said.\r\n\r\nWith a half-suppressed whimper she emptied water and fish into an\r\naquarium at the end of the conservatory, and turning to me asked my\r\npermission to leave my service. She said people were playing tricks on\r\nher, evidently with a design of getting her into trouble; the marble\r\nrabbit had been stolen and a live one had been brought into the house;\r\nthe two beautiful marble fish were gone, and she had just found those\r\ncommon live things flopping on the dining-room floor. I reassured her\r\nand sent her away, saying I would look about myself. I went into the\r\nstudio; there was nothing there but my canvases and some casts, except\r\nthe marble of the Easter lily. I saw it on a table across the room.\r\nThen I strode angrily over to it. But the flower I lifted from the\r\ntable was fresh and fragile and filled the air with perfume.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly I comprehended, and sprang through the hallway to the\r\nmarble room. The doors flew open, the sunlight streamed into my face,\r\nand through it, in a heavenly glory, the Madonna smiled, as Geneviève\r\nlifted her flushed face from her marble couch and opened her sleepy\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IN THE COURT OF THE DRAGON\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Oh, thou who burn’st in heart for those who burn\r\n     In Hell, whose fires thyself shall feed in turn;\r\n     How long be crying—‘Mercy on them.’ God!\r\n     Why, who art thou to teach and He to learn?”\r\n\r\nIn the Church of St. Barnabé vespers were over; the clergy left the\r\naltar; the little choir-boys flocked across the chancel and settled\r\nin the stalls. A Suisse in rich uniform marched down the south aisle,\r\nsounding his staff at every fourth step on the stone pavement; behind\r\nhim came that eloquent preacher and good man, Monseigneur C——.\r\n\r\nMy chair was near the chancel rail, I now turned toward the west end of\r\nthe church. The other people between the altar and the pulpit turned\r\ntoo. There was a little scraping and rustling while the congregation\r\nseated itself again; the preacher mounted the pulpit stairs, and the\r\norgan voluntary ceased.\r\n\r\nI had always found the organ-playing at St. Barnabé highly interesting.\r\nLearned and scientific it was, too much so for my small knowledge,\r\nbut expressing a vivid if cold intelligence. Moreover, it possessed\r\nthe French quality of taste: taste reigned supreme, self-controlled,\r\ndignified and reticent.\r\n\r\nTo-day, however, from the first chord I had felt a change for the\r\nworse, a sinister change. During vespers it had been chiefly the\r\nchancel organ which supported the beautiful choir, but now and again,\r\nquite wantonly as it seemed, from the west gallery where the great\r\norgan stands, a heavy hand had struck across the church at the serene\r\npeace of those clear voices. It was something more than harsh and\r\ndissonant, and it betrayed no lack of skill. As it recurred again and\r\nagain, it set me thinking of what my architect’s books say about the\r\ncustom in early times to consecrate the choir as soon as it was built,\r\nand that the nave, being finished sometimes half a century later, often\r\ndid not get any blessing at all: I wondered idly if that had been the\r\ncase at St. Barnabé, and whether something not usually supposed to be\r\nat home in a Christian church might have entered undetected and taken\r\npossession of the west gallery. I had read of such things happening,\r\ntoo, but not in works on architecture.\r\n\r\nThen I remembered that St. Barnabé was not much more than a hundred\r\nyears old, and smiled at the incongruous association of mediaeval\r\nsuperstitions with that cheerful little piece of eighteenth-century\r\nrococo.\r\n\r\nBut now vespers were over, and there should have followed a few quiet\r\nchords, fit to accompany meditation, while we waited for the sermon.\r\nInstead of that, the discord at the lower end of the church broke out\r\nwith the departure of the clergy, as if now nothing could control it.\r\n\r\nI belong to those children of an older and simpler generation who do\r\nnot love to seek for psychological subtleties in art; and I have ever\r\nrefused to find in music anything more than melody and harmony, but I\r\nfelt that in the labyrinth of sounds now issuing from that instrument\r\nthere was something being hunted. Up and down the pedals chased him,\r\nwhile the manuals blared approval. Poor devil! whoever he was, there\r\nseemed small hope of escape!\r\n\r\nMy nervous annoyance changed to anger. Who was doing this? How dare\r\nhe play like that in the midst of divine service? I glanced at the\r\npeople near me: not one appeared to be in the least disturbed. The\r\nplacid brows of the kneeling nuns, still turned towards the altar, lost\r\nnone of their devout abstraction under the pale shadow of their white\r\nhead-dress. The fashionable lady beside me was looking expectantly at\r\nMonseigneur C——. For all her face betrayed, the organ might have been\r\nsinging an Ave Maria.\r\n\r\nBut now, at last, the preacher had made the sign of the cross, and\r\ncommanded silence. I turned to him gladly. Thus far I had not found the\r\nrest I had counted on when I entered St. Barnabé that afternoon.\r\n\r\nI was worn out by three nights of physical suffering and mental\r\ntrouble: the last had been the worst, and it was an exhausted body,\r\nand a mind benumbed and yet acutely sensitive, which I had brought to\r\nmy favourite church for healing. For I had been reading _The King in\r\nYellow_.\r\n\r\n“The sun ariseth; they gather themselves together and lay them down\r\nin their dens.” Monseigneur C—— delivered his text in a calm voice,\r\nglancing quietly over the congregation. My eyes turned, I knew not\r\nwhy, toward the lower end of the church. The organist was coming from\r\nbehind his pipes, and passing along the gallery on his way out, I saw\r\nhim disappear by a small door that leads to some stairs which descend\r\ndirectly to the street. He was a slender man, and his face was as white\r\nas his coat was black. “Good riddance!” I thought, “with your wicked\r\nmusic! I hope your assistant will play the closing voluntary.”\r\n\r\nWith a feeling of relief—with a deep, calm feeling of relief, I turned\r\nback to the mild face in the pulpit and settled myself to listen. Here,\r\nat last, was the ease of mind I longed for.\r\n\r\n“My children,” said the preacher, “one truth the human soul finds\r\nhardest of all to learn: that it has nothing to fear. It can never be\r\nmade to see that nothing can really harm it.”\r\n\r\n“Curious doctrine!” I thought, “for a Catholic priest. Let us see how\r\nhe will reconcile that with the Fathers.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing can really harm the soul,” he went on, in, his coolest,\r\nclearest tones, “because——”\r\n\r\nBut I never heard the rest; my eye left his face, I knew not for what\r\nreason, and sought the lower end of the church. The same man was coming\r\nout from behind the organ, and was passing along the gallery _the same\r\nway_. But there had not been time for him to return, and if he had\r\nreturned, I must have seen him. I felt a faint chill, and my heart\r\nsank; and yet, his going and coming were no affair of mine. I looked\r\nat him: I could not look away from his black figure and his white\r\nface. When he was exactly opposite to me, he turned and sent across\r\nthe church straight into my eyes, a look of hate, intense and deadly:\r\nI have never seen any other like it; would to God I might never see it\r\nagain! Then he disappeared by the same door through which I had watched\r\nhim depart less than sixty seconds before.\r\n\r\nI sat and tried to collect my thoughts. My first sensation was like\r\nthat of a very young child badly hurt, when it catches its breath\r\nbefore crying out.\r\n\r\nTo suddenly find myself the object of such hatred was exquisitely\r\npainful: and this man was an utter stranger. Why should he hate me\r\nso?—me, whom he had never seen before? For the moment all other\r\nsensation was merged in this one pang: even fear was subordinate to\r\ngrief, and for that moment I never doubted; but in the next I began to\r\nreason, and a sense of the incongruous came to my aid.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, St. Barnabé is a modern church. It is small and well\r\nlighted; one sees all over it almost at a glance. The organ gallery\r\ngets a strong white light from a row of long windows in the clerestory,\r\nwhich have not even coloured glass.\r\n\r\nThe pulpit being in the middle of the church, it followed that, when I\r\nwas turned toward it, whatever moved at the west end could not fail to\r\nattract my eye. When the organist passed it was no wonder that I saw\r\nhim: I had simply miscalculated the interval between his first and his\r\nsecond passing. He had come in that last time by the other side-door.\r\nAs for the look which had so upset me, there had been no such thing,\r\nand I was a nervous fool.\r\n\r\nI looked about. This was a likely place to harbour supernatural\r\nhorrors! That clear-cut, reasonable face of Monseigneur C——, his\r\ncollected manner and easy, graceful gestures, were they not just a\r\nlittle discouraging to the notion of a gruesome mystery? I glanced\r\nabove his head, and almost laughed. That flyaway lady supporting\r\none corner of the pulpit canopy, which looked like a fringed damask\r\ntable-cloth in a high wind, at the first attempt of a basilisk to pose\r\nup there in the organ loft, she would point her gold trumpet at him,\r\nand puff him out of existence! I laughed to myself over this conceit,\r\nwhich, at the time, I thought very amusing, and sat and chaffed myself\r\nand everything else, from the old harpy outside the railing, who had\r\nmade me pay ten centimes for my chair, before she would let me in\r\n(she was more like a basilisk, I told myself, than was my organist\r\nwith the anaemic complexion): from that grim old dame, to, yes, alas!\r\nMonseigneur C—— himself. For all devoutness had fled. I had never yet\r\ndone such a thing in my life, but now I felt a desire to mock.\r\n\r\nAs for the sermon, I could not hear a word of it for the jingle in my\r\nears of\r\n\r\n    “The skirts of St. Paul has reached.\r\n     Having preached us those six Lent lectures,\r\n     More unctuous than ever he preached,”\r\n\r\nkeeping time to the most fantastic and irreverent thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt was no use to sit there any longer: I must get out of doors and\r\nshake myself free from this hateful mood. I knew the rudeness I was\r\ncommitting, but still I rose and left the church.\r\n\r\nA spring sun was shining on the Rue St. Honoré, as I ran down the\r\nchurch steps. On one corner stood a barrow full of yellow jonquils,\r\npale violets from the Riviera, dark Russian violets, and white Roman\r\nhyacinths in a golden cloud of mimosa. The street was full of Sunday\r\npleasure-seekers. I swung my cane and laughed with the rest. Some one\r\novertook and passed me. He never turned, but there was the same deadly\r\nmalignity in his white profile that there had been in his eyes. I\r\nwatched him as long as I could see him. His lithe back expressed the\r\nsame menace; every step that carried him away from me seemed to bear\r\nhim on some errand connected with my destruction.\r\n\r\nI was creeping along, my feet almost refusing to move. There began to\r\ndawn in me a sense of responsibility for something long forgotten. It\r\nbegan to seem as if I deserved that which he threatened: it reached a\r\nlong way back—a long, long way back. It had lain dormant all these\r\nyears: it was there, though, and presently it would rise and confront\r\nme. But I would try to escape; and I stumbled as best I could into the\r\nRue de Rivoli, across the Place de la Concorde and on to the Quai. I\r\nlooked with sick eyes upon the sun, shining through the white foam of\r\nthe fountain, pouring over the backs of the dusky bronze river-gods, on\r\nthe far-away Arc, a structure of amethyst mist, on the countless vistas\r\nof grey stems and bare branches faintly green. Then I saw him again\r\ncoming down one of the chestnut alleys of the Cours la Reine.\r\n\r\nI left the river-side, plunged blindly across to the Champs Elysées\r\nand turned toward the Arc. The setting sun was sending its rays along\r\nthe green sward of the Rond-point: in the full glow he sat on a bench,\r\nchildren and young mothers all about him. He was nothing but a Sunday\r\nlounger, like the others, like myself. I said the words almost aloud,\r\nand all the while I gazed on the malignant hatred of his face. But he\r\nwas not looking at me. I crept past and dragged my leaden feet up the\r\nAvenue. I knew that every time I met him brought him nearer to the\r\naccomplishment of his purpose and my fate. And still I tried to save\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThe last rays of sunset were pouring through the great Arc. I passed\r\nunder it, and met him face to face. I had left him far down the Champs\r\nElysées, and yet he came in with a stream of people who were returning\r\nfrom the Bois de Boulogne. He came so close that he brushed me. His\r\nslender frame felt like iron inside its loose black covering. He showed\r\nno signs of haste, nor of fatigue, nor of any human feeling. His whole\r\nbeing expressed one thing: the will, and the power to work me evil.\r\n\r\nIn anguish I watched him where he went down the broad crowded Avenue,\r\nthat was all flashing with wheels and the trappings of horses and the\r\nhelmets of the Garde Republicaine.\r\n\r\nHe was soon lost to sight; then I turned and fled. Into the Bois, and\r\nfar out beyond it—I know not where I went, but after a long while as\r\nit seemed to me, night had fallen, and I found myself sitting at a\r\ntable before a small café. I had wandered back into the Bois. It was\r\nhours now since I had seen him. Physical fatigue and mental suffering\r\nhad left me no power to think or feel. I was tired, so tired! I longed\r\nto hide away in my own den. I resolved to go home. But that was a long\r\nway off.\r\n\r\nI live in the Court of the Dragon, a narrow passage that leads from the\r\nRue de Rennes to the Rue du Dragon.\r\n\r\nIt is an “impasse”; traversable only for foot passengers. Over the\r\nentrance on the Rue de Rennes is a balcony, supported by an iron\r\ndragon. Within the court tall old houses rise on either side, and close\r\nthe ends that give on the two streets. Huge gates, swung back during\r\nthe day into the walls of the deep archways, close this court, after\r\nmidnight, and one must enter then by ringing at certain small doors on\r\nthe side. The sunken pavement collects unsavoury pools. Steep stairways\r\npitch down to doors that open on the court. The ground floors are\r\noccupied by shops of second-hand dealers, and by iron workers. All day\r\nlong the place rings with the clink of hammers and the clang of metal\r\nbars.\r\n\r\nUnsavoury as it is below, there is cheerfulness, and comfort, and hard,\r\nhonest work above.\r\n\r\nFive flights up are the ateliers of architects and painters, and the\r\nhiding-places of middle-aged students like myself who want to live\r\nalone. When I first came here to live I was young, and not alone.\r\n\r\nI had to walk a while before any conveyance appeared, but at last, when\r\nI had almost reached the Arc de Triomphe again, an empty cab came along\r\nand I took it.\r\n\r\nFrom the Arc to the Rue de Rennes is a drive of more than half an hour,\r\nespecially when one is conveyed by a tired cab horse that has been at\r\nthe mercy of Sunday fête-makers.\r\n\r\nThere had been time before I passed under the Dragon’s wings to meet my\r\nenemy over and over again, but I never saw him once, and now refuge was\r\nclose at hand.\r\n\r\nBefore the wide gateway a small mob of children were playing. Our\r\nconcierge and his wife walked among them, with their black poodle,\r\nkeeping order; some couples were waltzing on the sidewalk. I returned\r\ntheir greetings and hurried in.\r\n\r\nAll the inhabitants of the court had trooped out into the street. The\r\nplace was quite deserted, lighted by a few lanterns hung high up, in\r\nwhich the gas burned dimly.\r\n\r\nMy apartment was at the top of a house, halfway down the court, reached\r\nby a staircase that descended almost into the street, with only a bit\r\nof passage-way intervening, I set my foot on the threshold of the open\r\ndoor, the friendly old ruinous stairs rose before me, leading up to\r\nrest and shelter. Looking back over my right shoulder, I saw _him,_ ten\r\npaces off. He must have entered the court with me.\r\n\r\nHe was coming straight on, neither slowly, nor swiftly, but straight on\r\nto me. And now he was looking at me. For the first time since our eyes\r\nencountered across the church they met now again, and I knew that the\r\ntime had come.\r\n\r\nRetreating backward, down the court, I faced him. I meant to escape by\r\nthe entrance on the Rue du Dragon. His eyes told me that I never should\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nIt seemed ages while we were going, I retreating, he advancing, down\r\nthe court in perfect silence; but at last I felt the shadow of the\r\narchway, and the next step brought me within it. I had meant to turn\r\nhere and spring through into the street. But the shadow was not that\r\nof an archway; it was that of a vault. The great doors on the Rue du\r\nDragon were closed. I felt this by the blackness which surrounded me,\r\nand at the same instant I read it in his face. How his face gleamed in\r\nthe darkness, drawing swiftly nearer! The deep vaults, the huge closed\r\ndoors, their cold iron clamps were all on his side. The thing which\r\nhe had threatened had arrived: it gathered and bore down on me from\r\nthe fathomless shadows; the point from which it would strike was his\r\ninfernal eyes. Hopeless, I set my back against the barred doors and\r\ndefied him.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a scraping of chairs on the stone floor, and a rustling as\r\nthe congregation rose. I could hear the Suisse’s staff in the south\r\naisle, preceding Monseigneur C—— to the sacristy.\r\n\r\nThe kneeling nuns, roused from their devout abstraction, made their\r\nreverence and went away. The fashionable lady, my neighbour, rose also,\r\nwith graceful reserve. As she departed her glance just flitted over my\r\nface in disapproval.\r\n\r\nHalf dead, or so it seemed to me, yet intensely alive to every trifle,\r\nI sat among the leisurely moving crowd, then rose too and went toward\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nI had slept through the sermon. Had I slept through the sermon? I\r\nlooked up and saw him passing along the gallery to his place. Only\r\nhis side I saw; the thin bent arm in its black covering looked like\r\none of those devilish, nameless instruments which lie in the disused\r\ntorture-chambers of mediaeval castles.\r\n\r\nBut I had escaped him, though his eyes had said I should not. _Had_ I\r\nescaped him? That which gave him the power over me came back out of\r\noblivion, where I had hoped to keep it. For I knew him now. Death and\r\nthe awful abode of lost souls, whither my weakness long ago had sent\r\nhim—they had changed him for every other eye, but not for mine. I\r\nhad recognized him almost from the first; I had never doubted what he\r\nwas come to do; and now I knew while my body sat safe in the cheerful\r\nlittle church, he had been hunting my soul in the Court of the Dragon.\r\n\r\nI crept to the door: the organ broke out overhead with a blare. A\r\ndazzling light filled the church, blotting the altar from my eyes. The\r\npeople faded away, the arches, the vaulted roof vanished. I raised my\r\nseared eyes to the fathomless glare, and I saw the black stars hanging\r\nin the heavens: and the wet winds from the lake of Hali chilled my face.\r\n\r\nAnd now, far away, over leagues of tossing cloud-waves, I saw the moon\r\ndripping with spray; and beyond, the towers of Carcosa rose behind the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nDeath and the awful abode of lost souls, whither my weakness long ago\r\nhad sent him, had changed him for every other eye but mine. And now I\r\nheard _his voice_, rising, swelling, thundering through the flaring\r\nlight, and as I fell, the radiance increasing, increasing, poured over\r\nme in waves of flame. Then I sank into the depths, and I heard the King\r\nin Yellow whispering to my soul: “It is a fearful thing to fall into\r\nthe hands of the living God!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE YELLOW SIGN\r\n\r\n    “Let the red dawn surmise\r\n       What we shall do,\r\n     When this blue starlight dies\r\n       And all is through.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nThere are so many things which are impossible to explain! Why should\r\ncertain chords in music make me think of the brown and golden tints of\r\nautumn foliage? Why should the Mass of Sainte Cécile bend my thoughts\r\nwandering among caverns whose walls blaze with ragged masses of virgin\r\nsilver? What was it in the roar and turmoil of Broadway at six o’clock\r\nthat flashed before my eyes the picture of a still Breton forest\r\nwhere sunlight filtered through spring foliage and Sylvia bent, half\r\ncuriously, half tenderly, over a small green lizard, murmuring: “To\r\nthink that this also is a little ward of God!”\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the watchman his back was toward me. I looked at him\r\nindifferently until he went into the church. I paid no more attention\r\nto him than I had to any other man who lounged through Washington\r\nSquare that morning, and when I shut my window and turned back into\r\nmy studio I had forgotten him. Late in the afternoon, the day being\r\nwarm, I raised the window again and leaned out to get a sniff of air.\r\nA man was standing in the courtyard of the church, and I noticed him\r\nagain with as little interest as I had that morning. I looked across\r\nthe square to where the fountain was playing and then, with my mind\r\nfilled with vague impressions of trees, asphalt drives, and the moving\r\ngroups of nursemaids and holiday-makers, I started to walk back to\r\nmy easel. As I turned, my listless glance included the man below in\r\nthe churchyard. His face was toward me now, and with a perfectly\r\ninvoluntary movement I bent to see it. At the same moment he raised\r\nhis head and looked at me. Instantly I thought of a coffin-worm.\r\nWhatever it was about the man that repelled me I did not know, but the\r\nimpression of a plump white grave-worm was so intense and nauseating\r\nthat I must have shown it in my expression, for he turned his puffy\r\nface away with a movement which made me think of a disturbed grub in a\r\nchestnut.\r\n\r\nI went back to my easel and motioned the model to resume her pose.\r\nAfter working a while I was satisfied that I was spoiling what I had\r\ndone as rapidly as possible, and I took up a palette knife and scraped\r\nthe colour out again. The flesh tones were sallow and unhealthy, and I\r\ndid not understand how I could have painted such sickly colour into a\r\nstudy which before that had glowed with healthy tones.\r\n\r\nI looked at Tessie. She had not changed, and the clear flush of health\r\ndyed her neck and cheeks as I frowned.\r\n\r\n“Is it something I’ve done?” she said.\r\n\r\n“No,—I’ve made a mess of this arm, and for the life of me I can’t see\r\nhow I came to paint such mud as that into the canvas,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Don’t I pose well?” she insisted.\r\n\r\n“Of course, perfectly.”\r\n\r\n“Then it’s not my fault?”\r\n\r\n“No. It’s my own.”\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry,” she said.\r\n\r\nI told her she could rest while I applied rag and turpentine to the\r\nplague spot on my canvas, and she went off to smoke a cigarette and\r\nlook over the illustrations in the _Courrier Français_.\r\n\r\nI did not know whether it was something in the turpentine or a defect\r\nin the canvas, but the more I scrubbed the more that gangrene seemed\r\nto spread. I worked like a beaver to get it out, and yet the disease\r\nappeared to creep from limb to limb of the study before me. Alarmed, I\r\nstrove to arrest it, but now the colour on the breast changed and the\r\nwhole figure seemed to absorb the infection as a sponge soaks up water.\r\nVigorously I plied palette-knife, turpentine, and scraper, thinking\r\nall the time what a _séance_ I should hold with Duval who had sold me\r\nthe canvas; but soon I noticed that it was not the canvas which was\r\ndefective nor yet the colours of Edward. “It must be the turpentine,” I\r\nthought angrily, “or else my eyes have become so blurred and confused\r\nby the afternoon light that I can’t see straight.” I called Tessie, the\r\nmodel. She came and leaned over my chair blowing rings of smoke into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n“What _have_ you been doing to it?” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” I growled, “it must be this turpentine!”\r\n\r\n“What a horrible colour it is now,” she continued. “Do you think my\r\nflesh resembles green cheese?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t,” I said angrily; “did you ever know me to paint like that\r\nbefore?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed!”\r\n\r\n“Well, then!”\r\n\r\n“It must be the turpentine, or something,” she admitted.\r\n\r\nShe slipped on a Japanese robe and walked to the window. I scraped and\r\nrubbed until I was tired, and finally picked up my brushes and hurled\r\nthem through the canvas with a forcible expression, the tone alone of\r\nwhich reached Tessie’s ears.\r\n\r\nNevertheless she promptly began: “That’s it! Swear and act silly and\r\nruin your brushes! You have been three weeks on that study, and now\r\nlook! What’s the good of ripping the canvas? What creatures artists\r\nare!”\r\n\r\nI felt about as much ashamed as I usually did after such an outbreak,\r\nand I turned the ruined canvas to the wall. Tessie helped me clean my\r\nbrushes, and then danced away to dress. From the screen she regaled me\r\nwith bits of advice concerning whole or partial loss of temper, until,\r\nthinking, perhaps, I had been tormented sufficiently, she came out to\r\nimplore me to button her waist where she could not reach it on the\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“Everything went wrong from the time you came back from the window and\r\ntalked about that horrid-looking man you saw in the churchyard,” she\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he probably bewitched the picture,” I said, yawning. I looked at\r\nmy watch.\r\n\r\n“It’s after six, I know,” said Tessie, adjusting her hat before the\r\nmirror.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied, “I didn’t mean to keep you so long.” I leaned out\r\nof the window but recoiled with disgust, for the young man with the\r\npasty face stood below in the churchyard. Tessie saw my gesture of\r\ndisapproval and leaned from the window.\r\n\r\n“Is that the man you don’t like?” she whispered.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“I can’t see his face, but he does look fat and soft. Someway or\r\nother,” she continued, turning to look at me, “he reminds me of a\r\ndream,—an awful dream I once had. Or,” she mused, looking down at her\r\nshapely shoes, “was it a dream after all?”\r\n\r\n“How should I know?” I smiled.\r\n\r\nTessie smiled in reply.\r\n\r\n“You were in it,” she said, “so perhaps you might know something about\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Tessie! Tessie!” I protested, “don’t you dare flatter by saying that\r\nyou dream about me!”\r\n\r\n“But I did,” she insisted; “shall I tell you about it?”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead,” I replied, lighting a cigarette.\r\n\r\nTessie leaned back on the open window-sill and began very seriously.\r\n\r\n“One night last winter I was lying in bed thinking about nothing at all\r\nin particular. I had been posing for you and I was tired out, yet it\r\nseemed impossible for me to sleep. I heard the bells in the city ring\r\nten, eleven, and midnight. I must have fallen asleep about midnight\r\nbecause I don’t remember hearing the bells after that. It seemed to\r\nme that I had scarcely closed my eyes when I dreamed that something\r\nimpelled me to go to the window. I rose, and raising the sash leaned\r\nout. Twenty-fifth Street was deserted as far as I could see. I began to\r\nbe afraid; everything outside seemed so—so black and uncomfortable.\r\nThen the sound of wheels in the distance came to my ears, and it seemed\r\nto me as though that was what I must wait for. Very slowly the wheels\r\napproached, and, finally, I could make out a vehicle moving along the\r\nstreet. It came nearer and nearer, and when it passed beneath my window\r\nI saw it was a hearse. Then, as I trembled with fear, the driver turned\r\nand looked straight at me. When I awoke I was standing by the open\r\nwindow shivering with cold, but the black-plumed hearse and the driver\r\nwere gone. I dreamed this dream again in March last, and again awoke\r\nbeside the open window. Last night the dream came again. You remember\r\nhow it was raining; when I awoke, standing at the open window, my\r\nnight-dress was soaked.”\r\n\r\n“But where did I come into the dream?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“You—you were in the coffin; but you were not dead.”\r\n\r\n“In the coffin?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“How did you know? Could you see me?”\r\n\r\n“No; I only knew you were there.”\r\n\r\n“Had you been eating Welsh rarebits, or lobster salad?” I began,\r\nlaughing, but the girl interrupted me with a frightened cry.\r\n\r\n“Hello! What’s up?” I said, as she shrank into the embrasure by the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n“The—the man below in the churchyard;—he drove the hearse.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” I said, but Tessie’s eyes were wide with terror. I went to\r\nthe window and looked out. The man was gone. “Come, Tessie,” I urged,\r\n“don’t be foolish. You have posed too long; you are nervous.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I could forget that face?” she murmured. “Three times I\r\nsaw the hearse pass below my window, and every time the driver turned\r\nand looked up at me. Oh, his face was so white and—and soft? It looked\r\ndead—it looked as if it had been dead a long time.”\r\n\r\nI induced the girl to sit down and swallow a glass of Marsala. Then I\r\nsat down beside her, and tried to give her some advice.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Tessie,” I said, “you go to the country for a week or two,\r\nand you’ll have no more dreams about hearses. You pose all day, and\r\nwhen night comes your nerves are upset. You can’t keep this up. Then\r\nagain, instead of going to bed when your day’s work is done, you run\r\noff to picnics at Sulzer’s Park, or go to the Eldorado or Coney Island,\r\nand when you come down here next morning you are fagged out. There was\r\nno real hearse. There was a soft-shell crab dream.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n“What about the man in the churchyard?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s only an ordinary unhealthy, everyday creature.”\r\n\r\n“As true as my name is Tessie Reardon, I swear to you, Mr. Scott, that\r\nthe face of the man below in the churchyard is the face of the man who\r\ndrove the hearse!”\r\n\r\n“What of it?” I said. “It’s an honest trade.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think I _did_ see the hearse?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” I said diplomatically, “if you really did, it might not be\r\nunlikely that the man below drove it. There is nothing in that.”\r\n\r\nTessie rose, unrolled her scented handkerchief, and taking a bit of gum\r\nfrom a knot in the hem, placed it in her mouth. Then drawing on her\r\ngloves she offered me her hand, with a frank, “Good-night, Mr. Scott,”\r\nand walked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Thomas, the bell-boy, brought me the _Herald_ and a\r\nbit of news. The church next door had been sold. I thanked Heaven for\r\nit, not that being a Catholic I had any repugnance for the congregation\r\nnext door, but because my nerves were shattered by a blatant exhorter,\r\nwhose every word echoed through the aisle of the church as if it had\r\nbeen my own rooms, and who insisted on his r’s with a nasal persistence\r\nwhich revolted my every instinct. Then, too, there was a fiend in human\r\nshape, an organist, who reeled off some of the grand old hymns with an\r\ninterpretation of his own, and I longed for the blood of a creature\r\nwho could play the doxology with an amendment of minor chords which\r\none hears only in a quartet of very young undergraduates. I believe\r\nthe minister was a good man, but when he bellowed: “And the Lorrrrd\r\nsaid unto Moses, the Lorrrd is a man of war; the Lorrrd is his name. My\r\nwrath shall wax hot and I will kill you with the sworrrrd!” I wondered\r\nhow many centuries of purgatory it would take to atone for such a sin.\r\n\r\n“Who bought the property?” I asked Thomas.\r\n\r\n“Nobody that I knows, sir. They do say the gent wot owns this ’ere\r\n’Amilton flats was lookin’ at it. ’E might be a bildin’ more studios.”\r\n\r\nI walked to the window. The young man with the unhealthy face stood by\r\nthe churchyard gate, and at the mere sight of him the same overwhelming\r\nrepugnance took possession of me.\r\n\r\n“By the way, Thomas,” I said, “who is that fellow down there?”\r\n\r\nThomas sniffed. “That there worm, sir? ’Es night-watchman of the\r\nchurch, sir. ’E maikes me tired a-sittin’ out all night on them steps\r\nand lookin’ at you insultin’ like. I’d a punched ’is ’ed, sir—beg\r\npardon, sir—”\r\n\r\n“Go on, Thomas.”\r\n\r\n“One night a comin’ ’ome with ’Arry, the other English boy, I sees ’im\r\na sittin’ there on them steps. We ’ad Molly and Jen with us, sir, the\r\ntwo girls on the tray service, an’ ’e looks so insultin’ at us that\r\nI up and sez: ‘Wat you looking hat, you fat slug?’—beg pardon, sir,\r\nbut that’s ’ow I sez, sir. Then ’e don’t say nothin’ and I sez: ‘Come\r\nout and I’ll punch that puddin’ ’ed.’ Then I hopens the gate an’ goes\r\nin, but ’e don’t say nothin’, only looks insultin’ like. Then I ’its\r\n’im one, but, ugh! ’is ’ed was that cold and mushy it ud sicken you to\r\ntouch ’im.”\r\n\r\n“What did he do then?” I asked curiously.\r\n\r\n“’Im? Nawthin’.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Thomas?”\r\n\r\nThe young fellow flushed with embarrassment and smiled uneasily.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Scott, sir, I ain’t no coward, an’ I can’t make it out at all why\r\nI run. I was in the 5th Lawncers, sir, bugler at Tel-el-Kebir, an’ was\r\nshot by the wells.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean to say you ran away?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; I run.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I want to know, sir. I grabbed Molly an’ run, an’ the\r\nrest was as frightened as I.”\r\n\r\n“But what were they frightened at?”\r\n\r\nThomas refused to answer for a while, but now my curiosity was aroused\r\nabout the repulsive young man below and I pressed him. Three years’\r\nsojourn in America had not only modified Thomas’ cockney dialect but\r\nhad given him the American’s fear of ridicule.\r\n\r\n“You won’t believe me, Mr. Scott, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will.”\r\n\r\n“You will lawf at me, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. “Well, sir, it’s Gawd’s truth that when I ’it ’im ’e\r\ngrabbed me wrists, sir, and when I twisted ’is soft, mushy fist one of\r\n’is fingers come off in me ’and.”\r\n\r\nThe utter loathing and horror of Thomas’ face must have been reflected\r\nin my own, for he added:\r\n\r\n“It’s orful, an’ now when I see ’im I just go away. ’E maikes me hill.”\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas had gone I went to the window. The man stood beside the\r\nchurch-railing with both hands on the gate, but I hastily retreated\r\nto my easel again, sickened and horrified, for I saw that the middle\r\nfinger of his right hand was missing.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock Tessie appeared and vanished behind the screen with a\r\nmerry “Good morning, Mr. Scott.” When she had reappeared and taken her\r\npose upon the model-stand I started a new canvas, much to her delight.\r\nShe remained silent as long as I was on the drawing, but as soon as the\r\nscrape of the charcoal ceased and I took up my fixative she began to\r\nchatter.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I had such a lovely time last night. We went to Tony Pastor’s.”\r\n\r\n“Who are ‘we’?” I demanded.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Maggie, you know, Mr. Whyte’s model, and Pinkie McCormick—we call\r\nher Pinkie because she’s got that beautiful red hair you artists like\r\nso much—and Lizzie Burke.”\r\n\r\nI sent a shower of spray from the fixative over the canvas, and said:\r\n“Well, go on.”\r\n\r\n“We saw Kelly and Baby Barnes the skirt-dancer and—and all the rest. I\r\nmade a mash.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have gone back on me, Tessie?”\r\n\r\nShe laughed and shook her head.\r\n\r\n“He’s Lizzie Burke’s brother, Ed. He’s a perfect gen’l’man.”\r\n\r\nI felt constrained to give her some parental advice concerning mashing,\r\nwhich she took with a bright smile.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I can take care of a strange mash,” she said, examining her\r\nchewing gum, “but Ed is different. Lizzie is my best friend.”\r\n\r\nThen she related how Ed had come back from the stocking mill in\r\nLowell, Massachusetts, to find her and Lizzie grown up, and what\r\nan accomplished young man he was, and how he thought nothing of\r\nsquandering half-a-dollar for ice-cream and oysters to celebrate his\r\nentry as clerk into the woollen department of Macy’s. Before she\r\nfinished I began to paint, and she resumed the pose, smiling and\r\nchattering like a sparrow. By noon I had the study fairly well rubbed\r\nin and Tessie came to look at it.\r\n\r\n“That’s better,” she said.\r\n\r\nI thought so too, and ate my lunch with a satisfied feeling that all\r\nwas going well. Tessie spread her lunch on a drawing table opposite me\r\nand we drank our claret from the same bottle and lighted our cigarettes\r\nfrom the same match. I was very much attached to Tessie. I had watched\r\nher shoot up into a slender but exquisitely formed woman from a frail,\r\nawkward child. She had posed for me during the last three years, and\r\namong all my models she was my favourite. It would have troubled me\r\nvery much indeed had she become “tough” or “fly,” as the phrase goes,\r\nbut I never noticed any deterioration of her manner, and felt at heart\r\nthat she was all right. She and I never discussed morals at all, and\r\nI had no intention of doing so, partly because I had none myself, and\r\npartly because I knew she would do what she liked in spite of me. Still\r\nI did hope she would steer clear of complications, because I wished her\r\nwell, and then also I had a selfish desire to retain the best model I\r\nhad. I knew that mashing, as she termed it, had no significance with\r\ngirls like Tessie, and that such things in America did not resemble\r\nin the least the same things in Paris. Yet, having lived with my eyes\r\nopen, I also knew that somebody would take Tessie away some day, in\r\none manner or another, and though I professed to myself that marriage\r\nwas nonsense, I sincerely hoped that, in this case, there would be a\r\npriest at the end of the vista. I am a Catholic. When I listen to high\r\nmass, when I sign myself, I feel that everything, including myself, is\r\nmore cheerful, and when I confess, it does me good. A man who lives\r\nas much alone as I do, must confess to somebody. Then, again, Sylvia\r\nwas Catholic, and it was reason enough for me. But I was speaking of\r\nTessie, which is very different. Tessie also was Catholic and much\r\nmore devout than I, so, taking it all in all, I had little fear for my\r\npretty model until she should fall in love. But _then_ I knew that fate\r\nalone would decide her future for her, and I prayed inwardly that fate\r\nwould keep her away from men like me and throw into her path nothing\r\nbut Ed Burkes and Jimmy McCormicks, bless her sweet face!\r\n\r\nTessie sat blowing rings of smoke up to the ceiling and tinkling the\r\nice in her tumbler.\r\n\r\n“Do you know that I also had a dream last night?” I observed.\r\n\r\n“Not about that man,” she laughed.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. A dream similar to yours, only much worse.”\r\n\r\nIt was foolish and thoughtless of me to say this, but you know how\r\nlittle tact the average painter has. “I must have fallen asleep about\r\nten o’clock,” I continued, “and after a while I dreamt that I awoke. So\r\nplainly did I hear the midnight bells, the wind in the tree-branches,\r\nand the whistle of steamers from the bay, that even now I can scarcely\r\nbelieve I was not awake. I seemed to be lying in a box which had a\r\nglass cover. Dimly I saw the street lamps as I passed, for I must tell\r\nyou, Tessie, the box in which I reclined appeared to lie in a cushioned\r\nwagon which jolted me over a stony pavement. After a while I became\r\nimpatient and tried to move, but the box was too narrow. My hands were\r\ncrossed on my breast, so I could not raise them to help myself. I\r\nlistened and then tried to call. My voice was gone. I could hear the\r\ntrample of the horses attached to the wagon, and even the breathing of\r\nthe driver. Then another sound broke upon my ears like the raising of\r\na window sash. I managed to turn my head a little, and found I could\r\nlook, not only through the glass cover of my box, but also through the\r\nglass panes in the side of the covered vehicle. I saw houses, empty and\r\nsilent, with neither light nor life about any of them excepting one. In\r\nthat house a window was open on the first floor, and a figure all in\r\nwhite stood looking down into the street. It was you.”\r\n\r\nTessie had turned her face away from me and leaned on the table with\r\nher elbow.\r\n\r\n“I could see your face,” I resumed, “and it seemed to me to be very\r\nsorrowful. Then we passed on and turned into a narrow black lane.\r\nPresently the horses stopped. I waited and waited, closing my eyes with\r\nfear and impatience, but all was silent as the grave. After what seemed\r\nto me hours, I began to feel uncomfortable. A sense that somebody was\r\nclose to me made me unclose my eyes. Then I saw the white face of the\r\nhearse-driver looking at me through the coffin-lid——”\r\n\r\nA sob from Tessie interrupted me. She was trembling like a leaf. I saw\r\nI had made an ass of myself and attempted to repair the damage.\r\n\r\n“Why, Tess,” I said, “I only told you this to show you what influence\r\nyour story might have on another person’s dreams. You don’t suppose I\r\nreally lay in a coffin, do you? What are you trembling for? Don’t you\r\nsee that your dream and my unreasonable dislike for that inoffensive\r\nwatchman of the church simply set my brain working as soon as I fell\r\nasleep?”\r\n\r\nShe laid her head between her arms, and sobbed as if her heart would\r\nbreak. What a precious triple donkey I had made of myself! But I was\r\nabout to break my record. I went over and put my arm about her.\r\n\r\n“Tessie dear, forgive me,” I said; “I had no business to frighten you\r\nwith such nonsense. You are too sensible a girl, too good a Catholic to\r\nbelieve in dreams.”\r\n\r\nHer hand tightened on mine and her head fell back upon my shoulder, but\r\nshe still trembled and I petted her and comforted her.\r\n\r\n“Come, Tess, open your eyes and smile.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes opened with a slow languid movement and met mine, but their\r\nexpression was so queer that I hastened to reassure her again.\r\n\r\n“It’s all humbug, Tessie; you surely are not afraid that any harm will\r\ncome to you because of that.”\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, but her scarlet lips quivered.\r\n\r\n“Then, what’s the matter? Are you afraid?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Not for myself.”\r\n\r\n“For me, then?” I demanded gaily.\r\n\r\n“For you,” she murmured in a voice almost inaudible. “I—I care for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nAt first I started to laugh, but when I understood her, a shock\r\npassed through me, and I sat like one turned to stone. This was the\r\ncrowning bit of idiocy I had committed. During the moment which elapsed\r\nbetween her reply and my answer I thought of a thousand responses to\r\nthat innocent confession. I could pass it by with a laugh, I could\r\nmisunderstand her and assure her as to my health, I could simply point\r\nout that it was impossible she could love me. But my reply was quicker\r\nthan my thoughts, and I might think and think now when it was too late,\r\nfor I had kissed her on the mouth.\r\n\r\nThat evening I took my usual walk in Washington Park, pondering over\r\nthe occurrences of the day. I was thoroughly committed. There was no\r\nback out now, and I stared the future straight in the face. I was not\r\ngood, not even scrupulous, but I had no idea of deceiving either myself\r\nor Tessie. The one passion of my life lay buried in the sunlit forests\r\nof Brittany. Was it buried for ever? Hope cried “No!” For three years\r\nI had been listening to the voice of Hope, and for three years I had\r\nwaited for a footstep on my threshold. Had Sylvia forgotten? “No!”\r\ncried Hope.\r\n\r\nI said that I was no good. That is true, but still I was not exactly a\r\ncomic opera villain. I had led an easy-going reckless life, taking what\r\ninvited me of pleasure, deploring and sometimes bitterly regretting\r\nconsequences. In one thing alone, except my painting, was I serious,\r\nand that was something which lay hidden if not lost in the Breton\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nIt was too late for me to regret what had occurred during the day.\r\nWhatever it had been, pity, a sudden tenderness for sorrow, or the\r\nmore brutal instinct of gratified vanity, it was all the same now, and\r\nunless I wished to bruise an innocent heart, my path lay marked before\r\nme. The fire and strength, the depth of passion of a love which I had\r\nnever even suspected, with all my imagined experience in the world,\r\nleft me no alternative but to respond or send her away. Whether because\r\nI am so cowardly about giving pain to others, or whether it was that I\r\nhave little of the gloomy Puritan in me, I do not know, but I shrank\r\nfrom disclaiming responsibility for that thoughtless kiss, and in fact\r\nhad no time to do so before the gates of her heart opened and the flood\r\npoured forth. Others who habitually do their duty and find a sullen\r\nsatisfaction in making themselves and everybody else unhappy, might\r\nhave withstood it. I did not. I dared not. After the storm had abated I\r\ndid tell her that she might better have loved Ed Burke and worn a plain\r\ngold ring, but she would not hear of it, and I thought perhaps as long\r\nas she had decided to love somebody she could not marry, it had better\r\nbe me. I, at least, could treat her with an intelligent affection, and\r\nwhenever she became tired of her infatuation she could go none the\r\nworse for it. For I was decided on that point although I knew how hard\r\nit would be. I remembered the usual termination of Platonic liaisons,\r\nand thought how disgusted I had been whenever I heard of one. I knew I\r\nwas undertaking a great deal for so unscrupulous a man as I was, and I\r\ndreamed the future, but never for one moment did I doubt that she was\r\nsafe with me. Had it been anybody but Tessie I should not have bothered\r\nmy head about scruples. For it did not occur to me to sacrifice Tessie\r\nas I would have sacrificed a woman of the world. I looked the future\r\nsquarely in the face and saw the several probable endings to the\r\naffair. She would either tire of the whole thing, or become so unhappy\r\nthat I should have either to marry her or go away. If I married her we\r\nwould be unhappy. I with a wife unsuited to me, and she with a husband\r\nunsuitable for any woman. For my past life could scarcely entitle me\r\nto marry. If I went away she might either fall ill, recover, and marry\r\nsome Eddie Burke, or she might recklessly or deliberately go and do\r\nsomething foolish. On the other hand, if she tired of me, then her\r\nwhole life would be before her with beautiful vistas of Eddie Burkes\r\nand marriage rings and twins and Harlem flats and Heaven knows what. As\r\nI strolled along through the trees by the Washington Arch, I decided\r\nthat she should find a substantial friend in me, anyway, and the future\r\ncould take care of itself. Then I went into the house and put on my\r\nevening dress, for the little faintly-perfumed note on my dresser said,\r\n“Have a cab at the stage door at eleven,” and the note was signed\r\n“Edith Carmichel, Metropolitan Theatre.”\r\n\r\nI took supper that night, or rather we took supper, Miss Carmichel and\r\nI, at Solari’s, and the dawn was just beginning to gild the cross on\r\nthe Memorial Church as I entered Washington Square after leaving Edith\r\nat the Brunswick. There was not a soul in the park as I passed along\r\nthe trees and took the walk which leads from the Garibaldi statue to\r\nthe Hamilton Apartment House, but as I passed the churchyard I saw a\r\nfigure sitting on the stone steps. In spite of myself a chill crept\r\nover me at the sight of the white puffy face, and I hastened to pass.\r\nThen he said something which might have been addressed to me or might\r\nmerely have been a mutter to himself, but a sudden furious anger flamed\r\nup within me that such a creature should address me. For an instant I\r\nfelt like wheeling about and smashing my stick over his head, but I\r\nwalked on, and entering the Hamilton went to my apartment. For some\r\ntime I tossed about the bed trying to get the sound of his voice out\r\nof my ears, but could not. It filled my head, that muttering sound,\r\nlike thick oily smoke from a fat-rendering vat or an odour of noisome\r\ndecay. And as I lay and tossed about, the voice in my ears seemed more\r\ndistinct, and I began to understand the words he had muttered. They\r\ncame to me slowly as if I had forgotten them, and at last I could make\r\nsome sense out of the sounds. It was this:\r\n\r\n“Have you found the Yellow Sign?”\r\n\r\n“Have you found the Yellow Sign?”\r\n\r\n“Have you found the Yellow Sign?”\r\n\r\nI was furious. What did he mean by that? Then with a curse upon him and\r\nhis I rolled over and went to sleep, but when I awoke later I looked\r\npale and haggard, for I had dreamed the dream of the night before, and\r\nit troubled me more than I cared to think.\r\n\r\nI dressed and went down into my studio. Tessie sat by the window, but\r\nas I came in she rose and put both arms around my neck for an innocent\r\nkiss. She looked so sweet and dainty that I kissed her again and then\r\nsat down before the easel.\r\n\r\n“Hello! Where’s the study I began yesterday?” I asked.\r\n\r\nTessie looked conscious, but did not answer. I began to hunt among the\r\npiles of canvases, saying, “Hurry up, Tess, and get ready; we must take\r\nadvantage of the morning light.”\r\n\r\nWhen at last I gave up the search among the other canvases and turned\r\nto look around the room for the missing study I noticed Tessie standing\r\nby the screen with her clothes still on.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter,” I asked, “don’t you feel well?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then hurry.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want me to pose as—as I have always posed?”\r\n\r\nThen I understood. Here was a new complication. I had lost, of course,\r\nthe best nude model I had ever seen. I looked at Tessie. Her face was\r\nscarlet. Alas! Alas! We had eaten of the tree of knowledge, and Eden\r\nand native innocence were dreams of the past—I mean for her.\r\n\r\nI suppose she noticed the disappointment on my face, for she said: “I\r\nwill pose if you wish. The study is behind the screen here where I put\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said, “we will begin something new;” and I went into my\r\nwardrobe and picked out a Moorish costume which fairly blazed with\r\ntinsel. It was a genuine costume, and Tessie retired to the screen with\r\nit enchanted. When she came forth again I was astonished. Her long\r\nblack hair was bound above her forehead with a circlet of turquoises,\r\nand the ends, curled about her glittering girdle. Her feet were encased\r\nin the embroidered pointed slippers and the skirt of her costume,\r\ncuriously wrought with arabesques in silver, fell to her ankles. The\r\ndeep metallic blue vest embroidered with silver and the short Mauresque\r\njacket spangled and sewn with turquoises became her wonderfully. She\r\ncame up to me and held up her face smiling. I slipped my hand into my\r\npocket, and drawing out a gold chain with a cross attached, dropped it\r\nover her head.\r\n\r\n“It’s yours, Tessie.”\r\n\r\n“Mine?” she faltered.\r\n\r\n“Yours. Now go and pose,” Then with a radiant smile she ran behind the\r\nscreen and presently reappeared with a little box on which was written\r\nmy name.\r\n\r\n“I had intended to give it to you when I went home to-night,” she said,\r\n“but I can’t wait now.”\r\n\r\nI opened the box. On the pink cotton inside lay a clasp of black onyx,\r\non which was inlaid a curious symbol or letter in gold. It was neither\r\nArabic nor Chinese, nor, as I found afterwards, did it belong to any\r\nhuman script.\r\n\r\n“It’s all I had to give you for a keepsake,” she said timidly.\r\n\r\nI was annoyed, but I told her how much I should prize it, and promised\r\nto wear it always. She fastened it on my coat beneath the lapel.\r\n\r\n“How foolish, Tess, to go and buy me such a beautiful thing as this,” I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“I did not buy it,” she laughed.\r\n\r\n“Where did you get it?”\r\n\r\nThen she told me how she had found it one day while coming from the\r\nAquarium in the Battery, how she had advertised it and watched the\r\npapers, but at last gave up all hopes of finding the owner.\r\n\r\n“That was last winter,” she said, “the very day I had the first horrid\r\ndream about the hearse.”\r\n\r\nI remembered my dream of the previous night but said nothing, and\r\npresently my charcoal was flying over a new canvas, and Tessie stood\r\nmotionless on the model-stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nThe day following was a disastrous one for me. While moving a framed\r\ncanvas from one easel to another my foot slipped on the polished floor,\r\nand I fell heavily on both wrists. They were so badly sprained that it\r\nwas useless to attempt to hold a brush, and I was obliged to wander\r\nabout the studio, glaring at unfinished drawings and sketches, until\r\ndespair seized me and I sat down to smoke and twiddle my thumbs with\r\nrage. The rain blew against the windows and rattled on the roof of the\r\nchurch, driving me into a nervous fit with its interminable patter.\r\nTessie sat sewing by the window, and every now and then raised her head\r\nand looked at me with such innocent compassion that I began to feel\r\nashamed of my irritation and looked about for something to occupy me. I\r\nhad read all the papers and all the books in the library, but for the\r\nsake of something to do I went to the bookcases and shoved them open\r\nwith my elbow. I knew every volume by its colour and examined them all,\r\npassing slowly around the library and whistling to keep up my spirits.\r\nI was turning to go into the dining-room when my eye fell upon a book\r\nbound in serpent skin, standing in a corner of the top shelf of the\r\nlast bookcase. I did not remember it, and from the floor could not\r\ndecipher the pale lettering on the back, so I went to the smoking-room\r\nand called Tessie. She came in from the studio and climbed up to reach\r\nthe book.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“_The King in Yellow._”\r\n\r\nI was dumfounded. Who had placed it there? How came it in my rooms? I\r\nhad long ago decided that I should never open that book, and nothing on\r\nearth could have persuaded me to buy it. Fearful lest curiosity might\r\ntempt me to open it, I had never even looked at it in book-stores. If\r\nI ever had had any curiosity to read it, the awful tragedy of young\r\nCastaigne, whom I knew, prevented me from exploring its wicked pages.\r\nI had always refused to listen to any description of it, and indeed,\r\nnobody ever ventured to discuss the second part aloud, so I had\r\nabsolutely no knowledge of what those leaves might reveal. I stared at\r\nthe poisonous mottled binding as I would at a snake.\r\n\r\n“Don’t touch it, Tessie,” I said; “come down.”\r\n\r\nOf course my admonition was enough to arouse her curiosity, and before\r\nI could prevent it she took the book and, laughing, danced off into the\r\nstudio with it. I called to her, but she slipped away with a tormenting\r\nsmile at my helpless hands, and I followed her with some impatience.\r\n\r\n“Tessie!” I cried, entering the library, “listen, I am serious. Put\r\nthat book away. I do not wish you to open it!” The library was empty. I\r\nwent into both drawing-rooms, then into the bedrooms, laundry, kitchen,\r\nand finally returned to the library and began a systematic search.\r\nShe had hidden herself so well that it was half-an-hour later when I\r\ndiscovered her crouching white and silent by the latticed window in the\r\nstore-room above. At the first glance I saw she had been punished for\r\nher foolishness. _The King in Yellow_ lay at her feet, but the book was\r\nopen at the second part. I looked at Tessie and saw it was too late.\r\nShe had opened _The King in Yellow_. Then I took her by the hand and\r\nled her into the studio. She seemed dazed, and when I told her to lie\r\ndown on the sofa she obeyed me without a word. After a while she closed\r\nher eyes and her breathing became regular and deep, but I could not\r\ndetermine whether or not she slept. For a long while I sat silently\r\nbeside her, but she neither stirred nor spoke, and at last I rose, and,\r\nentering the unused store-room, took the book in my least injured hand.\r\nIt seemed heavy as lead, but I carried it into the studio again, and\r\nsitting down on the rug beside the sofa, opened it and read it through\r\nfrom beginning to end.\r\n\r\nWhen, faint with excess of my emotions, I dropped the volume and leaned\r\nwearily back against the sofa, Tessie opened her eyes and looked at me.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had been speaking for some time in a dull monotonous strain before\r\nI realized that we were discussing _The King in Yellow_. Oh the sin\r\nof writing such words,—words which are clear as crystal, limpid and\r\nmusical as bubbling springs, words which sparkle and glow like the\r\npoisoned diamonds of the Medicis! Oh the wickedness, the hopeless\r\ndamnation of a soul who could fascinate and paralyze human creatures\r\nwith such words,—words understood by the ignorant and wise alike,\r\nwords which are more precious than jewels, more soothing than music,\r\nmore awful than death!\r\n\r\nWe talked on, unmindful of the gathering shadows, and she was begging\r\nme to throw away the clasp of black onyx quaintly inlaid with\r\nwhat we now knew to be the Yellow Sign. I never shall know why I\r\nrefused, though even at this hour, here in my bedroom as I write this\r\nconfession, I should be glad to know _what_ it was that prevented me\r\nfrom tearing the Yellow Sign from my breast and casting it into the\r\nfire. I am sure I wished to do so, and yet Tessie pleaded with me in\r\nvain. Night fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to\r\neach other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from\r\nthe misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of\r\nCassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes\r\nas the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.\r\n\r\nThe house was very silent now, and not a sound came up from the misty\r\nstreets. Tessie lay among the cushions, her face a grey blot in the\r\ngloom, but her hands were clasped in mine, and I knew that she knew and\r\nread my thoughts as I read hers, for we had understood the mystery of\r\nthe Hyades and the Phantom of Truth was laid. Then as we answered each\r\nother, swiftly, silently, thought on thought, the shadows stirred in\r\nthe gloom about us, and far in the distant streets we heard a sound.\r\nNearer and nearer it came, the dull crunching of wheels, nearer and\r\nyet nearer, and now, outside before the door it ceased, and I dragged\r\nmyself to the window and saw a black-plumed hearse. The gate below\r\nopened and shut, and I crept shaking to my door and bolted it, but I\r\nknew no bolts, no locks, could keep that creature out who was coming\r\nfor the Yellow Sign. And now I heard him moving very softly along the\r\nhall. Now he was at the door, and the bolts rotted at his touch. Now\r\nhe had entered. With eyes starting from my head I peered into the\r\ndarkness, but when he came into the room I did not see him. It was only\r\nwhen I felt him envelope me in his cold soft grasp that I cried out\r\nand struggled with deadly fury, but my hands were useless and he tore\r\nthe onyx clasp from my coat and struck me full in the face. Then, as\r\nI fell, I heard Tessie’s soft cry and her spirit fled: and even while\r\nfalling I longed to follow her, for I knew that the King in Yellow had\r\nopened his tattered mantle and there was only God to cry to now.\r\n\r\nI could tell more, but I cannot see what help it will be to the world.\r\nAs for me, I am past human help or hope. As I lie here, writing,\r\ncareless even whether or not I die before I finish, I can see the\r\ndoctor gathering up his powders and phials with a vague gesture to the\r\ngood priest beside me, which I understand.\r\n\r\nThey will be very curious to know the tragedy—they of the outside\r\nworld who write books and print millions of newspapers, but I shall\r\nwrite no more, and the father confessor will seal my last words with\r\nthe seal of sanctity when his holy office is done. They of the outside\r\nworld may send their creatures into wrecked homes and death-smitten\r\nfiresides, and their newspapers will batten on blood and tears, but\r\nwith me their spies must halt before the confessional. They know that\r\nTessie is dead and that I am dying. They know how the people in the\r\nhouse, aroused by an infernal scream, rushed into my room and found\r\none living and two dead, but they do not know what I shall tell them\r\nnow; they do not know that the doctor said as he pointed to a horrible\r\ndecomposed heap on the floor—the livid corpse of the watchman from the\r\nchurch: “I have no theory, no explanation. That man must have been dead\r\nfor months!”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI think I am dying. I wish the priest would—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE DEMOISELLE D’YS\r\n\r\n    “Mais je croy que je\r\n     Suis descendu on puiz\r\n     Ténébreux onquel disoit\r\n     Heraclytus estre Vereté cachée.”\r\n\r\n  “There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four\r\n  which I know not:\r\n\r\n  “The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock;\r\n  the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man\r\n  with a maid.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nThe utter desolation of the scene began to have its effect; I sat down\r\nto face the situation and, if possible, recall to mind some landmark\r\nwhich might aid me in extricating myself from my present position. If\r\nI could only find the ocean again all would be clear, for I knew one\r\ncould see the island of Groix from the cliffs.\r\n\r\nI laid down my gun, and kneeling behind a rock lighted a pipe. Then I\r\nlooked at my watch. It was nearly four o’clock. I might have wandered\r\nfar from Kerselec since daybreak.\r\n\r\nStanding the day before on the cliffs below Kerselec with Goulven,\r\nlooking out over the sombre moors among which I had now lost my way,\r\nthese downs had appeared to me level as a meadow, stretching to the\r\nhorizon, and although I knew how deceptive is distance, I could not\r\nrealize that what from Kerselec seemed to be mere grassy hollows were\r\ngreat valleys covered with gorse and heather, and what looked like\r\nscattered boulders were in reality enormous cliffs of granite.\r\n\r\n“It’s a bad place for a stranger,” old Goulven had said: “you’d better\r\ntake a guide;” and I had replied, “I shall not lose myself.” Now I\r\nknew that I had lost myself, as I sat there smoking, with the sea-wind\r\nblowing in my face. On every side stretched the moorland, covered with\r\nflowering gorse and heath and granite boulders. There was not a tree\r\nin sight, much less a house. After a while, I picked up the gun, and\r\nturning my back on the sun tramped on again.\r\n\r\nThere was little use in following any of the brawling streams which\r\nevery now and then crossed my path, for, instead of flowing into the\r\nsea, they ran inland to reedy pools in the hollows of the moors. I\r\nhad followed several, but they all led me to swamps or silent little\r\nponds from which the snipe rose peeping and wheeled away in an ecstasy\r\nof fright. I began to feel fatigued, and the gun galled my shoulder in\r\nspite of the double pads. The sun sank lower and lower, shining level\r\nacross yellow gorse and the moorland pools.\r\n\r\nAs I walked my own gigantic shadow led me on, seeming to lengthen at\r\nevery step. The gorse scraped against my leggings, crackled beneath\r\nmy feet, showering the brown earth with blossoms, and the brake bowed\r\nand billowed along my path. From tufts of heath rabbits scurried away\r\nthrough the bracken, and among the swamp grass I heard the wild duck’s\r\ndrowsy quack. Once a fox stole across my path, and again, as I stooped\r\nto drink at a hurrying rill, a heron flapped heavily from the reeds\r\nbeside me. I turned to look at the sun. It seemed to touch the edges\r\nof the plain. When at last I decided that it was useless to go on, and\r\nthat I must make up my mind to spend at least one night on the moors, I\r\nthrew myself down thoroughly fagged out. The evening sunlight slanted\r\nwarm across my body, but the sea-winds began to rise, and I felt a\r\nchill strike through me from my wet shooting-boots. High overhead gulls\r\nwere wheeling and tossing like bits of white paper; from some distant\r\nmarsh a solitary curlew called. Little by little the sun sank into the\r\nplain, and the zenith flushed with the after-glow. I watched the sky\r\nchange from palest gold to pink and then to smouldering fire. Clouds\r\nof midges danced above me, and high in the calm air a bat dipped and\r\nsoared. My eyelids began to droop. Then as I shook off the drowsiness\r\na sudden crash among the bracken roused me. I raised my eyes. A great\r\nbird hung quivering in the air above my face. For an instant I stared,\r\nincapable of motion; then something leaped past me in the ferns and the\r\nbird rose, wheeled, and pitched headlong into the brake.\r\n\r\nI was on my feet in an instant peering through the gorse. There came\r\nthe sound of a struggle from a bunch of heather close by, and then\r\nall was quiet. I stepped forward, my gun poised, but when I came to\r\nthe heather the gun fell under my arm again, and I stood motionless\r\nin silent astonishment. A dead hare lay on the ground, and on the hare\r\nstood a magnificent falcon, one talon buried in the creature’s neck,\r\nthe other planted firmly on its limp flank. But what astonished me,\r\nwas not the mere sight of a falcon sitting upon its prey. I had seen\r\nthat more than once. It was that the falcon was fitted with a sort of\r\nleash about both talons, and from the leash hung a round bit of metal\r\nlike a sleigh-bell. The bird turned its fierce yellow eyes on me, and\r\nthen stooped and struck its curved beak into the quarry. At the same\r\ninstant hurried steps sounded among the heather, and a girl sprang\r\ninto the covert in front. Without a glance at me she walked up to the\r\nfalcon, and passing her gloved hand under its breast, raised it from\r\nthe quarry. Then she deftly slipped a small hood over the bird’s head,\r\nand holding it out on her gauntlet, stooped and picked up the hare.\r\n\r\nShe passed a cord about the animal’s legs and fastened the end of the\r\nthong to her girdle. Then she started to retrace her steps through\r\nthe covert. As she passed me I raised my cap and she acknowledged\r\nmy presence with a scarcely perceptible inclination. I had been so\r\nastonished, so lost in admiration of the scene before my eyes, that it\r\nhad not occurred to me that here was my salvation. But as she moved\r\naway I recollected that unless I wanted to sleep on a windy moor that\r\nnight I had better recover my speech without delay. At my first word\r\nshe hesitated, and as I stepped before her I thought a look of fear\r\ncame into her beautiful eyes. But as I humbly explained my unpleasant\r\nplight, her face flushed and she looked at me in wonder.\r\n\r\n“Surely you did not come from Kerselec!” she repeated.\r\n\r\nHer sweet voice had no trace of the Breton accent nor of any accent\r\nwhich I knew, and yet there was something in it I seemed to have heard\r\nbefore, something quaint and indefinable, like the theme of an old song.\r\n\r\nI explained that I was an American, unacquainted with Finistère,\r\nshooting there for my own amusement.\r\n\r\n“An American,” she repeated in the same quaint musical tones. “I have\r\nnever before seen an American.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment she stood silent, then looking at me she said. “If you\r\nshould walk all night you could not reach Kerselec now, even if you had\r\na guide.”\r\n\r\nThis was pleasant news.\r\n\r\n“But,” I began, “if I could only find a peasant’s hut where I might get\r\nsomething to eat, and shelter.”\r\n\r\nThe falcon on her wrist fluttered and shook its head. The girl smoothed\r\nits glossy back and glanced at me.\r\n\r\n“Look around,” she said gently. “Can you see the end of these moors?\r\nLook, north, south, east, west. Can you see anything but moorland and\r\nbracken?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said.\r\n\r\n“The moor is wild and desolate. It is easy to enter, but sometimes they\r\nwho enter never leave it. There are no peasants’ huts here.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “if you will tell me in which direction Kerselec lies,\r\nto-morrow it will take me no longer to go back than it has to come.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me again with an expression almost like pity.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” she said, “to come is easy and takes hours; to go is\r\ndifferent—and may take centuries.”\r\n\r\nI stared at her in amazement but decided that I had misunderstood her.\r\nThen before I had time to speak she drew a whistle from her belt and\r\nsounded it.\r\n\r\n“Sit down and rest,” she said to me; “you have come a long distance and\r\nare tired.”\r\n\r\nShe gathered up her pleated skirts and motioning me to follow picked\r\nher dainty way through the gorse to a flat rock among the ferns.\r\n\r\n“They will be here directly,” she said, and taking a seat at one end of\r\nthe rock invited me to sit down on the other edge. The after-glow was\r\nbeginning to fade in the sky and a single star twinkled faintly through\r\nthe rosy haze. A long wavering triangle of water-fowl drifted southward\r\nover our heads, and from the swamps around plover were calling.\r\n\r\n“They are very beautiful—these moors,” she said quietly.\r\n\r\n“Beautiful, but cruel to strangers,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Beautiful and cruel,” she repeated dreamily, “beautiful and cruel.”\r\n\r\n“Like a woman,” I said stupidly.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she cried with a little catch in her breath, and looked at me.\r\nHer dark eyes met mine, and I thought she seemed angry or frightened.\r\n\r\n“Like a woman,” she repeated under her breath, “How cruel to say so!”\r\nThen after a pause, as though speaking aloud to herself, “How cruel for\r\nhim to say that!”\r\n\r\nI don’t know what sort of an apology I offered for my inane, though\r\nharmless speech, but I know that she seemed so troubled about it that I\r\nbegan to think I had said something very dreadful without knowing it,\r\nand remembered with horror the pitfalls and snares which the French\r\nlanguage sets for foreigners. While I was trying to imagine what I\r\nmight have said, a sound of voices came across the moor, and the girl\r\nrose to her feet.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, with a trace of a smile on her pale face, “I will not\r\naccept your apologies, monsieur, but I must prove you wrong, and that\r\nshall be my revenge. Look. Here come Hastur and Raoul.”\r\n\r\nTwo men loomed up in the twilight. One had a sack across his shoulders\r\nand the other carried a hoop before him as a waiter carries a tray. The\r\nhoop was fastened with straps to his shoulders, and around the edge of\r\nthe circlet sat three hooded falcons fitted with tinkling bells. The\r\ngirl stepped up to the falconer, and with a quick turn of her wrist\r\ntransferred her falcon to the hoop, where it quickly sidled off and\r\nnestled among its mates, who shook their hooded heads and ruffled their\r\nfeathers till the belled jesses tinkled again. The other man stepped\r\nforward and bowing respectfully took up the hare and dropped it into\r\nthe game-sack.\r\n\r\n“These are my piqueurs,” said the girl, turning to me with a gentle\r\ndignity. “Raoul is a good fauconnier, and I shall some day make him\r\ngrand veneur. Hastur is incomparable.”\r\n\r\nThe two silent men saluted me respectfully.\r\n\r\n“Did I not tell you, monsieur, that I should prove you wrong?” she\r\ncontinued. “This, then, is my revenge, that you do me the courtesy of\r\naccepting food and shelter at my own house.”\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer she spoke to the falconers, who started instantly\r\nacross the heath, and with a gracious gesture to me she followed. I\r\ndon’t know whether I made her understand how profoundly grateful I\r\nfelt, but she seemed pleased to listen, as we walked over the dewy\r\nheather.\r\n\r\n“Are you not very tired?” she asked.\r\n\r\nI had clean forgotten my fatigue in her presence, and I told her so.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think your gallantry is a little old-fashioned?” she said;\r\nand when I looked confused and humbled, she added quietly, “Oh, I like\r\nit, I like everything old-fashioned, and it is delightful to hear you\r\nsay such pretty things.”\r\n\r\nThe moorland around us was very still now under its ghostly sheet\r\nof mist. The plovers had ceased their calling; the crickets and all\r\nthe little creatures of the fields were silent as we passed, yet it\r\nseemed to me as if I could hear them beginning again far behind us.\r\nWell in advance, the two tall falconers strode across the heather, and\r\nthe faint jingling of the hawks’ bells came to our ears in distant\r\nmurmuring chimes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a splendid hound dashed out of the mist in front, followed\r\nby another and another until half-a-dozen or more were bounding and\r\nleaping around the girl beside me. She caressed and quieted them with\r\nher gloved hand, speaking to them in quaint terms which I remembered to\r\nhave seen in old French manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThen the falcons on the circlet borne by the falconer ahead began\r\nto beat their wings and scream, and from somewhere out of sight the\r\nnotes of a hunting-horn floated across the moor. The hounds sprang\r\naway before us and vanished in the twilight, the falcons flapped and\r\nsquealed upon their perch, and the girl, taking up the song of the\r\nhorn, began to hum. Clear and mellow her voice sounded in the night air.\r\n\r\n    “Chasseur, chasseur, chassez encore,\r\n     Quittez Rosette et Jeanneton,\r\n     Tonton, tonton, tontaine, tonton,\r\n     Ou, pour, rabattre, dès l’aurore,\r\n     Que les Amours soient de planton,\r\n     Tonton, tontaine, tonton.”\r\n\r\nAs I listened to her lovely voice a grey mass which rapidly grew more\r\ndistinct loomed up in front, and the horn rang out joyously through the\r\ntumult of the hounds and falcons. A torch glimmered at a gate, a light\r\nstreamed through an opening door, and we stepped upon a wooden bridge\r\nwhich trembled under our feet and rose creaking and straining behind\r\nus as we passed over the moat and into a small stone court, walled on\r\nevery side. From an open doorway a man came and, bending in salutation,\r\npresented a cup to the girl beside me. She took the cup and touched it\r\nwith her lips, then lowering it turned to me and said in a low voice,\r\n“I bid you welcome.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment one of the falconers came with another cup, but before\r\nhanding it to me, presented it to the girl, who tasted it. The falconer\r\nmade a gesture to receive it, but she hesitated a moment, and then,\r\nstepping forward, offered me the cup with her own hands. I felt this\r\nto be an act of extraordinary graciousness, but hardly knew what was\r\nexpected of me, and did not raise it to my lips at once. The girl\r\nflushed crimson. I saw that I must act quickly.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” I faltered, “a stranger whom you have saved from\r\ndangers he may never realize empties this cup to the gentlest and\r\nloveliest hostess of France.”\r\n\r\n“In His name,” she murmured, crossing herself as I drained the cup.\r\nThen stepping into the doorway she turned to me with a pretty gesture\r\nand, taking my hand in hers, led me into the house, saying again and\r\nagain: “You are very welcome, indeed you are welcome to the Château\r\nd’Ys.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nI awoke next morning with the music of the horn in my ears, and leaping\r\nout of the ancient bed, went to a curtained window where the sunlight\r\nfiltered through little deep-set panes. The horn ceased as I looked\r\ninto the court below.\r\n\r\nA man who might have been brother to the two falconers of the night\r\nbefore stood in the midst of a pack of hounds. A curved horn was\r\nstrapped over his back, and in his hand he held a long-lashed whip. The\r\ndogs whined and yelped, dancing around him in anticipation; there was\r\nthe stamp of horses, too, in the walled yard.\r\n\r\n“Mount!” cried a voice in Breton, and with a clatter of hoofs the two\r\nfalconers, with falcons upon their wrists, rode into the courtyard\r\namong the hounds. Then I heard another voice which sent the blood\r\nthrobbing through my heart: “Piriou Louis, hunt the hounds well and\r\nspare neither spur nor whip. Thou Raoul and thou Gaston, see that the\r\n_epervier_ does not prove himself _niais_, and if it be best in your\r\njudgment, _faites courtoisie à l’oiseau. Jardiner un oiseau_, like\r\nthe _mué_ there on Hastur’s wrist, is not difficult, but thou, Raoul,\r\nmayest not find it so simple to govern that _hagard_. Twice last week\r\nhe foamed _au vif_ and lost the _beccade_ although he is used to the\r\n_leurre_. The bird acts like a stupid _branchier_. _Paître un hagard\r\nn’est pas si facile._”\r\n\r\nWas I dreaming? The old language of falconry which I had read in\r\nyellow manuscripts—the old forgotten French of the middle ages was\r\nsounding in my ears while the hounds bayed and the hawks’ bells tinkled\r\naccompaniment to the stamping horses. She spoke again in the sweet\r\nforgotten language:\r\n\r\n“If you would rather attach the _longe_ and leave thy _hagard au bloc_,\r\nRaoul, I shall say nothing; for it were a pity to spoil so fair a day’s\r\nsport with an ill-trained _sors_. _Essimer abaisser_,—it is possibly\r\nthe best way. _Ça lui donnera des reins._ I was perhaps hasty with the\r\nbird. It takes time to pass _à la filière_ and the exercises _d’escap_.”\r\n\r\nThen the falconer Raoul bowed in his stirrups and replied: “If it be\r\nthe pleasure of Mademoiselle, I shall keep the hawk.”\r\n\r\n“It is my wish,” she answered. “Falconry I know, but you have yet to\r\ngive me many a lesson in _Autourserie_, my poor Raoul. Sieur Piriou\r\nLouis mount!”\r\n\r\nThe huntsman sprang into an archway and in an instant returned, mounted\r\nupon a strong black horse, followed by a piqueur also mounted.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she cried joyously, “speed Glemarec René! speed! speed all! Sound\r\nthy horn, Sieur Piriou!”\r\n\r\nThe silvery music of the hunting-horn filled the courtyard, the hounds\r\nsprang through the gateway and galloping hoof-beats plunged out of the\r\npaved court; loud on the drawbridge, suddenly muffled, then lost in the\r\nheather and bracken of the moors. Distant and more distant sounded the\r\nhorn, until it became so faint that the sudden carol of a soaring lark\r\ndrowned it in my ears. I heard the voice below responding to some call\r\nfrom within the house.\r\n\r\n“I do not regret the chase, I will go another time. Courtesy to the\r\nstranger, Pelagie, remember!”\r\n\r\nAnd a feeble voice came quavering from within the house, “_Courtoisie_.”\r\n\r\nI stripped, and rubbed myself from head to foot in the huge earthen\r\nbasin of icy water which stood upon the stone floor at the foot of\r\nmy bed. Then I looked about for my clothes. They were gone, but on a\r\nsettle near the door lay a heap of garments which I inspected with\r\nastonishment. As my clothes had vanished, I was compelled to attire\r\nmyself in the costume which had evidently been placed there for me to\r\nwear while my own clothes dried. Everything was there, cap, shoes, and\r\nhunting doublet of silvery grey homespun; but the close-fitting costume\r\nand seamless shoes belonged to another century, and I remembered\r\nthe strange costumes of the three falconers in the courtyard. I was\r\nsure that it was not the modern dress of any portion of France or\r\nBrittany; but not until I was dressed and stood before a mirror between\r\nthe windows did I realize that I was clothed much more like a young\r\nhuntsman of the middle ages than like a Breton of that day. I hesitated\r\nand picked up the cap. Should I go down and present myself in that\r\nstrange guise? There seemed to be no help for it, my own clothes were\r\ngone and there was no bell in the ancient chamber to call a servant; so\r\nI contented myself with removing a short hawk’s feather from the cap,\r\nand, opening the door, went downstairs.\r\n\r\nBy the fireplace in the large room at the foot of the stairs an old\r\nBreton woman sat spinning with a distaff. She looked up at me when\r\nI appeared, and, smiling frankly, wished me health in the Breton\r\nlanguage, to which I laughingly replied in French. At the same\r\nmoment my hostess appeared and returned my salutation with a grace\r\nand dignity that sent a thrill to my heart. Her lovely head with its\r\ndark curly hair was crowned with a head-dress which set all doubts\r\nas to the epoch of my own costume at rest. Her slender figure was\r\nexquisitely set off in the homespun hunting-gown edged with silver,\r\nand on her gauntlet-covered wrist she bore one of her petted hawks.\r\nWith perfect simplicity she took my hand and led me into the garden in\r\nthe court, and seating herself before a table invited me very sweetly\r\nto sit beside her. Then she asked me in her soft quaint accent how I\r\nhad passed the night, and whether I was very much inconvenienced by\r\nwearing the clothes which old Pelagie had put there for me while I\r\nslept. I looked at my own clothes and shoes, drying in the sun by the\r\ngarden-wall, and hated them. What horrors they were compared with the\r\ngraceful costume which I now wore! I told her this laughing, but she\r\nagreed with me very seriously.\r\n\r\n“We will throw them away,” she said in a quiet voice. In my\r\nastonishment I attempted to explain that I not only could not think of\r\naccepting clothes from anybody, although for all I knew it might be the\r\ncustom of hospitality in that part of the country, but that I should\r\ncut an impossible figure if I returned to France clothed as I was then.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and tossed her pretty head, saying something in old French\r\nwhich I did not understand, and then Pelagie trotted out with a tray on\r\nwhich stood two bowls of milk, a loaf of white bread, fruit, a platter\r\nof honey-comb, and a flagon of deep red wine. “You see I have not yet\r\nbroken my fast because I wished you to eat with me. But I am very\r\nhungry,” she smiled.\r\n\r\n“I would rather die than forget one word of what you have said!” I\r\nblurted out, while my cheeks burned. “She will think me mad,” I added\r\nto myself, but she turned to me with sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she murmured. “Then Monsieur knows all that there is of\r\nchivalry—”\r\n\r\nShe crossed herself and broke bread. I sat and watched her white hands,\r\nnot daring to raise my eyes to hers.\r\n\r\n“Will you not eat?” she asked. “Why do you look so troubled?”\r\n\r\nAh, why? I knew it now. I knew I would give my life to touch with my\r\nlips those rosy palms—I understood now that from the moment when I\r\nlooked into her dark eyes there on the moor last night I had loved her.\r\nMy great and sudden passion held me speechless.\r\n\r\n“Are you ill at ease?” she asked again.\r\n\r\nThen, like a man who pronounces his own doom, I answered in a low\r\nvoice: “Yes, I am ill at ease for love of you.” And as she did not\r\nstir nor answer, the same power moved my lips in spite of me and I\r\nsaid, “I, who am unworthy of the lightest of your thoughts, I who abuse\r\nhospitality and repay your gentle courtesy with bold presumption, I\r\nlove you.”\r\n\r\nShe leaned her head upon her hands, and answered softly, “I love you.\r\nYour words are very dear to me. I love you.”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall win you.”\r\n\r\n“Win me,” she replied.\r\n\r\nBut all the time I had been sitting silent, my face turned toward her.\r\nShe, also silent, her sweet face resting on her upturned palm, sat\r\nfacing me, and as her eyes looked into mine I knew that neither she nor\r\nI had spoken human speech; but I knew that her soul had answered mine,\r\nand I drew myself up feeling youth and joyous love coursing through\r\nevery vein. She, with a bright colour in her lovely face, seemed as\r\none awakened from a dream, and her eyes sought mine with a questioning\r\nglance which made me tremble with delight. We broke our fast, speaking\r\nof ourselves. I told her my name and she told me hers, the Demoiselle\r\nJeanne d’Ys.\r\n\r\nShe spoke of her father and mother’s death, and how the nineteen of\r\nher years had been passed in the little fortified farm alone with her\r\nnurse Pelagie, Glemarec René the piqueur, and the four falconers,\r\nRaoul, Gaston, Hastur, and the Sieur Piriou Louis, who had served her\r\nfather. She had never been outside the moorland—never even had seen a\r\nhuman soul before, except the falconers and Pelagie. She did not know\r\nhow she had heard of Kerselec; perhaps the falconers had spoken of it.\r\nShe knew the legends of Loup Garou and Jeanne la Flamme from her nurse\r\nPelagie. She embroidered and spun flax. Her hawks and hounds were her\r\nonly distraction. When she had met me there on the moor she had been\r\nso frightened that she almost dropped at the sound of my voice. She\r\nhad, it was true, seen ships at sea from the cliffs, but as far as\r\nthe eye could reach the moors over which she galloped were destitute\r\nof any sign of human life. There was a legend which old Pelagie told,\r\nhow anybody once lost in the unexplored moorland might never return,\r\nbecause the moors were enchanted. She did not know whether it was true,\r\nshe never had thought about it until she met me. She did not know\r\nwhether the falconers had even been outside, or whether they could go\r\nif they would. The books in the house which Pelagie, the nurse, had\r\ntaught her to read were hundreds of years old.\r\n\r\nAll this she told me with a sweet seriousness seldom seen in any one\r\nbut children. My own name she found easy to pronounce, and insisted,\r\nbecause my first name was Philip, I must have French blood in me. She\r\ndid not seem curious to learn anything about the outside world, and\r\nI thought perhaps she considered it had forfeited her interest and\r\nrespect from the stories of her nurse.\r\n\r\nWe were still sitting at the table, and she was throwing grapes to the\r\nsmall field birds which came fearlessly to our very feet.\r\n\r\nI began to speak in a vague way of going, but she would not hear of it,\r\nand before I knew it I had promised to stay a week and hunt with hawk\r\nand hound in their company. I also obtained permission to come again\r\nfrom Kerselec and visit her after my return.\r\n\r\n“Why,” she said innocently, “I do not know what I should do if you\r\nnever came back;” and I, knowing that I had no right to awaken her with\r\nthe sudden shock which the avowal of my own love would bring to her,\r\nsat silent, hardly daring to breathe.\r\n\r\n“You will come very often?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Very often,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Every day?”\r\n\r\n“Every day.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she sighed, “I am very happy. Come and see my hawks.”\r\n\r\nShe rose and took my hand again with a childlike innocence of\r\npossession, and we walked through the garden and fruit trees to a\r\ngrassy lawn which was bordered by a brook. Over the lawn were scattered\r\nfifteen or twenty stumps of trees—partially imbedded in the grass—and\r\nupon all of these except two sat falcons. They were attached to the\r\nstumps by thongs which were in turn fastened with steel rivets to their\r\nlegs just above the talons. A little stream of pure spring water flowed\r\nin a winding course within easy distance of each perch.\r\n\r\nThe birds set up a clamour when the girl appeared, but she went from\r\none to another, caressing some, taking others for an instant upon her\r\nwrist, or stooping to adjust their jesses.\r\n\r\n“Are they not pretty?” she said. “See, here is a falcon-gentil. We call\r\nit ‘ignoble,’ because it takes the quarry in direct chase. This is a\r\nblue falcon. In falconry we call it ‘noble’ because it rises over the\r\nquarry, and wheeling, drops upon it from above. This white bird is a\r\ngerfalcon from the north. It is also ‘noble!’ Here is a merlin, and\r\nthis tiercelet is a falcon-heroner.”\r\n\r\nI asked her how she had learned the old language of falconry. She did\r\nnot remember, but thought her father must have taught it to her when\r\nshe was very young.\r\n\r\nThen she led me away and showed me the young falcons still in the nest.\r\n“They are termed _niais_ in falconry,” she explained. “A _branchier_ is\r\nthe young bird which is just able to leave the nest and hop from branch\r\nto branch. A young bird which has not yet moulted is called a _sors_,\r\nand a _mué_ is a hawk which has moulted in captivity. When we catch a\r\nwild falcon which has changed its plumage we term it a _hagard_. Raoul\r\nfirst taught me to dress a falcon. Shall I teach you how it is done?”\r\n\r\nShe seated herself on the bank of the stream among the falcons and I\r\nthrew myself at her feet to listen.\r\n\r\nThen the Demoiselle d’Ys held up one rosy-tipped finger and began very\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n“First one must catch the falcon.”\r\n\r\n“I am caught,” I answered.\r\n\r\nShe laughed very prettily and told me my _dressage_ would perhaps be\r\ndifficult, as I was noble.\r\n\r\n“I am already tamed,” I replied; “jessed and belled.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed, delighted. “Oh, my brave falcon; then you will return at\r\nmy call?”\r\n\r\n“I am yours,” I answered gravely.\r\n\r\nShe sat silent for a moment. Then the colour heightened in her cheeks\r\nand she held up her finger again, saying, “Listen; I wish to speak of\r\nfalconry—”\r\n\r\n“I listen, Countess Jeanne d’Ys.”\r\n\r\nBut again she fell into the reverie, and her eyes seemed fixed on\r\nsomething beyond the summer clouds.\r\n\r\n“Philip,” she said at last.\r\n\r\n“Jeanne,” I whispered.\r\n\r\n“That is all,—that is what I wished,” she sighed,—“Philip and Jeanne.”\r\n\r\nShe held her hand toward me and I touched it with my lips.\r\n\r\n“Win me,” she said, but this time it was the body and soul which spoke\r\nin unison.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she began again: “Let us speak of falconry.”\r\n\r\n“Begin,” I replied; “we have caught the falcon.”\r\n\r\nThen Jeanne d’Ys took my hand in both of hers and told me how with\r\ninfinite patience the young falcon was taught to perch upon the wrist,\r\nhow little by little it became used to the belled jesses and the\r\n_chaperon à cornette_.\r\n\r\n“They must first have a good appetite,” she said; “then little by\r\nlittle I reduce their nourishment; which in falconry we call _pât_.\r\nWhen, after many nights passed _au bloc_ as these birds are now, I\r\nprevail upon the _hagard_ to stay quietly on the wrist, then the bird\r\nis ready to be taught to come for its food. I fix the _pât_ to the end\r\nof a thong, or _leurre_, and teach the bird to come to me as soon as\r\nI begin to whirl the cord in circles about my head. At first I drop\r\nthe _pât_ when the falcon comes, and he eats the food on the ground.\r\nAfter a little he will learn to seize the _leurre_ in motion as I whirl\r\nit around my head or drag it over the ground. After this it is easy\r\nto teach the falcon to strike at game, always remembering to _‘faire\r\ncourtoisie á l’oiseau’_, that is, to allow the bird to taste the\r\nquarry.”\r\n\r\nA squeal from one of the falcons interrupted her, and she arose to\r\nadjust the _longe_ which had become whipped about the _bloc_, but the\r\nbird still flapped its wings and screamed.\r\n\r\n“What _is_ the matter?” she said. “Philip, can you see?”\r\n\r\nI looked around and at first saw nothing to cause the commotion, which\r\nwas now heightened by the screams and flapping of all the birds. Then\r\nmy eye fell upon the flat rock beside the stream from which the girl\r\nhad risen. A grey serpent was moving slowly across the surface of the\r\nboulder, and the eyes in its flat triangular head sparkled like jet.\r\n\r\n“A couleuvre,” she said quietly.\r\n\r\n“It is harmless, is it not?” I asked.\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the black V-shaped figure on the neck.\r\n\r\n“It is certain death,” she said; “it is a viper.”\r\n\r\nWe watched the reptile moving slowly over the smooth rock to where the\r\nsunlight fell in a broad warm patch.\r\n\r\nI started forward to examine it, but she clung to my arm crying,\r\n“Don’t, Philip, I am afraid.”\r\n\r\n“For me?”\r\n\r\n“For you, Philip,—I love you.”\r\n\r\nThen I took her in my arms and kissed her on the lips, but all I could\r\nsay was: “Jeanne, Jeanne, Jeanne.” And as she lay trembling on my\r\nbreast, something struck my foot in the grass below, but I did not heed\r\nit. Then again something struck my ankle, and a sharp pain shot through\r\nme. I looked into the sweet face of Jeanne d’Ys and kissed her, and\r\nwith all my strength lifted her in my arms and flung her from me. Then\r\nbending, I tore the viper from my ankle and set my heel upon its head.\r\nI remember feeling weak and numb,—I remember falling to the ground.\r\nThrough my slowly glazing eyes I saw Jeanne’s white face bending close\r\nto mine, and when the light in my eyes went out I still felt her arms\r\nabout my neck, and her soft cheek against my drawn lips.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I opened my eyes, I looked around in terror. Jeanne was gone. I\r\nsaw the stream and the flat rock; I saw the crushed viper in the grass\r\nbeside me, but the hawks and _blocs_ had disappeared. I sprang to my\r\nfeet. The garden, the fruit trees, the drawbridge and the walled court\r\nwere gone. I stared stupidly at a heap of crumbling ruins, ivy-covered\r\nand grey, through which great trees had pushed their way. I crept\r\nforward, dragging my numbed foot, and as I moved, a falcon sailed from\r\nthe tree-tops among the ruins, and soaring, mounting in narrowing\r\ncircles, faded and vanished in the clouds above.\r\n\r\n“Jeanne, Jeanne,” I cried, but my voice died on my lips, and I fell\r\non my knees among the weeds. And as God willed it, I, not knowing,\r\nhad fallen kneeling before a crumbling shrine carved in stone for our\r\nMother of Sorrows. I saw the sad face of the Virgin wrought in the cold\r\nstone. I saw the cross and thorns at her feet, and beneath it I read:\r\n\r\n                        “PRAY FOR THE SOUL OF THE\r\n                         DEMOISELLE JEANNE D’Ys,\r\n                                WHO DIED\r\n                        IN HER YOUTH FOR LOVE OF\r\n                           PHILIP, A STRANGER.\r\n                               A.D. 1573.”\r\n\r\nBut upon the icy slab lay a woman’s glove still warm and fragrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE PROPHETS’ PARADISE\r\n\r\n    “If but the Vine and Love Abjuring Band\r\n     Are in the Prophets’ Paradise to stand,\r\n     Alack, I doubt the Prophets’ Paradise,\r\n     Were empty as the hollow of one’s hand.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE STUDIO\r\n\r\nHe smiled, saying, “Seek her throughout the world.”\r\n\r\nI said, “Why tell me of the world? My world is here, between these\r\nwalls and the sheet of glass above; here among gilded flagons and\r\ndull jewelled arms, tarnished frames and canvasses, black chests and\r\nhigh-backed chairs, quaintly carved and stained in blue and gold.”\r\n\r\n“For whom do you wait?” he said, and I answered, “When she comes I\r\nshall know her.”\r\n\r\nOn my hearth a tongue of flame whispered secrets to the whitening\r\nashes. In the street below I heard footsteps, a voice, and a song.\r\n\r\n“For whom then do you wait?” he said, and I answered, “I shall know\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nFootsteps, a voice, and a song in the street below, and I knew the song\r\nbut neither the steps nor the voice.\r\n\r\n“Fool!” he cried, “the song is the same, the voice and steps have but\r\nchanged with years!”\r\n\r\nOn the hearth a tongue of flame whispered above the whitening ashes:\r\n“Wait no more; they have passed, the steps and the voice in the street\r\nbelow.”\r\n\r\nThen he smiled, saying, “For whom do you wait? Seek her throughout the\r\nworld!”\r\n\r\nI answered, “My world is here, between these walls and the sheet\r\nof glass above; here among gilded flagons and dull jewelled arms,\r\ntarnished frames and canvasses, black chests and high-backed chairs,\r\nquaintly carved and stained in blue and gold.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PHANTOM\r\n\r\nThe Phantom of the Past would go no further.\r\n\r\n“If it is true,” she sighed, “that you find in me a friend, let us turn\r\nback together. You will forget, here, under the summer sky.”\r\n\r\nI held her close, pleading, caressing; I seized her, white with anger,\r\nbut she resisted.\r\n\r\n“If it is true,” she sighed, “that you find in me a friend, let us turn\r\nback together.”\r\n\r\nThe Phantom of the Past would go no further.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE SACRIFICE\r\n\r\nI went into a field of flowers, whose petals are whiter than snow and\r\nwhose hearts are pure gold.\r\n\r\nFar afield a woman cried, “I have killed him I loved!” and from a jar\r\nshe poured blood upon the flowers whose petals are whiter than snow and\r\nwhose hearts are pure gold.\r\n\r\nFar afield I followed, and on the jar I read a thousand names, while\r\nfrom within the fresh blood bubbled to the brim.\r\n\r\n“I have killed him I loved!” she cried. “The world’s athirst; now let\r\nit drink!” She passed, and far afield I watched her pouring blood upon\r\nthe flowers whose petals are whiter than snow and whose hearts are pure\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DESTINY\r\n\r\nI came to the bridge which few may pass.\r\n\r\n“Pass!” cried the keeper, but I laughed, saying, “There is time;” and\r\nhe smiled and shut the gates.\r\n\r\nTo the bridge which few may pass came young and old. All were refused.\r\nIdly I stood and counted them, until, wearied of their noise and\r\nlamentations, I came again to the bridge which few may pass.\r\n\r\nThose in the throng about the gates shrieked out, “He comes too late!”\r\nBut I laughed, saying, “There is time.”\r\n\r\n“Pass!” cried the keeper as I entered; then smiled and shut the gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE THRONG\r\n\r\nThere, where the throng was thickest in the street, I stood with\r\nPierrot. All eyes were turned on me.\r\n\r\n“What are they laughing at?” I asked, but he grinned, dusting the chalk\r\nfrom my black cloak. “I cannot see; it must be something droll, perhaps\r\nan honest thief!”\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned on me.\r\n\r\n“He has robbed you of your purse!” they laughed.\r\n\r\n“My purse!” I cried; “Pierrot—help! it is a thief!”\r\n\r\nThey laughed: “He has robbed you of your purse!”\r\n\r\nThen Truth stepped out, holding a mirror. “If he is an honest thief,”\r\ncried Truth, “Pierrot shall find him with this mirror!” but he only\r\ngrinned, dusting the chalk from my black cloak.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he said, “Truth is an honest thief, she brings you back your\r\nmirror.”\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned on me.\r\n\r\n“Arrest Truth!” I cried, forgetting it was not a mirror but a purse I\r\nlost, standing with Pierrot, there, where the throng was thickest in\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE JESTER\r\n\r\n“Was she fair?” I asked, but he only chuckled, listening to the bells\r\njingling on his cap.\r\n\r\n“Stabbed,” he tittered. “Think of the long journey, the days of peril,\r\nthe dreadful nights! Think how he wandered, for her sake, year after\r\nyear, through hostile lands, yearning for kith and kin, yearning for\r\nher!”\r\n\r\n“Stabbed,” he tittered, listening to the bells jingling on his cap.\r\n\r\n“Was she fair?” I asked, but he only snarled, muttering to the bells\r\njingling on his cap.\r\n\r\n“She kissed him at the gate,” he tittered, “but in the hall his\r\nbrother’s welcome touched his heart.”\r\n\r\n“Was she fair?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Stabbed,” he chuckled. “Think of the long journey, the days of peril,\r\nthe dreadful nights! Think how he wandered, for her sake, year after\r\nyear through hostile lands, yearning for kith and kin, yearning for\r\nher!”\r\n\r\n“She kissed him at the gate, but in the hall his brother’s welcome\r\ntouched his heart.”\r\n\r\n“Was she fair?” I asked; but he only snarled, listening to the bells\r\njingling in his cap.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE GREEN ROOM\r\n\r\nThe Clown turned his powdered face to the mirror.\r\n\r\n“If to be fair is to be beautiful,” he said, “who can compare with me\r\nin my white mask?”\r\n\r\n“Who can compare with him in his white mask?” I asked of Death beside\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Who can compare with me?” said Death, “for I am paler still.”\r\n\r\n“You are very beautiful,” sighed the Clown, turning his powdered face\r\nfrom the mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE LOVE TEST\r\n\r\n“If it is true that you love,” said Love, “then wait no longer. Give\r\nher these jewels which would dishonour her and so dishonour you in\r\nloving one dishonoured. If it is true that you love,” said Love, “then\r\nwait no longer.”\r\n\r\nI took the jewels and went to her, but she trod upon them, sobbing:\r\n“Teach me to wait—I love you!”\r\n\r\n“Then wait, if it is true,” said Love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE STREET OF THE FOUR WINDS\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Ferme tes yeux à demi,\r\n       Croise tes bras sur ton sein,\r\n       Et de ton cœur endormi\r\n       Chasse à jamais tout dessein.”\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n      “Je chante la nature,\r\n       Les étoiles du soir, les larmes du matin,\r\n       Les couchers de soleil à l’horizon lointain,\r\n       Le ciel qui parle au cœur d’existence future!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nThe animal paused on the threshold, interrogative, alert, ready for\r\nflight if necessary. Severn laid down his palette, and held out a hand\r\nof welcome. The cat remained motionless, her yellow eyes fastened upon\r\nSevern.\r\n\r\n“Puss,” he said, in his low, pleasant voice, “come in.”\r\n\r\nThe tip of her thin tail twitched uncertainly.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” he said again.\r\n\r\nApparently she found his voice reassuring, for she slowly settled upon\r\nall fours, her eyes still fastened upon him, her tail tucked under her\r\ngaunt flanks.\r\n\r\nHe rose from his easel smiling. She eyed him quietly, and when he\r\nwalked toward her she watched him bend above her without a wince; her\r\neyes followed his hand until it touched her head. Then she uttered a\r\nragged mew.\r\n\r\nIt had long been Severn’s custom to converse with animals, probably\r\nbecause he lived so much alone; and now he said, “What’s the matter,\r\npuss?”\r\n\r\nHer timid eyes sought his.\r\n\r\n“I understand,” he said gently, “you shall have it at once.”\r\n\r\nThen moving quietly about he busied himself with the duties of a host,\r\nrinsed a saucer, filled it with the rest of the milk from the bottle on\r\nthe window-sill, and kneeling down, crumbled a roll into the hollow of\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nThe creature rose and crept toward the saucer.\r\n\r\nWith the handle of a palette-knife he stirred the crumbs and milk\r\ntogether and stepped back as she thrust her nose into the mess. He\r\nwatched her in silence. From time to time the saucer clinked upon the\r\ntiled floor as she reached for a morsel on the rim; and at last the\r\nbread was all gone, and her purple tongue travelled over every unlicked\r\nspot until the saucer shone like polished marble. Then she sat up, and\r\ncoolly turning her back to him, began her ablutions.\r\n\r\n“Keep it up,” said Severn, much interested, “you need it.”\r\n\r\nShe flattened one ear, but neither turned nor interrupted her toilet.\r\nAs the grime was slowly removed Severn observed that nature had\r\nintended her for a white cat. Her fur had disappeared in patches,\r\nfrom disease or the chances of war, her tail was bony and her spine\r\nsharp. But what charms she had were becoming apparent under vigorous\r\nlicking, and he waited until she had finished before re-opening the\r\nconversation. When at last she closed her eyes and folded her forepaws\r\nunder her breast, he began again very gently: “Puss, tell me your\r\ntroubles.”\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his voice she broke into a harsh rumbling which he\r\nrecognized as an attempt to purr. He bent over to rub her cheek and\r\nshe mewed again, an amiable inquiring little mew, to which he replied,\r\n“Certainly, you are greatly improved, and when you recover your plumage\r\nyou will be a gorgeous bird.” Much flattered, she stood up and marched\r\naround and around his legs, pushing her head between them and making\r\npleased remarks, to which he responded with grave politeness.\r\n\r\n“Now, what sent you here,” he said—“here into the Street of the Four\r\nWinds, and up five flights to the very door where you would be welcome?\r\nWhat was it that prevented your meditated flight when I turned from my\r\ncanvas to encounter your yellow eyes? Are you a Latin Quarter cat as I\r\nam a Latin Quarter man? And why do you wear a rose-coloured flowered\r\ngarter buckled about your neck?” The cat had climbed into his lap, and\r\nnow sat purring as he passed his hand over her thin coat.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” he continued in lazy soothing tones, harmonizing with\r\nher purring, “if I seem indelicate, but I cannot help musing on this\r\nrose-coloured garter, flowered so quaintly and fastened with a silver\r\nclasp. For the clasp is silver; I can see the mint mark on the edge,\r\nas is prescribed by the law of the French Republic. Now, why is this\r\ngarter woven of rose silk and delicately embroidered,—why is this\r\nsilken garter with its silver clasp about your famished throat? Am\r\nI indiscreet when I inquire if its owner is your owner? Is she some\r\naged dame living in memory of youthful vanities, fond, doting on you,\r\ndecorating you with her intimate personal attire? The circumference of\r\nthe garter would suggest this, for your neck is thin, and the garter\r\nfits you. But then again I notice—I notice most things—that the\r\ngarter is capable of being much enlarged. These small silver-rimmed\r\neyelets, of which I count five, are proof of that. And now I observe\r\nthat the fifth eyelet is worn out, as though the tongue of the clasp\r\nwere accustomed to lie there. That seems to argue a well-rounded form.”\r\n\r\nThe cat curled her toes in contentment. The street was very still\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nHe murmured on: “Why should your mistress decorate you with an article\r\nmost necessary to her at all times? Anyway, at most times. How did\r\nshe come to slip this bit of silk and silver about your neck? Was it\r\nthe caprice of a moment,—when you, before you had lost your pristine\r\nplumpness, marched singing into her bedroom to bid her good-morning? Of\r\ncourse, and she sat up among the pillows, her coiled hair tumbling to\r\nher shoulders, as you sprang upon the bed purring: ‘Good-day, my lady.’\r\nOh, it is very easy to understand,” he yawned, resting his head on the\r\nback of the chair. The cat still purred, tightening and relaxing her\r\npadded claws over his knee.\r\n\r\n“Shall I tell you all about her, cat? She is very beautiful—your\r\nmistress,” he murmured drowsily, “and her hair is heavy as burnished\r\ngold. I could paint her,—not on canvas—for I should need shades and\r\ntones and hues and dyes more splendid than the iris of a splendid\r\nrainbow. I could only paint her with closed eyes, for in dreams alone\r\ncan such colours as I need be found. For her eyes, I must have azure\r\nfrom skies untroubled by a cloud—the skies of dreamland. For her lips,\r\nroses from the palaces of slumberland, and for her brow, snow-drifts\r\nfrom mountains which tower in fantastic pinnacles to the moons;—oh,\r\nmuch higher than our moon here,—the crystal moons of dreamland. She\r\nis—very—beautiful, your mistress.”\r\n\r\nThe words died on his lips and his eyelids drooped.\r\n\r\nThe cat, too, was asleep, her cheek turned up upon her wasted flank,\r\nher paws relaxed and limp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n“It is fortunate,” said Severn, sitting up and stretching, “that we\r\nhave tided over the dinner hour, for I have nothing to offer you for\r\nsupper but what may be purchased with one silver franc.”\r\n\r\nThe cat on his knee rose, arched her back, yawned, and looked up at him.\r\n\r\n“What shall it be? A roast chicken with salad? No? Possibly you prefer\r\nbeef? Of course,—and I shall try an egg and some white bread. Now for\r\nthe wines. Milk for you? Good. I shall take a little water, fresh from\r\nthe wood,” with a motion toward the bucket in the sink.\r\n\r\nHe put on his hat and left the room. The cat followed to the door, and\r\nafter he had closed it behind him, she settled down, smelling at the\r\ncracks, and cocking one ear at every creak from the crazy old building.\r\n\r\nThe door below opened and shut. The cat looked serious, for a moment\r\ndoubtful, and her ears flattened in nervous expectation. Presently she\r\nrose with a jerk of her tail and started on a noiseless tour of the\r\nstudio. She sneezed at a pot of turpentine, hastily retreating to the\r\ntable, which she presently mounted, and having satisfied her curiosity\r\nconcerning a roll of red modelling wax, returned to the door and sat\r\ndown with her eyes on the crack over the threshold. Then she lifted her\r\nvoice in a thin plaint.\r\n\r\nWhen Severn returned he looked grave, but the cat, joyous and\r\ndemonstrative, marched around him, rubbing her gaunt body against his\r\nlegs, driving her head enthusiastically into his hand, and purring\r\nuntil her voice mounted to a squeal.\r\n\r\nHe placed a bit of meat, wrapped in brown paper, upon the table, and\r\nwith a penknife cut it into shreds. The milk he took from a bottle\r\nwhich had served for medicine, and poured it into the saucer on the\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\nThe cat crouched before it, purring and lapping at the same time.\r\n\r\nHe cooked his egg and ate it with a slice of bread, watching her busy\r\nwith the shredded meat, and when he had finished, and had filled and\r\nemptied a cup of water from the bucket in the sink, he sat down, taking\r\nher into his lap, where she at once curled up and began her toilet.\r\nHe began to speak again, touching her caressingly at times by way of\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\n“Cat, I have found out where your mistress lives. It is not very far\r\naway;—it is here, under this same leaky roof, but in the north wing\r\nwhich I had supposed was uninhabited. My janitor tells me this. By\r\nchance, he is almost sober this evening. The butcher on the rue de\r\nSeine, where I bought your meat, knows you, and old Cabane the baker\r\nidentified you with needless sarcasm. They tell me hard tales of your\r\nmistress which I shall not believe. They say she is idle and vain and\r\npleasure-loving; they say she is harebrained and reckless. The little\r\nsculptor on the ground floor, who was buying rolls from old Cabane,\r\nspoke to me to-night for the first time, although we have always bowed\r\nto each other. He said she was very good and very beautiful. He has\r\nonly seen her once, and does not know her name. I thanked him;—I don’t\r\nknow why I thanked him so warmly. Cabane said, ‘Into this cursed Street\r\nof the Four Winds, the four winds blow all things evil.’ The sculptor\r\nlooked confused, but when he went out with his rolls, he said to me, ‘I\r\nam sure, Monsieur, that she is as good as she is beautiful.’”\r\n\r\nThe cat had finished her toilet, and now, springing softly to the\r\nfloor, went to the door and sniffed. He knelt beside her, and\r\nunclasping the garter held it for a moment in his hands. After a while\r\nhe said: “There is a name engraved upon the silver clasp beneath the\r\nbuckle. It is a pretty name, Sylvia Elven. Sylvia is a woman’s name,\r\nElven is the name of a town. In Paris, in this quarter, above all,\r\nin this Street of the Four Winds, names are worn and put away as the\r\nfashions change with the seasons. I know the little town of Elven, for\r\nthere I met Fate face to face and Fate was unkind. But do you know that\r\nin Elven Fate had another name, and that name was Sylvia?”\r\n\r\nHe replaced the garter and stood up looking down at the cat crouched\r\nbefore the closed door.\r\n\r\n“The name of Elven has a charm for me. It tells me of meadows and clear\r\nrivers. The name of Sylvia troubles me like perfume from dead flowers.”\r\n\r\nThe cat mewed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” he said soothingly, “I will take you back. Your Sylvia is\r\nnot my Sylvia; the world is wide and Elven is not unknown. Yet in the\r\ndarkness and filth of poorer Paris, in the sad shadows of this ancient\r\nhouse, these names are very pleasant to me.”\r\n\r\nHe lifted her in his arms and strode through the silent corridors to\r\nthe stairs. Down five flights and into the moonlit court, past the\r\nlittle sculptor’s den, and then again in at the gate of the north wing\r\nand up the worm-eaten stairs he passed, until he came to a closed door.\r\nWhen he had stood knocking for a long time, something moved behind the\r\ndoor; it opened and he went in. The room was dark. As he crossed the\r\nthreshold, the cat sprang from his arms into the shadows. He listened\r\nbut heard nothing. The silence was oppressive and he struck a match.\r\nAt his elbow stood a table and on the table a candle in a gilded\r\ncandlestick. This he lighted, then looked around. The chamber was vast,\r\nthe hangings heavy with embroidery. Over the fireplace towered a carved\r\nmantel, grey with the ashes of dead fires. In a recess by the deep-set\r\nwindows stood a bed, from which the bedclothes, soft and fine as lace,\r\ntrailed to the polished floor. He lifted the candle above his head. A\r\nhandkerchief lay at his feet. It was faintly perfumed. He turned toward\r\nthe windows. In front of them was a _canapé_ and over it were flung,\r\npell-mell, a gown of silk, a heap of lace-like garments, white and\r\ndelicate as spiders’ meshes, long, crumpled gloves, and, on the floor\r\nbeneath, the stockings, the little pointed shoes, and one garter of\r\nrosy silk, quaintly flowered and fitted with a silver clasp. Wondering,\r\nhe stepped forward and drew the heavy curtains from the bed. For a\r\nmoment the candle flared in his hand; then his eyes met two other eyes,\r\nwide open, smiling, and the candle-flame flashed over hair heavy as\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nShe was pale, but not as white as he; her eyes were untroubled as a\r\nchild’s; but he stared, trembling from head to foot, while the candle\r\nflickered in his hand.\r\n\r\nAt last he whispered: “Sylvia, it is I.”\r\n\r\nAgain he said, “It is I.”\r\n\r\nThen, knowing that she was dead, he kissed her on the mouth. And\r\nthrough the long watches of the night the cat purred on his knee,\r\ntightening and relaxing her padded claws, until the sky paled above the\r\nStreet of the Four Winds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE STREET OF THE FIRST SHELL\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Be of Good Cheer, the Sullen Month will die,\r\n     And a young Moon requite us by and by:\r\n     Look how the Old one, meagre, bent, and wan\r\n     With age and Fast, is fainting from the sky.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\nThe room was already dark. The high roofs opposite cut off what little\r\nremained of the December daylight. The girl drew her chair nearer the\r\nwindow, and choosing a large needle, threaded it, knotting the thread\r\nover her fingers. Then she smoothed the baby garment across her knees,\r\nand bending, bit off the thread and drew the smaller needle from where\r\nit rested in the hem. When she had brushed away the stray threads and\r\nbits of lace, she laid it again over her knees caressingly. Then she\r\nslipped the threaded needle from her corsage and passed it through a\r\nbutton, but as the button spun down the thread, her hand faltered, the\r\nthread snapped, and the button rolled across the floor. She raised\r\nher head. Her eyes were fixed on a strip of waning light above the\r\nchimneys. From somewhere in the city came sounds like the distant\r\nbeating of drums, and beyond, far beyond, a vague muttering, now\r\ngrowing, swelling, rumbling in the distance like the pounding of surf\r\nupon the rocks, now like the surf again, receding, growling, menacing.\r\nThe cold had become intense, a bitter piercing cold which strained and\r\nsnapped at joist and beam and turned the slush of yesterday to flint.\r\nFrom the street below every sound broke sharp and metallic—the clatter\r\nof sabots, the rattle of shutters or the rare sound of a human voice.\r\nThe air was heavy, weighted with the black cold as with a pall. To\r\nbreathe was painful, to move an effort.\r\n\r\nIn the desolate sky there was something that wearied, in the brooding\r\nclouds, something that saddened. It penetrated the freezing city cut\r\nby the freezing river, the splendid city with its towers and domes,\r\nits quays and bridges and its thousand spires. It entered the squares,\r\nit seized the avenues and the palaces, stole across bridges and crept\r\namong the narrow streets of the Latin Quarter, grey under the grey of\r\nthe December sky. Sadness, utter sadness. A fine icy sleet was falling,\r\npowdering the pavement with a tiny crystalline dust. It sifted against\r\nthe window-panes and drifted in heaps along the sill. The light at\r\nthe window had nearly failed, and the girl bent low over her work.\r\nPresently she raised her head, brushing the curls from her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Jack?”\r\n\r\n“Dearest?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t forget to clean your palette.”\r\n\r\nHe said, “All right,” and picking up the palette, sat down upon the\r\nfloor in front of the stove. His head and shoulders were in the shadow,\r\nbut the firelight fell across his knees and glimmered red on the\r\nblade of the palette-knife. Full in the firelight beside him stood a\r\ncolour-box. On the lid was carved,\r\n\r\n                       +-------------------------+\r\n                       |        J. TRENT.        |\r\n                       |  École des Beaux Arts.  |\r\n                       |          1870.          |\r\n                       +-------------------------+\r\n\r\nThis inscription was ornamented with an American and a French flag.\r\n\r\nThe sleet blew against the window-panes, covering them with stars and\r\ndiamonds, then, melting from the warmer air within, ran down and froze\r\nagain in fern-like traceries.\r\n\r\nA dog whined and the patter of small paws sounded on the zinc behind\r\nthe stove.\r\n\r\n“Jack, dear, do you think Hercules is hungry?”\r\n\r\nThe patter of paws was redoubled behind the stove.\r\n\r\n“He’s whining,” she continued nervously, “and if it isn’t because he’s\r\nhungry it is because—”\r\n\r\nHer voice faltered. A loud humming filled the air, the windows vibrated.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Jack,” she cried, “another—” but her voice was drowned in the\r\nscream of a shell tearing through the clouds overhead.\r\n\r\n“That is the nearest yet,” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” he answered cheerfully, “it probably fell way over by\r\nMontmartre,” and as she did not answer, he said again with exaggerated\r\nunconcern, “They wouldn’t take the trouble to fire at the Latin\r\nQuarter; anyway they haven’t a battery that can hurt it.”\r\n\r\nAfter a while she spoke up brightly: “Jack, dear, when are you going to\r\ntake me to see Monsieur West’s statues?”\r\n\r\n“I will bet,” he said, throwing down his palette and walking over to\r\nthe window beside her, “that Colette has been here to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” she asked, opening her eyes very wide. Then, “Oh, it’s too\r\nbad!—really, men are tiresome when they think they know everything!\r\nAnd I warn you that if Monsieur West is vain enough to imagine that\r\nColette—”\r\n\r\nFrom the north another shell came whistling and quavering through the\r\nsky, passing above them with long-drawn screech which left the windows\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n“That,” he blurted out, “was too near for comfort.”\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a while, then he spoke again gaily: “Go on,\r\nSylvia, and wither poor West;” but she only sighed, “Oh, dear, I can\r\nnever seem to get used to the shells.”\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the arm of the chair beside her.\r\n\r\nHer scissors fell jingling to the floor; she tossed the unfinished\r\nfrock after them, and putting both arms about his neck drew him down\r\ninto her lap.\r\n\r\n“Don’t go out to-night, Jack.”\r\n\r\nHe kissed her uplifted face; “You know I must; don’t make it hard for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“But when I hear the shells and—and know you are out in the city—”\r\n\r\n“But they all fall in Montmartre—”\r\n\r\n“They may all fall in the Beaux Arts; you said yourself that two struck\r\nthe Quai d’Orsay—”\r\n\r\n“Mere accident—”\r\n\r\n“Jack, have pity on me! Take me with you!”\r\n\r\n“And who will there be to get dinner?”\r\n\r\nShe rose and flung herself on the bed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I can’t get used to it, and I know you must go, but I beg you not\r\nto be late to dinner. If you knew what I suffer! I—I—cannot help it,\r\nand you must be patient with me, dear.”\r\n\r\nHe said, “It is as safe there as it is in our own house.”\r\n\r\nShe watched him fill for her the alcohol lamp, and when he had lighted\r\nit and had taken his hat to go, she jumped up and clung to him in\r\nsilence. After a moment he said: “Now, Sylvia, remember my courage\r\nis sustained by yours. Come, I must go!” She did not move, and he\r\nrepeated: “I must go.” Then she stepped back and he thought she was\r\ngoing to speak and waited, but she only looked at him, and, a little\r\nimpatiently, he kissed her again, saying: “Don’t worry, dearest.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had reached the last flight of stairs on his way to the street\r\na woman hobbled out of the house-keeper’s lodge waving a letter and\r\ncalling: “Monsieur Jack! Monsieur Jack! this was left by Monsieur\r\nFallowby!”\r\n\r\nHe took the letter, and leaning on the threshold of the lodge, read it:\r\n\r\n  “Dear Jack,\r\n\r\n  “I believe Braith is dead broke and I’m sure Fallowby is. Braith\r\n  swears he isn’t, and Fallowby swears he is, so you can draw your\r\n  own conclusions. I’ve got a scheme for a dinner, and if it works, I\r\n  will let you fellows in.\r\n\r\n                                            “Yours faithfully,\r\n                                                              “West.\r\n\r\n  “P.S.—Fallowby has shaken Hartman and his gang, thank the Lord!\r\n  There is something rotten there,—or it may be he’s only a miser.\r\n\r\n  “P.P.S.—I’m more desperately in love than ever, but I’m sure she\r\n  does not care a straw for me.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Trent, with a smile, to the concierge; “but tell me,\r\nhow is Papa Cottard?”\r\n\r\nThe old woman shook her head and pointed to the curtained bed in the\r\nlodge.\r\n\r\n“Père Cottard!” he cried cheerily, “how goes the wound to-day?”\r\n\r\nHe walked over to the bed and drew the curtains. An old man was lying\r\namong the tumbled sheets.\r\n\r\n“Better?” smiled Trent.\r\n\r\n“Better,” repeated the man wearily; and, after a pause, “Have you any\r\nnews, Monsieur Jack?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t been out to-day. I will bring you any rumour I may hear,\r\nthough goodness knows I’ve got enough of rumours,” he muttered to\r\nhimself. Then aloud: “Cheer up; you’re looking better.”\r\n\r\n“And the sortie?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the sortie, that’s for this week. General Trochu sent orders last\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“It will be terrible.”\r\n\r\n“It will be sickening,” thought Trent as he went not into the street\r\nand turned the corner toward the rue de Seine; “slaughter, slaughter,\r\nphew! I’m glad I’m not going.”\r\n\r\nThe street was almost deserted. A few women muffled in tattered\r\nmilitary capes crept along the frozen pavement, and a wretchedly clad\r\ngamin hovered over the sewer-hole on the corner of the Boulevard. A\r\nrope around his waist held his rags together. From the rope hung a rat,\r\nstill warm and bleeding.\r\n\r\n“There’s another in there,” he yelled at Trent; “I hit him but he got\r\naway.”\r\n\r\nTrent crossed the street and asked: “How much?”\r\n\r\n“Two francs for a quarter of a fat one; that’s what they give at the\r\nSt. Germain Market.”\r\n\r\nA violent fit of coughing interrupted him, but he wiped his face with\r\nthe palm of his hand and looked cunningly at Trent.\r\n\r\n“Last week you could buy a rat for six francs, but,” and here he swore\r\nvilely, “the rats have quit the rue de Seine and they kill them now\r\nover by the new hospital. I’ll let you have this for seven francs; I\r\ncan sell it for ten in the Isle St. Louis.”\r\n\r\n“You lie,” said Trent, “and let me tell you that if you try to swindle\r\nanybody in this quarter the people will make short work of you and your\r\nrats.”\r\n\r\nHe stood a moment eyeing the gamin, who pretended to snivel. Then\r\nhe tossed him a franc, laughing. The child caught it, and thrusting\r\nit into his mouth wheeled about to the sewer-hole. For a second he\r\ncrouched, motionless, alert, his eyes on the bars of the drain, then\r\nleaping forward he hurled a stone into the gutter, and Trent left him\r\nto finish a fierce grey rat that writhed squealing at the mouth of the\r\nsewer.\r\n\r\n“Suppose Braith should come to that,” he thought; “poor little chap;”\r\nand hurrying, he turned in the dirty passage des Beaux Arts and entered\r\nthe third house to the left.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur is at home,” quavered the old concierge.\r\n\r\nHome? A garret absolutely bare, save for the iron bedstead in the\r\ncorner and the iron basin and pitcher on the floor.\r\n\r\nWest appeared at the door, winking with much mystery, and motioned\r\nTrent to enter. Braith, who was painting in bed to keep warm, looked\r\nup, laughed, and shook hands.\r\n\r\n“Any news?”\r\n\r\nThe perfunctory question was answered as usual by: “Nothing but the\r\ncannon.”\r\n\r\nTrent sat down on the bed.\r\n\r\n“Where on earth did you get that?” he demanded, pointing to a\r\nhalf-finished chicken nestling in a wash-basin.\r\n\r\nWest grinned.\r\n\r\n“Are you millionaires, you two? Out with it.”\r\n\r\nBraith, looking a little ashamed, began, “Oh, it’s one of West’s\r\nexploits,” but was cut short by West, who said he would tell the story\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“You see, before the siege, I had a letter of introduction to a\r\n‘_type_’ here, a fat banker, German-American variety. You know the\r\nspecies, I see. Well, of course I forgot to present the letter, but\r\nthis morning, judging it to be a favourable opportunity, I called on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“The villain lives in comfort;—fires, my boy!—fires in the\r\nante-rooms! The Buttons finally condescends to carry my letter and\r\ncard up, leaving me standing in the hallway, which I did not like,\r\nso I entered the first room I saw and nearly fainted at the sight of\r\na banquet on a table by the fire. Down comes Buttons, very insolent.\r\nNo, oh, no, his master, ‘is not at home, and in fact is too busy to\r\nreceive letters of introduction just now; the siege, and many business\r\ndifficulties—’\r\n\r\n“I deliver a kick to Buttons, pick up this chicken from the table, toss\r\nmy card on to the empty plate, and addressing Buttons as a species of\r\nPrussian pig, march out with the honours of war.”\r\n\r\nTrent shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I forgot to say that Hartman often dines there, and I draw my own\r\nconclusions,” continued West. “Now about this chicken, half of it is\r\nfor Braith and myself, and half for Colette, but of course you will\r\nhelp me eat my part because I’m not hungry.”\r\n\r\n“Neither am I,” began Braith, but Trent, with a smile at the pinched\r\nfaces before him, shook his head saying, “What nonsense! You know I’m\r\nnever hungry!”\r\n\r\nWest hesitated, reddened, and then slicing off Braith’s portion, but\r\nnot eating any himself, said good-night, and hurried away to number 470\r\nrue Serpente, where lived a pretty girl named Colette, orphan after\r\nSedan, and Heaven alone knew where she got the roses in her cheeks, for\r\nthe siege came hard on the poor.\r\n\r\n“That chicken will delight her, but I really believe she’s in love with\r\nWest,” said Trent. Then walking over to the bed: “See here, old man, no\r\ndodging, you know, how much have you left?”\r\n\r\nThe other hesitated and flushed.\r\n\r\n“Come, old chap,” insisted Trent.\r\n\r\nBraith drew a purse from beneath his bolster, and handed it to his\r\nfriend with a simplicity that touched him.\r\n\r\n“Seven sons,” he counted; “you make me tired! Why on earth don’t you\r\ncome to me? I take it d——d ill, Braith! How many times must I go\r\nover the same thing and explain to you that because I have money it is\r\nmy duty to share it, and your duty and the duty of every American to\r\nshare it with me? You can’t get a cent, the city’s blockaded, and the\r\nAmerican Minister has his hands full with all the German riff-raff and\r\ndeuce knows what! Why don’t you act sensibly?”\r\n\r\n“I—I will, Trent, but it’s an obligation that perhaps I can never even\r\nin part repay, I’m poor and—”\r\n\r\n“Of course you’ll pay me! If I were a usurer I would take your talent\r\nfor security. When you are rich and famous—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t, Trent—”\r\n\r\n“All right, only no more monkey business.”\r\n\r\nHe slipped a dozen gold pieces into the purse, and tucking it again\r\nunder the mattress smiled at Braith.\r\n\r\n“How old are you?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Sixteen.”\r\n\r\nTrent laid his hand lightly on his friend’s shoulder. “I’m twenty-two,\r\nand I have the rights of a grandfather as far as you are concerned.\r\nYou’ll do as I say until you’re twenty-one.”\r\n\r\n“The siège will be over then, I hope,” said Braith, trying to laugh,\r\nbut the prayer in their hearts: “How long, O Lord, how long!” was\r\nanswered by the swift scream of a shell soaring among the storm-clouds\r\nof that December night.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nWest, standing in the doorway of a house in the rue Serpentine, was\r\nspeaking angrily. He said he didn’t care whether Hartman liked it or\r\nnot; he was telling him, not arguing with him.\r\n\r\n“You call yourself an American!” he sneered; “Berlin and hell are\r\nfull of that kind of American. You come loafing about Colette with\r\nyour pockets stuffed with white bread and beef, and a bottle of wine\r\nat thirty francs and you can’t really afford to give a dollar to the\r\nAmerican Ambulance and Public Assistance, which Braith does, and he’s\r\nhalf starved!”\r\n\r\nHartman retreated to the curbstone, but West followed him, his face\r\nlike a thunder-cloud. “Don’t you dare to call yourself a countryman\r\nof mine,” he growled,—“no,—nor an artist either! Artists don’t worm\r\nthemselves into the service of the Public Defence where they do nothing\r\nbut feed like rats on the people’s food! And I’ll tell you now,” he\r\ncontinued dropping his voice, for Hartman had started as though stung,\r\n“you might better keep away from that Alsatian Brasserie and the\r\nsmug-faced thieves who haunt it. You know what they do with suspects!”\r\n\r\n“You lie, you hound!” screamed Hartman, and flung the bottle in his\r\nhand straight at West’s face. West had him by the throat in a second,\r\nand forcing him against the dead wall shook him wickedly.\r\n\r\n“Now you listen to me,” he muttered, through his clenched teeth. “You\r\nare already a suspect and—I swear—I believe you are a paid spy! It\r\nisn’t my business to detect such vermin, and I don’t intend to denounce\r\nyou, but understand this! Colette don’t like you and I can’t stand\r\nyou, and if I catch you in this street again I’ll make it somewhat\r\nunpleasant. Get out, you sleek Prussian!”\r\n\r\nHartman had managed to drag a knife from his pocket, but West tore it\r\nfrom him and hurled him into the gutter. A gamin who had seen this\r\nburst into a peal of laughter, which rattled harshly in the silent\r\nstreet. Then everywhere windows were raised and rows of haggard faces\r\nappeared demanding to know why people should laugh in the starving city.\r\n\r\n“Is it a victory?” murmured one.\r\n\r\n“Look at that,” cried West as Hartman picked himself up from the\r\npavement, “look! you miser! look at those faces!” But Hartman gave\r\n_him_ a look which he never forgot, and walked away without a word.\r\nTrent, who suddenly appeared at the corner, glanced curiously at\r\nWest, who merely nodded toward his door saying, “Come in; Fallowby’s\r\nupstairs.”\r\n\r\n“What are you doing with that knife?” demanded Fallowby, as he and\r\nTrent entered the studio.\r\n\r\nWest looked at his wounded hand, which still clutched the knife, but\r\nsaying, “Cut myself by accident,” tossed it into a corner and washed\r\nthe blood from his fingers.\r\n\r\nFallowby, fat and lazy, watched him without comment, but Trent, half\r\ndivining how things had turned, walked over to Fallowby smiling.\r\n\r\n“I’ve a bone to pick with you!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Where is it? I’m hungry,” replied Fallowby with affected eagerness,\r\nbut Trent, frowning, told him to listen.\r\n\r\n“How much did I advance you a week ago?”\r\n\r\n“Three hundred and eighty francs,” replied the other, with a squirm of\r\ncontrition.\r\n\r\n“Where is it?”\r\n\r\nFallowby began a series of intricate explanations, which were soon cut\r\nshort by Trent.\r\n\r\n“I know; you blew it in;—you always blow it in. I don’t care a rap\r\nwhat you did before the siege: I know you are rich and have a right to\r\ndispose of your money as you wish to, and I also know that, generally\r\nspeaking, it is none of my business. But _now_ it is my business, as I\r\nhave to supply the funds until you get some more, which you won’t until\r\nthe siege is ended one way or another. I wish to share what I have, but\r\nI won’t see it thrown out of the window. Oh, yes, of course I know you\r\nwill reimburse me, but that isn’t the question; and, anyway, it’s the\r\nopinion of your friends, old man, that you will not be worse off for a\r\nlittle abstinence from fleshly pleasures. You are positively a freak in\r\nthis famine-cursed city of skeletons!”\r\n\r\n“I _am_ rather stout,” he admitted.\r\n\r\n“Is it true you are out of money?” demanded Trent.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am,” sighed the other.\r\n\r\n“That roast sucking pig on the rue St. Honoré,—is it there yet?”\r\ncontinued Trent.\r\n\r\n“Wh—at?” stammered the feeble one.\r\n\r\n“Ah—I thought so! I caught you in ecstasy before that sucking pig at\r\nleast a dozen times!”\r\n\r\nThen laughing, he presented Fallowby with a roll of twenty franc pieces\r\nsaying: “If these go for luxuries you must live on your own flesh,” and\r\nwent over to aid West, who sat beside the wash-basin binding up his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nWest suffered him to tie the knot, and then said: “You remember,\r\nyesterday, when I left you and Braith to take the chicken to Colette.”\r\n\r\n“Chicken! Good heavens!” moaned Fallowby.\r\n\r\n“Chicken,” repeated West, enjoying Fallowby’s grief;—“I—that is,\r\nI must explain that things are changed. Colette and I—are to be\r\nmarried—”\r\n\r\n“What—what about the chicken?” groaned Fallowby.\r\n\r\n“Shut up!” laughed Trent, and slipping his arm through West’s, walked\r\nto the stairway.\r\n\r\n“The poor little thing,” said West, “just think, not a splinter of\r\nfirewood for a week and wouldn’t tell me because she thought I needed\r\nit for my clay figure. Whew! When I heard it I smashed that smirking\r\nclay nymph to pieces, and the rest can freeze and be hanged!” After a\r\nmoment he added timidly: “Won’t you call on your way down and say _bon\r\nsoir_? It’s No. 17.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Trent, and he went out softly closing the door behind.\r\n\r\nHe stopped on the third landing, lighted a match, scanned the numbers\r\nover the row of dingy doors, and knocked at No. 17.\r\n\r\n“C’est toi Georges?” The door opened.\r\n\r\n“Oh, pardon, Monsieur Jack, I thought it was Monsieur West,” then\r\nblushing furiously, “Oh, I see you have heard! Oh, thank you so much\r\nfor your wishes, and I’m sure we love each other very much,—and I’m\r\ndying to see Sylvia and tell her and—”\r\n\r\n“And what?” laughed Trent.\r\n\r\n“I am very happy,” she sighed.\r\n\r\n“He’s pure gold,” returned Trent, and then gaily: “I want you and\r\nGeorge to come and dine with us to-night. It’s a little treat,—you see\r\nto-morrow is Sylvia’s _fête_. She will be nineteen. I have written to\r\nThorne, and the Guernalecs will come with their cousin Odile. Fallowby\r\nhas engaged not to bring anybody but himself.”\r\n\r\nThe girl accepted shyly, charging him with loads of loving messages to\r\nSylvia, and he said good-night.\r\n\r\nHe started up the street, walking swiftly, for it was bitter cold, and\r\ncutting across the rue de la Lune he entered the rue de Seine. The\r\nearly winter night had fallen, almost without warning, but the sky was\r\nclear and myriads of stars glittered in the heavens. The bombardment\r\nhad become furious—a steady rolling thunder from the Prussian cannon\r\npunctuated by the heavy shocks from Mont Valérien.\r\n\r\nThe shells streamed across the sky leaving trails like shooting stars,\r\nand now, as he turned to look back, rockets blue and red flared above\r\nthe horizon from the Fort of Issy, and the Fortress of the North flamed\r\nlike a bonfire.\r\n\r\n“Good news!” a man shouted over by the Boulevard St. Germain. As if\r\nby magic the streets were filled with people,—shivering, chattering\r\npeople with shrunken eyes.\r\n\r\n“Jacques!” cried one. “The Army of the Loire!”\r\n\r\n“Eh! _mon vieux_, it has come then at last! I told thee! I told thee!\r\nTo-morrow—to-night—who knows?”\r\n\r\n“Is it true? Is it a sortie?”\r\n\r\nSome one said: “Oh, God—a sortie—and my son?” Another cried: “To the\r\nSeine? They say one can see the signals of the Army of the Loire from\r\nthe Pont Neuf.”\r\n\r\nThere was a child standing near Trent who kept repeating: “Mamma,\r\nMamma, then to-morrow we may eat white bread?” and beside him, an old\r\nman swaying, stumbling, his shrivelled hands crushed to his breast,\r\nmuttering as if insane.\r\n\r\n“Could it be true? Who has heard the news? The shoemaker on the rue de\r\nBuci had it from a Mobile who had heard a Franctireur repeat it to a\r\ncaptain of the National Guard.”\r\n\r\nTrent followed the throng surging through the rue de Seine to the river.\r\n\r\nRocket after rocket clove the sky, and now, from Montmartre, the cannon\r\nclanged, and the batteries on Montparnasse joined in with a crash. The\r\nbridge was packed with people.\r\n\r\nTrent asked: “Who has seen the signals of the Army of the Loire?”\r\n\r\n“We are waiting for them,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nHe looked toward the north. Suddenly the huge silhouette of the Arc de\r\nTriomphe sprang into black relief against the flash of a cannon. The\r\nboom of the gun rolled along the quay and the old bridge vibrated.\r\n\r\nAgain over by the Point du Jour a flash and heavy explosion shook the\r\nbridge, and then the whole eastern bastion of the fortifications blazed\r\nand crackled, sending a red flame into the sky.\r\n\r\n“Has any one seen the signals yet?” he asked again.\r\n\r\n“We are waiting,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Yes, waiting,” murmured a man behind him, “waiting, sick, starved,\r\nfreezing, but waiting. Is it a sortie? They go gladly. Is it to\r\nstarve? They starve. They have no time to think of surrender. Are they\r\nheroes,—these Parisians? Answer me, Trent!”\r\n\r\nThe American Ambulance surgeon turned about and scanned the parapets of\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\n“Any news, Doctor,” asked Trent mechanically.\r\n\r\n“News?” said the doctor; “I don’t know any;—I haven’t time to know\r\nany. What are these people after?”\r\n\r\n“They say that the Army of the Loire has signalled Mont Valérien.”\r\n\r\n“Poor devils.” The doctor glanced about him for an instant, and then:\r\n“I’m so harried and worried that I don’t know what to do. After the\r\nlast sortie we had the work of fifty ambulances on our poor little\r\ncorps. To-morrow there’s another sortie, and I wish you fellows could\r\ncome over to headquarters. We may need volunteers. How is madame?” he\r\nadded abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Trent, “but she seems to grow more nervous every day. I\r\nought to be with her now.”\r\n\r\n“Take care of her,” said the doctor, then with a sharp look at the\r\npeople: “I can’t stop now—good-night!” and he hurried away muttering,\r\n“Poor devils!”\r\n\r\nTrent leaned over the parapet and blinked at the black river surging\r\nthrough the arches. Dark objects, carried swiftly on the breast of the\r\ncurrent, struck with a grinding tearing noise against the stone piers,\r\nspun around for an instant, and hurried away into the darkness. The ice\r\nfrom the Marne.\r\n\r\nAs he stood staring into the water, a hand was laid on his shoulder.\r\n“Hello, Southwark!” he cried, turning around; “this is a queer place\r\nfor you!”\r\n\r\n“Trent, I have something to tell you. Don’t stay here,—don’t believe\r\nin the Army of the Loire:” and the _attaché_ of the American Legation\r\nslipped his arm through Trent’s and drew him toward the Louvre.\r\n\r\n“Then it’s another lie!” said Trent bitterly.\r\n\r\n“Worse—we know at the Legation—I can’t speak of it. But that’s not\r\nwhat I have to say. Something happened this afternoon. The Alsatian\r\nBrasserie was visited and an American named Hartman has been arrested.\r\nDo you know him?”\r\n\r\n“I know a German who calls himself an American;—his name is Hartman.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he was arrested about two hours ago. They mean to shoot him.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Of course we at the Legation can’t allow them to shoot him off-hand,\r\nbut the evidence seems conclusive.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a spy?”\r\n\r\n“Well, the papers seized in his rooms are pretty damning proofs, and\r\nbesides he was caught, they say, swindling the Public Food Committee.\r\nHe drew rations for fifty, how, I don’t know. He claims to be an\r\nAmerican artist here, and we have been obliged to take notice of it at\r\nthe Legation. It’s a nasty affair.”\r\n\r\n“To cheat the people at such a time is worse than robbing the\r\npoor-box,” cried Trent angrily. “Let them shoot him!”\r\n\r\n“He’s an American citizen.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, oh yes,” said the other with bitterness. “American citizenship is\r\na precious privilege when every goggle-eyed German—” His anger choked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSouthwark shook hands with him warmly. “It can’t be helped, we must\r\nown the carrion. I am afraid you may be called upon to identify him as\r\nan American artist,” he said with a ghost of a smile on his deep-lined\r\nface; and walked away through the Cours la Reine.\r\n\r\nTrent swore silently for a moment and then drew out his watch. Seven\r\no’clock. “Sylvia will be anxious,” he thought, and hurried back to\r\nthe river. The crowd still huddled shivering on the bridge, a sombre\r\npitiful congregation, peering out into the night for the signals of the\r\nArmy of the Loire: and their hearts beat time to the pounding of the\r\nguns, their eyes lighted with each flash from the bastions, and hope\r\nrose with the drifting rockets.\r\n\r\nA black cloud hung over the fortifications. From horizon to horizon\r\nthe cannon smoke stretched in wavering bands, now capping the spires\r\nand domes with cloud, now blowing in streamers and shreds along the\r\nstreets, now descending from the housetops, enveloping quays, bridges,\r\nand river, in a sulphurous mist. And through the smoke pall the\r\nlightning of the cannon played, while from time to time a rift above\r\nshowed a fathomless black vault set with stars.\r\n\r\nHe turned again into the rue de Seine, that sad abandoned street, with\r\nits rows of closed shutters and desolate ranks of unlighted lamps. He\r\nwas a little nervous and wished once or twice for a revolver, but the\r\nslinking forms which passed him in the darkness were too weak with\r\nhunger to be dangerous, he thought, and he passed on unmolested to his\r\ndoorway. But there somebody sprang at his throat. Over and over the icy\r\npavement he rolled with his assailant, tearing at the noose about his\r\nneck, and then with a wrench sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Get up,” he cried to the other.\r\n\r\nSlowly and with great deliberation, a small gamin picked himself out of\r\nthe gutter and surveyed Trent with disgust.\r\n\r\n“That’s a nice clean trick,” said Trent; “a whelp of your age! You’ll\r\nfinish against a dead wall! Give me that cord!”\r\n\r\nThe urchin handed him the noose without a word.\r\n\r\nTrent struck a match and looked at his assailant. It was the rat-killer\r\nof the day before.\r\n\r\n“H’m! I thought so,” he muttered.\r\n\r\n“Tiens, c’est toi?” said the gamin tranquilly.\r\n\r\nThe impudence, the overpowering audacity of the ragamuffin took Trent’s\r\nbreath away.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, you young strangler,” he gasped, “that they shoot thieves\r\nof your age?”\r\n\r\nThe child turned a passionless face to Trent. “Shoot, then.”\r\n\r\nThat was too much, and he turned on his heel and entered his hotel.\r\n\r\nGroping up the unlighted stairway, he at last reached his own landing\r\nand felt about in the darkness for the door. From his studio came\r\nthe sound of voices, West’s hearty laugh and Fallowby’s chuckle, and\r\nat last he found the knob and, pushing back the door, stood a moment\r\nconfused by the light.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Jack!” cried West, “you’re a pleasant creature, inviting people\r\nto dine and letting them wait. Here’s Fallowby weeping with hunger—”\r\n\r\n“Shut up,” observed the latter, “perhaps he’s been out to buy a turkey.”\r\n\r\n“He’s been out garroting, look at his noose!” laughed Guernalec.\r\n\r\n“So now we know where you get your cash!” added West; “vive le coup du\r\nPère François!”\r\n\r\nTrent shook hands with everybody and laughed at Sylvia’s pale face.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean to be late; I stopped on the bridge a moment to watch\r\nthe bombardment. Were you anxious, Sylvia?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled and murmured, “Oh, no!” but her hand dropped into his and\r\ntightened convulsively.\r\n\r\n“To the table!” shouted Fallowby, and uttered a joyous whoop.\r\n\r\n“Take it easy,” observed Thorne, with a remnant of manners; “you are\r\nnot the host, you know.”\r\n\r\nMarie Guernalec, who had been chattering with Colette, jumped up and\r\ntook Thorne’s arm and Monsieur Guernalec drew Odile’s arm through his.\r\n\r\nTrent, bowing gravely, offered his own arm to Colette, West took in\r\nSylvia, and Fallowby hovered anxiously in the rear.\r\n\r\n“You march around the table three times singing the Marseillaise,”\r\nexplained Sylvia, “and Monsieur Fallowby pounds on the table and beats\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\nFallowby suggested that they could sing after dinner, but his protest\r\nwas drowned in the ringing chorus—\r\n\r\n                               “Aux armes!\r\n                         Formez vos bataillons!”\r\n\r\nAround the room they marched singing,\r\n\r\n                          “Marchons! Marchons!”\r\n\r\nwith all their might, while Fallowby with very bad grace, hammered on\r\nthe table, consoling himself a little with the hope that the exercise\r\nwould increase his appetite. Hercules, the black and tan, fled under\r\nthe bed, from which retreat he yapped and whined until dragged out by\r\nGuernalec and placed in Odile’s lap.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Trent gravely, when everybody was seated, “listen!” and\r\nhe read the menu.\r\n\r\n                     Beef Soup à la Siège de Paris.\r\n\r\n                                  Fish.\r\n                      Sardines à la père Lachaise.\r\n                              (White Wine).\r\n\r\n                            Rôti (Red Wine).\r\n                         Fresh Beef à la sortie.\r\n\r\n                               Vegetables.\r\n                      Canned Beans à la chasse-pot,\r\n                         Canned Peas Gravelotte,\r\n                          Potatoes Irlandaises,\r\n                             Miscellaneous.\r\n\r\n                      Cold Corned Beef à la Thieis,\r\n                      Stewed Prunes à la Garibaldi.\r\n\r\n                                Dessert.\r\n                       Dried prunes—White bread,\r\n                             Currant Jelly,\r\n                               Tea—Café,\r\n                                Liqueurs,\r\n                          Pipes and Cigarettes.\r\n\r\nFallowby applauded frantically, and Sylvia served the soup.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it delicious?” sighed Odile.\r\n\r\nMarie Guernalec sipped her soup in rapture.\r\n\r\n“Not at all like horse, and I don’t care what they say, horse doesn’t\r\ntaste like beef,” whispered Colette to West. Fallowby, who had\r\nfinished, began to caress his chin and eye the tureen.\r\n\r\n“Have some more, old chap?” inquired Trent.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Fallowby cannot have any more,” announced Sylvia; “I am\r\nsaving this for the concierge.” Fallowby transferred his eyes to the\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nThe sardines, hot from the grille, were a great success. While the\r\nothers were eating Sylvia ran downstairs with the soup for the old\r\nconcierge and her husband, and when she hurried back, flushed and\r\nbreathless, and had slipped into her chair with a happy smile at Trent,\r\nthat young man arose, and silence fell over the table. For an instant\r\nhe looked at Sylvia and thought he had never seen her so beautiful.\r\n\r\n“You all know,” he began, “that to-day is my wife’s nineteenth\r\nbirthday—”\r\n\r\nFallowby, bubbling with enthusiasm, waved his glass in circles about\r\nhis head to the terror of Odile and Colette, his neighbours, and\r\nThorne, West and Guernalec refilled their glasses three times before\r\nthe storm of applause which the toast of Sylvia had provoked, subsided.\r\n\r\nThree times the glasses were filled and emptied to Sylvia, and again to\r\nTrent, who protested.\r\n\r\n“This is irregular,” he cried, “the next toast is to the twin\r\nRepublics, France and America?”\r\n\r\n“To the Republics! To the Republics!” they cried, and the toast was\r\ndrunk amid shouts of “Vive la France! Vive l’Amérique! Vive la Nation!”\r\n\r\nThen Trent, with a smile at West, offered the toast, “To a Happy Pair!”\r\nand everybody understood, and Sylvia leaned over and kissed Colette,\r\nwhile Trent bowed to West.\r\n\r\nThe beef was eaten in comparative calm, but when it was finished and a\r\nportion of it set aside for the old people below, Trent cried: “Drink\r\nto Paris! May she rise from her ruins and crush the invader!” and the\r\ncheers rang out, drowning for a moment the monotonous thunder of the\r\nPrussian guns.\r\n\r\nPipes and cigarettes were lighted, and Trent listened an instant to the\r\nanimated chatter around him, broken by ripples of laughter from the\r\ngirls or the mellow chuckle of Fallowby. Then he turned to West.\r\n\r\n“There is going to be a sortie to-night,” he said. “I saw the American\r\nAmbulance surgeon just before I came in and he asked me to speak to you\r\nfellows. Any aid we can give him will not come amiss.”\r\n\r\nThen dropping his voice and speaking in English, “As for me, I shall go\r\nout with the ambulance to-morrow morning. There is of course no danger,\r\nbut it’s just as well to keep it from Sylvia.”\r\n\r\nWest nodded. Thorne and Guernalec, who had heard, broke in and offered\r\nassistance, and Fallowby volunteered with a groan.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Trent rapidly,—“no more now, but meet me at\r\nAmbulance headquarters to-morrow morning at eight.”\r\n\r\nSylvia and Colette, who were becoming uneasy at the conversation in\r\nEnglish, now demanded to know what they were talking about.\r\n\r\n“What does a sculptor usually talk about?” cried West, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nOdile glanced reproachfully at Thorne, her _fiancé_.\r\n\r\n“You are not French, you know, and it is none of your business, this\r\nwar,” said Odile with much dignity.\r\n\r\nThorne looked meek, but West assumed an air of outraged virtue.\r\n\r\n“It seems,” he said to Fallowby, “that a fellow cannot discuss the\r\nbeauties of Greek sculpture in his mother tongue, without being openly\r\nsuspected.”\r\n\r\nColette placed her hand over his mouth and turning to Sylvia, murmured,\r\n“They are horridly untruthful, these men.”\r\n\r\n“I believe the word for ambulance is the same in both languages,” said\r\nMarie Guernalec saucily; “Sylvia, don’t trust Monsieur Trent.”\r\n\r\n“Jack,” whispered Sylvia, “promise me—”\r\n\r\nA knock at the studio door interrupted her.\r\n\r\n“Come in!” cried Fallowby, but Trent sprang up, and opening the door,\r\nlooked out. Then with a hasty excuse to the rest, he stepped into the\r\nhallway and closed the door.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned he was grumbling.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Jack?” cried West.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” repeated Trent savagely; “I’ll tell you what it is. I\r\nhave received a dispatch from the American Minister to go at once and\r\nidentify and claim, as a fellow-countryman and a brother artist, a\r\nrascally thief and a German spy!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t go,” suggested Fallowby.\r\n\r\n“If I don’t they’ll shoot him at once.”\r\n\r\n“Let them,” growled Thorne.\r\n\r\n“Do you fellows know who it is?”\r\n\r\n“Hartman!” shouted West, inspired.\r\n\r\nSylvia sprang up deathly white, but Odile slipped her arm around her\r\nand supported her to a chair, saying calmly, “Sylvia has fainted,—it’s\r\nthe hot room,—bring some water.”\r\n\r\nTrent brought it at once.\r\n\r\nSylvia opened her eyes, and after a moment rose, and supported by Marie\r\nGuernalec and Trent, passed into the bedroom.\r\n\r\nIt was the signal for breaking up, and everybody came and shook hands\r\nwith Trent, saying they hoped Sylvia would sleep it off and that it\r\nwould be nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen Marie Guernalec took leave of him, she avoided his eyes, but he\r\nspoke to her cordially and thanked her for her aid.\r\n\r\n“Anything I can do, Jack?” inquired West, lingering, and then hurried\r\ndownstairs to catch up with the rest.\r\n\r\nTrent leaned over the banisters, listening to their footsteps and\r\nchatter, and then the lower door banged and the house was silent.\r\nHe lingered, staring down into the blackness, biting his lips; then\r\nwith an impatient movement, “I am crazy!” he muttered, and lighting a\r\ncandle, went into the bedroom. Sylvia was lying on the bed. He bent\r\nover her, smoothing the curly hair on her forehead.\r\n\r\n“Are you better, dear Sylvia?”\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, but raised her eyes to his. For an instant he met\r\nher gaze, but what he read there sent a chill to his heart and he sat\r\ndown covering his face with his hands.\r\n\r\nAt last she spoke in a voice, changed and strained,—a voice which he\r\nhad never heard, and he dropped his hands and listened, bolt upright in\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\n“Jack, it has come at last. I have feared it and trembled,—ah! how\r\noften have I lain awake at night with this on my heart and prayed that\r\nI might die before you should ever know of it! For I love you, Jack,\r\nand if you go away I cannot live. I have deceived you;—it happened\r\nbefore I knew you, but since that first day when you found me weeping\r\nin the Luxembourg and spoke to me, Jack, I have been faithful to you in\r\nevery thought and deed. I loved you from the first, and did not dare to\r\ntell you this—fearing that you would go away; and since then my love\r\nhas grown—grown—and oh! I suffered!—but I dared not tell you. And\r\nnow you know, but you do not know the worst. For him—now—what do I\r\ncare? He was cruel—oh, so cruel!”\r\n\r\nShe hid her face in her arms.\r\n\r\n“Must I go on? Must I tell you—can you not imagine, oh! Jack—”\r\n\r\nHe did not stir; his eyes seemed dead.\r\n\r\n“I—I was so young, I knew nothing, and he said—said that he loved\r\nme—”\r\n\r\nTrent rose and struck the candle with his clenched fist, and the room\r\nwas dark.\r\n\r\nThe bells of St. Sulpice tolled the hour, and she started up, speaking\r\nwith feverish haste,—“I must finish! When you told me you loved\r\nme—you—you asked me nothing; but then, even then, it was too late,\r\nand _that other life_ which binds me to him, must stand for ever\r\nbetween you and me! For there _is another_ whom he has claimed, and is\r\ngood to. He must not die,—they cannot shoot him, for that _other’s_\r\nsake!”\r\n\r\nTrent sat motionless, but his thoughts ran on in an interminable whirl.\r\n\r\nSylvia, little Sylvia, who shared with him his student life,—who bore\r\nwith him the dreary desolation of the siege without complaint,—this\r\nslender blue-eyed girl whom he was so quietly fond of, whom he teased\r\nor caressed as the whim suited, who sometimes made him the least bit\r\nimpatient with her passionate devotion to him,—could this be the same\r\nSylvia who lay weeping there in the darkness?\r\n\r\nThen he clinched his teeth. “Let him die! Let him die!”—but then,—for\r\nSylvia’s sake, and,—for that _other’s_ sake,—Yes, he would go,—he\r\n_must_ go,—his duty was plain before him. But Sylvia,—he could not be\r\nwhat he had been to her, and yet a vague terror seized him, now all was\r\nsaid. Trembling, he struck a light.\r\n\r\nShe lay there, her curly hair tumbled about her face, her small white\r\nhands pressed to her breast.\r\n\r\nHe could not leave her, and he could not stay. He never knew before\r\nthat he loved her. She had been a mere comrade, this girl wife of his.\r\nAh! he loved her now with all his heart and soul, and he knew it, only\r\nwhen it was too late. Too late? Why? Then he thought of that _other_\r\none, binding her, linking her forever to the creature, who stood in\r\ndanger of his life. With an oath he sprang to the door, but the door\r\nwould not open,—or was it that he pressed it back,—locked it,—and\r\nflung himself on his knees beside the bed, knowing that he dared not\r\nfor his life’s sake leave what was his all in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nIt was four in the morning when he came out of the Prison of the\r\nCondemned with the Secretary of the American Legation. A knot of people\r\nhad gathered around the American Minister’s carriage, which stood in\r\nfront of the prison, the horses stamping and pawing in the icy street,\r\nthe coachman huddled on the box, wrapped in furs. Southwark helped the\r\nSecretary into the carriage, and shook hands with Trent, thanking him\r\nfor coming.\r\n\r\n“How the scoundrel did stare,” he said; “your evidence was worse than\r\na kick, but it saved his skin for the moment at least,—and prevented\r\ncomplications.”\r\n\r\nThe Secretary sighed. “We have done our part. Now let them prove him a\r\nspy and we wash our hands of him. Jump in, Captain! Come along, Trent!”\r\n\r\n“I have a word to say to Captain Southwark, I won’t detain him,” said\r\nTrent hastily, and dropping his voice, “Southwark, help _me_ now. You\r\nknow the story from the blackguard. You know the—the child is at his\r\nrooms. Get it, and take it to my own apartment, and if he is shot, I\r\nwill provide a home for it.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said the Captain gravely.\r\n\r\n“Will you do this at once?”\r\n\r\n“At once,” he replied.\r\n\r\nTheir hands met in a warm clasp, and then Captain Southwark climbed\r\ninto the carriage, motioning Trent to follow; but he shook his head\r\nsaying, “Good-bye!” and the carriage rolled away.\r\n\r\nHe watched the carriage to the end of the street, then started toward\r\nhis own quarter, but after a step or two hesitated, stopped, and\r\nfinally turned away in the opposite direction. Something—perhaps it\r\nwas the sight of the prisoner he had so recently confronted nauseated\r\nhim. He felt the need of solitude and quiet to collect his thoughts.\r\nThe events of the evening had shaken him terribly, but he would walk it\r\noff, forget, bury everything, and then go back to Sylvia. He started on\r\nswiftly, and for a time the bitter thoughts seemed to fade, but when he\r\npaused at last, breathless, under the Arc de Triomphe, the bitterness\r\nand the wretchedness of the whole thing—yes, of his whole misspent\r\nlife came back with a pang. Then the face of the prisoner, stamped with\r\nthe horrible grimace of fear, grew in the shadows before his eyes.\r\n\r\nSick at heart he wandered up and down under the great Arc, striving\r\nto occupy his mind, peering up at the sculptured cornices to read the\r\nnames of the heroes and battles which he knew were engraved there,\r\nbut always the ashen face of Hartman followed him, grinning with\r\nterror!—or was it terror?—was it not triumph?—At the thought he\r\nleaped like a man who feels a knife at his throat, but after a savage\r\ntramp around the square, came back again and sat down to battle with\r\nhis misery.\r\n\r\nThe air was cold, but his cheeks were burning with angry shame. Shame?\r\nWhy? Was it because he had married a girl whom chance had made a\r\nmother? _Did_ he love her? Was this miserable bohemian existence, then,\r\nhis end and aim in life? He turned his eyes upon the secrets of his\r\nheart, and read an evil story,—the story of the past, and he covered\r\nhis face for shame, while, keeping time to the dull pain throbbing\r\nin his head, his heart beat out the story for the future. Shame and\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nRoused at last from a lethargy which had begun to numb the bitterness\r\nof his thoughts, he raised his head and looked about. A sudden fog had\r\nsettled in the streets; the arches of the Arc were choked with it. He\r\nwould go home. A great horror of being alone seized him. _But he was\r\nnot alone._ The fog was peopled with phantoms. All around him in the\r\nmist they moved, drifting through the arches in lengthening lines,\r\nand vanished, while from the fog others rose up, swept past and were\r\nengulfed. He was not alone, for even at his side they crowded, touched\r\nhim, swarmed before him, beside him, behind him, pressed him back,\r\nseized, and bore him with them through the mist. Down a dim avenue,\r\nthrough lanes and alleys white with fog, they moved, and if they spoke\r\ntheir voices were dull as the vapour which shrouded them. At last in\r\nfront, a bank of masonry and earth cut by a massive iron barred gate\r\ntowered up in the fog. Slowly and more slowly they glided, shoulder to\r\nshoulder and thigh to thigh. Then all movement ceased. A sudden breeze\r\nstirred the fog. It wavered and eddied. Objects became more distinct.\r\nA pallor crept above the horizon, touching the edges of the watery\r\nclouds, and drew dull sparks from a thousand bayonets. Bayonets—they\r\nwere everywhere, cleaving the fog or flowing beneath it in rivers of\r\nsteel. High on the wall of masonry and earth a great gun loomed, and\r\naround it figures moved in silhouettes. Below, a broad torrent of\r\nbayonets swept through the iron barred gateway, out into the shadowy\r\nplain. It became lighter. Faces grew more distinct among the marching\r\nmasses and he recognized one.\r\n\r\n“You, Philippe!”\r\n\r\nThe figure turned its head.\r\n\r\nTrent cried, “Is there room for me?” but the other only waved his arm\r\nin a vague adieu and was gone with the rest. Presently the cavalry\r\nbegan to pass, squadron on squadron, crowding out into the darkness;\r\nthen many cannon, then an ambulance, then again the endless lines of\r\nbayonets. Beside him a cuirassier sat on his steaming horse, and in\r\nfront, among a group of mounted officers he saw a general, with the\r\nastrakan collar of his dolman turned up about his bloodless face.\r\n\r\nSome women were weeping near him and one was struggling to force a loaf\r\nof black bread into a soldier’s haversack. The soldier tried to aid\r\nher, but the sack was fastened, and his rifle bothered him, so Trent\r\nheld it, while the woman unbuttoned the sack and forced in the bread,\r\nnow all wet with her tears. The rifle was not heavy. Trent found it\r\nwonderfully manageable. Was the bayonet sharp? He tried it. Then a\r\nsudden longing, a fierce, imperative desire took possession of him.\r\n\r\n“_Chouette!_” cried a gamin, clinging to the barred gate, “_encore toi\r\nmon vieux_?”\r\n\r\nTrent looked up, and the rat-killer laughed in his face. But when the\r\nsoldier had taken the rifle again, and thanking him, ran hard to catch\r\nhis battalion, he plunged into the throng about the gateway.\r\n\r\n“Are you going?” he cried to a marine who sat in the gutter bandaging\r\nhis foot.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThen a girl—a mere child—caught him by the hand and led him into\r\nthe café which faced the gate. The room was crowded with soldiers,\r\nsome, white and silent, sitting on the floor, others groaning on the\r\nleather-covered settees. The air was sour and suffocating.\r\n\r\n“Choose!” said the girl with a little gesture of pity; “they can’t go!”\r\n\r\nIn a heap of clothing on the floor he found a capote and képi.\r\n\r\nShe helped him buckle his knapsack, cartridge-box, and belt, and showed\r\nhim how to load the chasse-pot rifle, holding it on her knees.\r\n\r\nWhen he thanked her she started to her feet.\r\n\r\n“You are a foreigner!”\r\n\r\n“American,” he said, moving toward the door, but the child barred his\r\nway.\r\n\r\n“I am a Bretonne. My father is up there with the cannon of the marine.\r\nHe will shoot you if you are a spy.”\r\n\r\nThey faced each other for a moment. Then sighing, he bent over and\r\nkissed the child. “Pray for France, little one,” he murmured, and she\r\nrepeated with a pale smile: “For France and you, beau Monsieur.”\r\n\r\nHe ran across the street and through the gateway. Once outside, he\r\nedged into line and shouldered his way along the road. A corporal\r\npassed, looked at him, repassed, and finally called an officer. “You\r\nbelong to the 60th,” growled the corporal looking at the number on his\r\nképi.\r\n\r\n“We have no use for Franc-tireurs,” added the officer, catching sight\r\nof his black trousers.\r\n\r\n“I wish to volunteer in place of a comrade,” said Trent, and the\r\nofficer shrugged his shoulders and passed on.\r\n\r\nNobody paid much attention to him, one or two merely glancing at his\r\ntrousers. The road was deep with slush and mud-ploughed and torn by\r\nwheels and hoofs. A soldier in front of him wrenched his foot in an\r\nicy rut and dragged himself to the edge of the embankment groaning.\r\nThe plain on either side of them was grey with melting snow. Here and\r\nthere behind dismantled hedge-rows stood wagons, bearing white flags\r\nwith red crosses. Sometimes the driver was a priest in rusty hat and\r\ngown, sometimes a crippled Mobile. Once they passed a wagon driven by a\r\nSister of Charity. Silent empty houses with great rents in their walls,\r\nand every window blank, huddled along the road. Further on, within the\r\nzone of danger, nothing of human habitation remained except here and\r\nthere a pile of frozen bricks or a blackened cellar choked with snow.\r\n\r\nFor some time Trent had been annoyed by the man behind him, who kept\r\ntreading on his heels. Convinced at last that it was intentional,\r\nhe turned to remonstrate and found himself face to face with a\r\nfellow-student from the Beaux Arts. Trent stared.\r\n\r\n“I thought you were in the hospital!”\r\n\r\nThe other shook his head, pointing to his bandaged jaw.\r\n\r\n“I see, you can’t speak. Can I do anything?”\r\n\r\nThe wounded man rummaged in his haversack and produced a crust of black\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n“He can’t eat it, his jaw is smashed, and he wants you to chew it for\r\nhim,” said the soldier next to him.\r\n\r\nTrent took the crust, and grinding it in his teeth morsel by morsel,\r\npassed it back to the starving man.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time mounted orderlies sped to the front, covering them\r\nwith slush. It was a chilly, silent march through sodden meadows\r\nwreathed in fog. Along the railroad embankment across the ditch,\r\nanother column moved parallel to their own. Trent watched it, a sombre\r\nmass, now distinct, now vague, now blotted out in a puff of fog. Once\r\nfor half-an-hour he lost it, but when again it came into view, he\r\nnoticed a thin line detach itself from the flank, and, bellying in\r\nthe middle, swing rapidly to the west. At the same moment a prolonged\r\ncrackling broke out in the fog in front. Other lines began to slough\r\noff from the column, swinging east and west, and the crackling became\r\ncontinuous. A battery passed at full gallop, and he drew back with his\r\ncomrades to give it way. It went into action a little to the right\r\nof his battalion, and as the shot from the first rifled piece boomed\r\nthrough the mist, the cannon from the fortifications opened with a\r\nmighty roar. An officer galloped by shouting something which Trent did\r\nnot catch, but he saw the ranks in front suddenly part company with his\r\nown, and disappear in the twilight. More officers rode up and stood\r\nbeside him peering into the fog. Away in front the crackling had become\r\none prolonged crash. It was dreary waiting. Trent chewed some bread for\r\nthe man behind, who tried to swallow it, and after a while shook his\r\nhead, motioning Trent to eat the rest himself. A corporal offered him a\r\nlittle brandy and he drank it, but when he turned around to return the\r\nflask, the corporal was lying on the ground. Alarmed, he looked at the\r\nsoldier next to him, who shrugged his shoulders and opened his mouth\r\nto speak, but something struck him and he rolled over and over into\r\nthe ditch below. At that moment the horse of one of the officers gave\r\na bound and backed into the battalion, lashing out with his heels. One\r\nman was ridden down; another was kicked in the chest and hurled through\r\nthe ranks. The officer sank his spurs into the horse and forced him\r\nto the front again, where he stood trembling. The cannonade seemed to\r\ndraw nearer. A staff-officer, riding slowly up and down the battalion\r\nsuddenly collapsed in his saddle and clung to his horse’s mane. One\r\nof his boots dangled, crimsoned and dripping, from the stirrup. Then\r\nout of the mist in front men came running. The roads, the fields,\r\nthe ditches were full of them, and many of them fell. For an instant\r\nhe imagined he saw horsemen riding about like ghosts in the vapours\r\nbeyond, and a man behind him cursed horribly, declaring he too had seen\r\nthem, and that they were Uhlans; but the battalion stood inactive, and\r\nthe mist fell again over the meadows.\r\n\r\nThe colonel sat heavily upon his horse, his bullet-shaped head buried\r\nin the astrakan collar of his dolman, his fat legs sticking straight\r\nout in the stirrups.\r\n\r\nThe buglers clustered about him with bugles poised, and behind him a\r\nstaff-officer in a pale blue jacket smoked a cigarette and chatted\r\nwith a captain of hussars. From the road in front came the sound of\r\nfurious galloping and an orderly reined up beside the colonel, who\r\nmotioned him to the rear without turning his head. Then on the left a\r\nconfused murmur arose which ended in a shout. A hussar passed like the\r\nwind, followed by another and another, and then squadron after squadron\r\nwhirled by them into the sheeted mists. At that instant the colonel\r\nreared in his saddle, the bugles clanged, and the whole battalion\r\nscrambled down the embankment, over the ditch and started across the\r\nsoggy meadow. Almost at once Trent lost his cap. Something snatched\r\nit from his head, he thought it was a tree branch. A good many of\r\nhis comrades rolled over in the slush and ice, and he imagined that\r\nthey had slipped. One pitched right across his path and he stopped to\r\nhelp him up, but the man screamed when he touched him and an officer\r\nshouted, “Forward! Forward!” so he ran on again. It was a long jog\r\nthrough the mist, and he was often obliged to shift his rifle. When at\r\nlast they lay panting behind the railroad embankment, he looked about\r\nhim. He had felt the need of action, of a desperate physical struggle,\r\nof killing and crushing. He had been seized with a desire to fling\r\nhimself among masses and tear right and left. He longed to fire, to use\r\nthe thin sharp bayonet on his chasse-pot. He had not expected this.\r\nHe wished to become exhausted, to struggle and cut until incapable\r\nof lifting his arm. Then he had intended to go home. He heard a man\r\nsay that half the battalion had gone down in the charge, and he saw\r\nanother examining a corpse under the embankment. The body, still warm,\r\nwas clothed in a strange uniform, but even when he noticed the spiked\r\nhelmet lying a few inches further away, he did not realize what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nThe colonel sat on his horse a few feet to the left, his eyes sparkling\r\nunder the crimson képi. Trent heard him reply to an officer: “I can\r\nhold it, but another charge, and I won’t have enough men left to sound\r\na bugle.”\r\n\r\n“Were the Prussians here?” Trent asked of a soldier who sat wiping the\r\nblood trickling from his hair.\r\n\r\n“Yes. The hussars cleaned them out. We caught their cross fire.”\r\n\r\n“We are supporting a battery on the embankment,” said another.\r\n\r\nThen the battalion crawled over the embankment and moved along the\r\nlines of twisted rails. Trent rolled up his trousers and tucked them\r\ninto his woollen socks: but they halted again, and some of the men sat\r\ndown on the dismantled railroad track. Trent looked for his wounded\r\ncomrade from the Beaux Arts. He was standing in his place, very pale.\r\nThe cannonade had become terrific. For a moment the mist lifted. He\r\ncaught a glimpse of the first battalion motionless on the railroad\r\ntrack in front, of regiments on either flank, and then, as the fog\r\nsettled again, the drums beat and the music of the bugles began away\r\non the extreme left. A restless movement passed among the troops, the\r\ncolonel threw up his arm, the drums rolled, and the battalion moved\r\noff through the fog. They were near the front now for the battalion\r\nwas firing as it advanced. Ambulances galloped along the base of the\r\nembankment to the rear, and the hussars passed and repassed like\r\nphantoms. They were in the front at last, for all about them was\r\nmovement and turmoil, while from the fog, close at hand, came cries and\r\ngroans and crashing volleys. Shells fell everywhere, bursting along the\r\nembankment, splashing them with frozen slush. Trent was frightened.\r\nHe began to dread the unknown, which lay there crackling and flaming\r\nin obscurity. The shock of the cannon sickened him. He could even see\r\nthe fog light up with a dull orange as the thunder shook the earth. It\r\nwas near, he felt certain, for the colonel shouted “Forward!” and the\r\nfirst battalion was hastening into it. He felt its breath, he trembled,\r\nbut hurried on. A fearful discharge in front terrified him. Somewhere\r\nin the fog men were cheering, and the colonel’s horse, streaming with\r\nblood plunged about in the smoke.\r\n\r\nAnother blast and shock, right in his face, almost stunned him, and he\r\nfaltered. All the men to the right were down. His head swam; the fog\r\nand smoke stupefied him. He put out his hand for a support and caught\r\nsomething. It was the wheel of a gun-carriage, and a man sprang from\r\nbehind it, aiming a blow at his head with a rammer, but stumbled back\r\nshrieking with a bayonet through his neck, and Trent knew that he had\r\nkilled. Mechanically he stooped to pick up his rifle, but the bayonet\r\nwas still in the man, who lay, beating with red hands against the sod.\r\nIt sickened him and he leaned on the cannon. Men were fighting all\r\naround him now, and the air was foul with smoke and sweat. Somebody\r\nseized him from behind and another in front, but others in turn seized\r\nthem or struck them solid blows. The click! click! click! of bayonets\r\ninfuriated him, and he grasped the rammer and struck out blindly until\r\nit was shivered to pieces.\r\n\r\nA man threw his arm around his neck and bore him to the ground, but he\r\nthrottled him and raised himself on his knees. He saw a comrade seize\r\nthe cannon, and fall across it with his skull crushed in; he saw the\r\ncolonel tumble clean out of his saddle into the mud; then consciousness\r\nfled.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to himself, he was lying on the embankment among the\r\ntwisted rails. On every side huddled men who cried out and cursed and\r\nfled away into the fog, and he staggered to his feet and followed\r\nthem. Once he stopped to help a comrade with a bandaged jaw, who could\r\nnot speak but clung to his arm for a time and then fell dead in the\r\nfreezing mire; and again he aided another, who groaned: “Trent, c’est\r\nmoi—Philippe,” until a sudden volley in the midst relieved him of his\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nAn icy wind swept down from the heights, cutting the fog into shreds.\r\nFor an instant, with an evil leer the sun peered through the naked\r\nwoods of Vincennes, sank like a blood-clot in the battery smoke, lower,\r\nlower, into the blood-soaked plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nWhen midnight sounded from the belfry of St. Sulpice the gates of Paris\r\nwere still choked with fragments of what had once been an army.\r\n\r\nThey entered with the night, a sullen horde, spattered with slime,\r\nfaint with hunger and exhaustion. There was little disorder at first,\r\nand the throng at the gates parted silently as the troops tramped along\r\nthe freezing streets. Confusion came as the hours passed. Swiftly and\r\nmore swiftly, crowding squadron after squadron and battery on battery,\r\nhorses plunging and caissons jolting, the remnants from the front\r\nsurged through the gates, a chaos of cavalry and artillery struggling\r\nfor the right of way. Close upon them stumbled the infantry; here a\r\nskeleton of a regiment marching with a desperate attempt at order,\r\nthere a riotous mob of Mobiles crushing their way to the streets, then\r\na turmoil of horsemen, cannon, troops without, officers, officers\r\nwithout men, then again a line of ambulances, the wheels groaning under\r\ntheir heavy loads.\r\n\r\nDumb with misery the crowd looked on.\r\n\r\nAll through the day the ambulances had been arriving, and all day long\r\nthe ragged throng whimpered and shivered by the barriers. At noon the\r\ncrowd was increased ten-fold, filling the squares about the gates, and\r\nswarming over the inner fortifications.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock in the afternoon the German batteries suddenly wreathed\r\nthemselves in smoke, and the shells fell fast on Montparnasse. At\r\ntwenty minutes after four two projectiles struck a house in the rue de\r\nBac, and a moment later the first shell fell in the Latin Quarter.\r\n\r\nBraith was painting in bed when West came in very much scared.\r\n\r\n“I wish you would come down; our house has been knocked into a cocked\r\nhat, and I’m afraid that some of the pillagers may take it into their\r\nheads to pay us a visit to-night.”\r\n\r\nBraith jumped out of bed and bundled himself into a garment which had\r\nonce been an overcoat.\r\n\r\n“Anybody hurt?” he inquired, struggling with a sleeve full of\r\ndilapidated lining.\r\n\r\n“No. Colette is barricaded in the cellar, and the concierge ran away to\r\nthe fortifications. There will be a rough gang there if the bombardment\r\nkeeps up. You might help us—”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Braith; but it was not until they had reached the rue\r\nSerpente and had turned in the passage which led to West’s cellar, that\r\nthe latter cried: “Have you seen Jack Trent, to-day?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Braith, looking troubled, “he was not at Ambulance\r\nHeadquarters.”\r\n\r\n“He stayed to take care of Sylvia, I suppose.”\r\n\r\nA bomb came crashing through the roof of a house at the end of the\r\nalley and burst in the basement, showering the street with slate\r\nand plaster. A second struck a chimney and plunged into the garden,\r\nfollowed by an avalanche of bricks, and another exploded with a\r\ndeafening report in the next street.\r\n\r\nThey hurried along the passage to the steps which led to the cellar.\r\nHere again Braith stopped.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think I had better run up to see if Jack and Sylvia are well\r\nentrenched? I can get back before dark.”\r\n\r\n“No. Go in and find Colette, and I’ll go.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, let me go, there’s no danger.”\r\n\r\n“I know it,” replied West calmly; and, dragging Braith into the alley,\r\npointed to the cellar steps. The iron door was barred.\r\n\r\n“Colette! Colette!” he called. The door swung inward, and the girl\r\nsprang up the stairs to meet them. At that instant, Braith, glancing\r\nbehind him, gave a startled cry, and pushing the two before him into\r\nthe cellar, jumped down after them and slammed the iron door. A few\r\nseconds later a heavy jar from the outside shook the hinges.\r\n\r\n“They are here,” muttered West, very pale.\r\n\r\n“That door,” observed Colette calmly, “will hold for ever.”\r\n\r\nBraith examined the low iron structure, now trembling with the blows\r\nrained on it from without. West glanced anxiously at Colette, who\r\ndisplayed no agitation, and this comforted him.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe they will spend much time here,” said Braith; “they\r\nonly rummage in cellars for spirits, I imagine.”\r\n\r\n“Unless they hear that valuables are buried there.”\r\n\r\n“But surely nothing is buried here?” exclaimed Braith uneasily.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately there is,” growled West. “That miserly landlord of\r\nmine—”\r\n\r\nA crash from the outside, followed by a yell, cut him short; then blow\r\nafter blow shook the doors, until there came a sharp snap, a clinking\r\nof metal and a triangular bit of iron fell inwards, leaving a hole\r\nthrough which struggled a ray of light.\r\n\r\nInstantly West knelt, and shoving his revolver through the aperture\r\nfired every cartridge. For a moment the alley resounded with the racket\r\nof the revolver, then absolute silence followed.\r\n\r\nPresently a single questioning blow fell upon the door, and a moment\r\nlater another and another, and then a sudden crack zigzagged across the\r\niron plate.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said West, seizing Colette by the wrist, “you follow me,\r\nBraith!” and he ran swiftly toward a circular spot of light at the\r\nfurther end of the cellar. The spot of light came from a barred\r\nman-hole above. West motioned Braith to mount on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Push it over. You _must_!”\r\n\r\nWith little effort Braith lifted the barred cover, scrambled out on his\r\nstomach, and easily raised Colette from West’s shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Quick, old chap!” cried the latter.\r\n\r\nBraith twisted his legs around a fence-chain and leaned down again.\r\nThe cellar was flooded with a yellow light, and the air reeked with\r\nthe stench of petroleum torches. The iron door still held, but a whole\r\nplate of metal was gone, and now as they looked a figure came creeping\r\nthrough, holding a torch.\r\n\r\n“Quick!” whispered Braith. “Jump!” and West hung dangling until Colette\r\ngrasped him by the collar, and he was dragged out. Then her nerves gave\r\nway and she wept hysterically, but West threw his arm around her and\r\nled her across the gardens into the next street, where Braith, after\r\nreplacing the man-hole cover and piling some stone slabs from the wall\r\nover it, rejoined them. It was almost dark. They hurried through the\r\nstreet, now only lighted by burning buildings, or the swift glare of\r\nthe shells. They gave wide berth to the fires, but at a distance saw\r\nthe flitting forms of pillagers among the _débris_. Sometimes they\r\npassed a female fury crazed with drink shrieking anathemas upon the\r\nworld, or some slouching lout whose blackened face and hands betrayed\r\nhis share in the work of destruction. At last they reached the Seine\r\nand passed the bridge, and then Braith said: “I must go back. I am\r\nnot sure of Jack and Sylvia.” As he spoke, he made way for a crowd\r\nwhich came trampling across the bridge, and along the river wall by\r\nthe d’Orsay barracks. In the midst of it West caught the measured\r\ntread of a platoon. A lantern passed, a file of bayonets, then\r\nanother lantern which glimmered on a deathly face behind, and Colette\r\ngasped, “Hartman!” and he was gone. They peered fearfully across the\r\nembankment, holding their breath. There was a shuffle of feet on the\r\nquay, and the gate of the barracks slammed. A lantern shone for a\r\nmoment at the postern, the crowd pressed to the grille, then came the\r\nclang of the volley from the stone parade.\r\n\r\nOne by one the petroleum torches flared up along the embankment, and\r\nnow the whole square was in motion. Down from the Champs Elysées\r\nand across the Place de la Concorde straggled the fragments of the\r\nbattle, a company here, and a mob there. They poured in from every\r\nstreet followed by women and children, and a great murmur, borne on\r\nthe icy wind, swept through the Arc de Triomphe and down the dark\r\navenue,—“Perdus! perdus!”\r\n\r\nA ragged end of a battalion was pressing past, the spectre of\r\nannihilation. West groaned. Then a figure sprang from the shadowy ranks\r\nand called West’s name, and when he saw it was Trent he cried out.\r\nTrent seized him, white with terror.\r\n\r\n“Sylvia?”\r\n\r\nWest stared speechless, but Colette moaned, “Oh, Sylvia! Sylvia!—and\r\nthey are shelling the Quarter!”\r\n\r\n“Trent!” shouted Braith; but he was gone, and they could not overtake\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment ceased as Trent crossed the Boulevard St. Germain,\r\nbut the entrance to the rue de Seine was blocked by a heap of smoking\r\nbricks. Everywhere the shells had torn great holes in the pavement.\r\nThe café was a wreck of splinters and glass, the book-store tottered,\r\nripped from roof to basement, and the little bakery, long since closed,\r\nbulged outward above a mass of slate and tin.\r\n\r\nHe climbed over the steaming bricks and hurried into the rue de\r\nTournon. On the corner a fire blazed, lighting up his own street, and\r\non the bank wall, beneath a shattered gas lamp, a child was writing\r\nwith a bit of cinder.\r\n\r\n                      “HERE FELL THE FIRST SHELL.”\r\n\r\nThe letters stared him in the face. The rat-killer finished and stepped\r\nback to view his work, but catching sight of Trent’s bayonet, screamed\r\nand fled, and as Trent staggered across the shattered street, from\r\nholes and crannies in the ruins fierce women fled from their work of\r\npillage, cursing him.\r\n\r\nAt first he could not find his house, for the tears blinded him, but\r\nhe felt along the wall and reached the door. A lantern burned in the\r\nconcierge’s lodge and the old man lay dead beside it. Faint with fright\r\nhe leaned a moment on his rifle, then, snatching the lantern, sprang\r\nup the stairs. He tried to call, but his tongue hardly moved. On the\r\nsecond floor he saw plaster on the stairway, and on the third the floor\r\nwas torn and the concierge lay in a pool of blood across the landing.\r\nThe next floor was his, _theirs_. The door hung from its hinges, the\r\nwalls gaped. He crept in and sank down by the bed, and there two arms\r\nwere flung around his neck, and a tear-stained face sought his own.\r\n\r\n“Sylvia!”\r\n\r\n“O Jack! Jack! Jack!”\r\n\r\nFrom the tumbled pillow beside them a child wailed.\r\n\r\n“They brought it; it is mine,” she sobbed.\r\n\r\n“Ours,” he whispered, with his arms around them both.\r\n\r\nThen from the stairs below came Braith’s anxious voice.\r\n\r\n“Trent! Is all well?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE STREET OF OUR LADY OF THE FIELDS\r\n\r\n    “Et tout les jours passés dans la tristesse\r\n     Nous sont comptés comme des jours heureux!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nThe street is not fashionable, neither is it shabby. It is a pariah\r\namong streets—a street without a Quarter. It is generally understood\r\nto lie outside the pale of the aristocratic Avenue de l’Observatoire.\r\nThe students of the Montparnasse Quarter consider it swell and will\r\nhave none of it. The Latin Quarter, from the Luxembourg, its northern\r\nfrontier, sneers at its respectability and regards with disfavour the\r\ncorrectly costumed students who haunt it. Few strangers go into it. At\r\ntimes, however, the Latin Quarter students use it as a thoroughfare\r\nbetween the rue de Rennes and the Bullier, but except for that and the\r\nweekly afternoon visits of parents and guardians to the Convent near\r\nthe rue Vavin, the street of Our Lady of the Fields is as quiet as a\r\nPassy boulevard. Perhaps the most respectable portion lies between the\r\nrue de la Grande Chaumière and the rue Vavin, at least this was the\r\nconclusion arrived at by the Reverend Joel Byram, as he rambled through\r\nit with Hastings in charge. To Hastings the street looked pleasant in\r\nthe bright June weather, and he had begun to hope for its selection\r\nwhen the Reverend Byram shied violently at the cross on the Convent\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n“Jesuits,” he muttered.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Hastings wearily, “I imagine we won’t find anything\r\nbetter. You say yourself that vice is triumphant in Paris, and it seems\r\nto me that in every street we find Jesuits or something worse.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he repeated, “Or something worse, which of course I\r\nwould not notice except for your kindness in warning me.”\r\n\r\nDr. Byram sucked in his lips and looked about him. He was impressed\r\nby the evident respectability of the surroundings. Then frowning at\r\nthe Convent he took Hastings’ arm and shuffled across the street to an\r\niron gateway which bore the number 201 _bis_ painted in white on a blue\r\nground. Below this was a notice printed in English:\r\n\r\n      1. For Porter please oppress once.\r\n      2. For Servant please oppress twice.\r\n      3. For Parlour please oppress thrice.\r\n\r\nHastings touched the electric button three times, and they were ushered\r\nthrough the garden and into the parlour by a trim maid. The dining-room\r\ndoor, just beyond, was open, and from the table in plain view a stout\r\nwoman hastily arose and came toward them. Hastings caught a glimpse\r\nof a young man with a big head and several snuffy old gentlemen at\r\nbreakfast, before the door closed and the stout woman waddled into the\r\nroom, bringing with her an aroma of coffee and a black poodle.\r\n\r\n“It ees a plaisir to you receive!” she cried. “Monsieur is Anglish? No?\r\nAmericain? Off course. My pension it ees for Americains surtout. Here\r\nall spik Angleesh, c’est à dire, ze personnel; ze sairvants do spik,\r\nplus ou moins, a little. I am happy to have you comme pensionnaires—”\r\n\r\n“Madame,” began Dr. Byram, but was cut short again.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yess, I know, ah! mon Dieu! you do not spik Frainch but you have\r\ncome to lairne! My husband does spik Frainch wiss ze pensionnaires. We\r\nhave at ze moment a family Americaine who learn of my husband Frainch—”\r\n\r\nHere the poodle growled at Dr. Byram and was promptly cuffed by his\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n“Veux tu!” she cried, with a slap, “veux tu! Oh! le vilain, oh! le\r\nvilain!”\r\n\r\n“Mais, madame,” said Hastings, smiling, “il n’a pas l’air très féroce.”\r\n\r\nThe poodle fled, and his mistress cried, “Ah, ze accent charming! He\r\ndoes spik already Frainch like a Parisien young gentleman!”\r\n\r\nThen Dr. Byram managed to get in a word or two and gathered more or\r\nless information with regard to prices.\r\n\r\n“It ees a pension serieux; my clientèle ees of ze best, indeed a\r\npension de famille where one ees at ’ome.”\r\n\r\nThen they went upstairs to examine Hastings’ future quarters, test\r\nthe bed-springs and arrange for the weekly towel allowance. Dr. Byram\r\nappeared satisfied.\r\n\r\nMadame Marotte accompanied them to the door and rang for the maid, but\r\nas Hastings stepped out into the gravel walk, his guide and mentor\r\npaused a moment and fixed Madame with his watery eyes.\r\n\r\n“You understand,” he said, “that he is a youth of most careful bringing\r\nup, and his character and morals are without a stain. He is young and\r\nhas never been abroad, never even seen a large city, and his parents\r\nhave requested me, as an old family friend living in Paris, to see\r\nthat he is placed under good influences. He is to study art, but on no\r\naccount would his parents wish him to live in the Latin Quarter if they\r\nknew of the immorality which is rife there.”\r\n\r\nA sound like the click of a latch interrupted him and he raised his\r\neyes, but not in time to see the maid slap the big-headed young man\r\nbehind the parlour-door.\r\n\r\nMadame coughed, cast a deadly glance behind her and then beamed on Dr.\r\nByram.\r\n\r\n“It ees well zat he come here. The pension more serious, il n’en existe\r\npas, eet ees not any!” she announced with conviction.\r\n\r\nSo, as there was nothing more to add, Dr. Byram joined Hastings at the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n“I trust,” he said, eyeing the Convent, “that you will make no\r\nacquaintances among Jesuits!”\r\n\r\nHastings looked at the Convent until a pretty girl passed before the\r\ngray façade, and then he looked at her. A young fellow with a paint-box\r\nand canvas came swinging along, stopped before the pretty girl, said\r\nsomething during a brief but vigorous handshake at which they both\r\nlaughed, and he went his way, calling back, “À demain Valentine!” as in\r\nthe same breath she cried, “À demain!”\r\n\r\n“Valentine,” thought Hastings, “what a quaint name;” and he started to\r\nfollow the Reverend Joel Byram, who was shuffling towards the nearest\r\ntramway station.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n“An’ you are pleas wiz Paris, Monsieur’ Astang?” demanded Madame\r\nMarotte the next morning as Hastings came into the breakfast-room of\r\nthe pension, rosy from his plunge in the limited bath above.\r\n\r\n“I am sure I shall like it,” he replied, wondering at his own\r\ndepression of spirits.\r\n\r\nThe maid brought him coffee and rolls. He returned the vacant glance\r\nof the big-headed young man and acknowledged diffidently the salutes\r\nof the snuffy old gentlemen. He did not try to finish his coffee, and\r\nsat crumbling a roll, unconscious of the sympathetic glances of Madame\r\nMarotte, who had tact enough not to bother him.\r\n\r\nPresently a maid entered with a tray on which were balanced two bowls\r\nof chocolate, and the snuffy old gentlemen leered at her ankles. The\r\nmaid deposited the chocolate at a table near the window and smiled at\r\nHastings. Then a thin young lady, followed by her counterpart in all\r\nexcept years, marched into the room and took the table near the window.\r\nThey were evidently American, but Hastings, if he expected any sign of\r\nrecognition, was disappointed. To be ignored by compatriots intensified\r\nhis depression. He fumbled with his knife and looked at his plate.\r\n\r\nThe thin young lady was talkative enough. She was quite aware of\r\nHastings’ presence, ready to be flattered if he looked at her, but\r\non the other hand she felt her superiority, for she had been three\r\nweeks in Paris and he, it was easy to see, had not yet unpacked his\r\nsteamer-trunk.\r\n\r\nHer conversation was complacent. She argued with her mother upon the\r\nrelative merits of the Louvre and the Bon Marché, but her mother’s part\r\nof the discussion was mostly confined to the observation, “Why, Susie!”\r\n\r\nThe snuffy old gentlemen had left the room in a body, outwardly polite\r\nand inwardly raging. They could not endure the Americans, who filled\r\nthe room with their chatter.\r\n\r\nThe big-headed young man looked after them with a knowing cough,\r\nmurmuring, “Gay old birds!”\r\n\r\n“They look like bad old men, Mr. Bladen,” said the girl.\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Bladen smiled and said, “They’ve had their day,” in a tone\r\nwhich implied that he was now having his.\r\n\r\n“And that’s why they all have baggy eyes,” cried the girl. “I think\r\nit’s a shame for young gentlemen—”\r\n\r\n“Why, Susie!” said the mother, and the conversation lagged.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Mr. Bladen threw down the _Petit Journal_, which he daily\r\nstudied at the expense of the house, and turning to Hastings, started\r\nto make himself agreeable. He began by saying, “I see you are American.”\r\n\r\nTo this brilliant and original opening, Hastings, deadly homesick,\r\nreplied gratefully, and the conversation was judiciously nourished by\r\nobservations from Miss Susie Byng distinctly addressed to Mr. Bladen.\r\nIn the course of events Miss Susie, forgetting to address herself\r\nexclusively to Mr. Bladen, and Hastings replying to her general\r\nquestion, the _entente cordiale_ was established, and Susie and her\r\nmother extended a protectorate over what was clearly neutral territory.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Hastings, you must not desert the pension every evening as Mr.\r\nBladen does. Paris is an awful place for young gentlemen, and Mr.\r\nBladen is a horrid cynic.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bladen looked gratified.\r\n\r\nHastings answered, “I shall be at the studio all day, and I imagine I\r\nshall be glad enough to come back at night.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bladen, who, at a salary of fifteen dollars a week, acted as agent\r\nfor the Pewly Manufacturing Company of Troy, N.Y., smiled a sceptical\r\nsmile and withdrew to keep an appointment with a customer on the\r\nBoulevard Magenta.\r\n\r\nHastings walked into the garden with Mrs. Byng and Susie, and, at their\r\ninvitation, sat down in the shade before the iron gate.\r\n\r\nThe chestnut trees still bore their fragrant spikes of pink and white,\r\nand the bees hummed among the roses, trellised on the white-walled\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nA faint freshness was in the air. The watering carts moved up and\r\ndown the street, and a clear stream bubbled over the spotless gutters\r\nof the rue de la Grande Chaumière. The sparrows were merry along the\r\ncurb-stones, taking bath after bath in the water and ruffling their\r\nfeathers with delight. In a walled garden across the street a pair of\r\nblackbirds whistled among the almond trees.\r\n\r\nHastings swallowed the lump in his throat, for the song of the birds\r\nand the ripple of water in a Paris gutter brought back to him the sunny\r\nmeadows of Millbrook.\r\n\r\n“That’s a blackbird,” observed Miss Byng; “see him there on the bush\r\nwith pink blossoms. He’s all black except his bill, and that looks as\r\nif it had been dipped in an omelet, as some Frenchman says—”\r\n\r\n“Why, Susie!” said Mrs. Byng.\r\n\r\n“That garden belongs to a studio inhabited by two Americans,” continued\r\nthe girl serenely, “and I often see them pass. They seem to need a\r\ngreat many models, mostly young and feminine—”\r\n\r\n“Why, Susie!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they prefer painting that kind, but I don’t see why they\r\nshould invite five, with three more young gentlemen, and all get into\r\ntwo cabs and drive away singing. This street,” she continued, “is\r\ndull. There is nothing to see except the garden and a glimpse of the\r\nBoulevard Montparnasse through the rue de la Grande Chaumière. No one\r\never passes except a policeman. There is a convent on the corner.”\r\n\r\n“I thought it was a Jesuit College,” began Hastings, but was at once\r\noverwhelmed with a Baedecker description of the place, ending with, “On\r\none side stand the palatial hotels of Jean Paul Laurens and Guillaume\r\nBouguereau, and opposite, in the little Passage Stanislas, Carolus\r\nDuran paints the masterpieces which charm the world.”\r\n\r\nThe blackbird burst into a ripple of golden throaty notes, and from\r\nsome distant green spot in the city an unknown wild-bird answered with\r\na frenzy of liquid trills until the sparrows paused in their ablutions\r\nto look up with restless chirps.\r\n\r\nThen a butterfly came and sat on a cluster of heliotrope and waved\r\nhis crimson-banded wings in the hot sunshine. Hastings knew him for a\r\nfriend, and before his eyes there came a vision of tall mulleins and\r\nscented milkweed alive with painted wings, a vision of a white house\r\nand woodbine-covered piazza,—a glimpse of a man reading and a woman\r\nleaning over the pansy bed,—and his heart was full. He was startled a\r\nmoment later by Miss Byng.\r\n\r\n“I believe you are homesick!” Hastings blushed. Miss Byng looked at\r\nhim with a sympathetic sigh and continued: “Whenever I felt homesick\r\nat first I used to go with mamma and walk in the Luxembourg Gardens. I\r\ndon’t know why it is, but those old-fashioned gardens seemed to bring\r\nme nearer home than anything in this artificial city.”\r\n\r\n“But they are full of marble statues,” said Mrs. Byng mildly; “I don’t\r\nsee the resemblance myself.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the Luxembourg?” inquired Hastings after a silence.\r\n\r\n“Come with me to the gate,” said Miss Byng. He rose and followed her,\r\nand she pointed out the rue Vavin at the foot of the street.\r\n\r\n“You pass by the convent to the right,” she smiled; and Hastings went.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nThe Luxembourg was a blaze of flowers. He walked slowly through the\r\nlong avenues of trees, past mossy marbles and old-time columns, and\r\nthreading the grove by the bronze lion, came upon the tree-crowned\r\nterrace above the fountain. Below lay the basin shining in the\r\nsunlight. Flowering almonds encircled the terrace, and, in a greater\r\nspiral, groves of chestnuts wound in and out and down among the moist\r\nthickets by the western palace wing. At one end of the avenue of trees\r\nthe Observatory rose, its white domes piled up like an eastern mosque;\r\nat the other end stood the heavy palace, with every window-pane ablaze\r\nin the fierce sun of June.\r\n\r\nAround the fountain, children and white-capped nurses armed with bamboo\r\npoles were pushing toy boats, whose sails hung limp in the sunshine. A\r\ndark policeman, wearing red epaulettes and a dress sword, watched them\r\nfor a while and then went away to remonstrate with a young man who had\r\nunchained his dog. The dog was pleasantly occupied in rubbing grass and\r\ndirt into his back while his legs waved into the air.\r\n\r\nThe policeman pointed at the dog. He was speechless with indignation.\r\n\r\n“Well, Captain,” smiled the young fellow.\r\n\r\n“Well, Monsieur Student,” growled the policeman.\r\n\r\n“What do you come and complain to me for?”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t chain him I’ll take him,” shouted the policeman.\r\n\r\n“What’s that to me, mon capitaine?”\r\n\r\n“Wha—t! Isn’t that bull-dog yours?”\r\n\r\n“If it was, don’t you suppose I’d chain him?”\r\n\r\nThe officer glared for a moment in silence, then deciding that as he\r\nwas a student he was wicked, grabbed at the dog, who promptly dodged.\r\nAround and around the flower-beds they raced, and when the officer\r\ncame too near for comfort, the bull-dog cut across a flower-bed, which\r\nperhaps was not playing fair.\r\n\r\nThe young man was amused, and the dog also seemed to enjoy the exercise.\r\n\r\nThe policeman noticed this and decided to strike at the fountain-head\r\nof the evil. He stormed up to the student and said, “As the owner of\r\nthis public nuisance I arrest you!”\r\n\r\n“But,” objected the other, “I disclaim the dog.”\r\n\r\nThat was a poser. It was useless to attempt to catch the dog until\r\nthree gardeners lent a hand, but then the dog simply ran away and\r\ndisappeared in the rue de Medici.\r\n\r\nThe policeman shambled off to find consolation among the white-capped\r\nnurses, and the student, looking at his watch, stood up yawning. Then\r\ncatching sight of Hastings, he smiled and bowed. Hastings walked over\r\nto the marble, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Why, Clifford,” he said, “I didn’t recognize you.”\r\n\r\n“It’s my moustache,” sighed the other. “I sacrificed it to humour a\r\nwhim of—of—a friend. What do you think of my dog?”\r\n\r\n“Then he is yours?” cried Hastings.\r\n\r\n“Of course. It’s a pleasant change for him, this playing tag with\r\npolicemen, but he is known now and I’ll have to stop it. He’s gone\r\nhome. He always does when the gardeners take a hand. It’s a pity; he’s\r\nfond of rolling on lawns.” Then they chatted for a moment of Hastings’\r\nprospects, and Clifford politely offered to stand his sponsor at the\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\n“You see, old tabby, I mean Dr. Byram, told me about you before I\r\nmet you,” explained Clifford, “and Elliott and I will be glad to do\r\nanything we can.” Then looking at his watch again, he muttered, “I have\r\njust ten minutes to catch the Versailles train; au revoir,” and started\r\nto go, but catching sight of a girl advancing by the fountain, took off\r\nhis hat with a confused smile.\r\n\r\n“Why are you not at Versailles?” she said, with an almost imperceptible\r\nacknowledgment of Hastings’ presence.\r\n\r\n“I—I’m going,” murmured Clifford.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they faced each other, and then Clifford, very red,\r\nstammered, “With your permission I have the honour of presenting to you\r\nmy friend, Monsieur Hastings.”\r\n\r\nHastings bowed low. She smiled very sweetly, but there was something of\r\nmalice in the quiet inclination of her small Parisienne head.\r\n\r\n“I could have wished,” she said, “that Monsieur Clifford might spare me\r\nmore time when he brings with him so charming an American.”\r\n\r\n“Must—must I go, Valentine?” began Clifford.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” she replied.\r\n\r\nClifford took his leave with very bad grace, wincing, when she added,\r\n“And give my dearest love to Cécile!” As he disappeared in the rue\r\nd’Assas, the girl turned as if to go, but then suddenly remembering\r\nHastings, looked at him and shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Clifford is so perfectly harebrained,” she smiled, “it is\r\nembarrassing sometimes. You have heard, of course, all about his\r\nsuccess at the Salon?”\r\n\r\nHe looked puzzled and she noticed it.\r\n\r\n“You have been to the Salon, of course?”\r\n\r\n“Why, no,” he answered, “I only arrived in Paris three days ago.”\r\n\r\nShe seemed to pay little heed to his explanation, but continued:\r\n“Nobody imagined he had the energy to do anything good, but on\r\nvarnishing day the Salon was astonished by the entrance of Monsieur\r\nClifford, who strolled about as bland as you please with an orchid in\r\nhis buttonhole, and a beautiful picture on the line.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled to herself at the reminiscence, and looked at the fountain.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Bouguereau told me that Monsieur Julian was so astonished\r\nthat he only shook hands with Monsieur Clifford in a dazed manner, and\r\nactually forgot to pat him on the back! Fancy,” she continued with much\r\nmerriment, “fancy papa Julian forgetting to pat one on the back.”\r\n\r\nHastings, wondering at her acquaintance with the great Bouguereau,\r\nlooked at her with respect. “May I ask,” he said diffidently, “whether\r\nyou are a pupil of Bouguereau?”\r\n\r\n“I?” she said in some surprise. Then she looked at him curiously. Was\r\nhe permitting himself the liberty of joking on such short acquaintance?\r\n\r\nHis pleasant serious face questioned hers.\r\n\r\n“Tiens,” she thought, “what a droll man!”\r\n\r\n“You surely study art?” he said.\r\n\r\nShe leaned back on the crooked stick of her parasol, and looked at him.\r\n“Why do you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Because you speak as if you did.”\r\n\r\n“You are making fun of me,” she said, “and it is not good taste.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped, confused, as he coloured to the roots of his hair.\r\n\r\n“How long have you been in Paris?” she said at length.\r\n\r\n“Three days,” he replied gravely.\r\n\r\n“But—but—surely you are not a nouveau! You speak French too well!”\r\n\r\nThen after a pause, “Really are you a nouveau?”\r\n\r\n“I am,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the marble bench lately occupied by Clifford, and\r\ntilting her parasol over her small head looked at him.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it.”\r\n\r\nHe felt the compliment, and for a moment hesitated to declare himself\r\none of the despised. Then mustering up his courage, he told her how new\r\nand green he was, and all with a frankness which made her blue eyes\r\nopen very wide and her lips part in the sweetest of smiles.\r\n\r\n“You have never seen a studio?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“Nor a model?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“How funny,” she said solemnly. Then they both laughed.\r\n\r\n“And you,” he said, “have seen studios?”\r\n\r\n“Hundreds.”\r\n\r\n“And models?”\r\n\r\n“Millions.”\r\n\r\n“And you know Bouguereau?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and Henner, and Constant and Laurens, and Puvis de Chavannes and\r\nDagnan and Courtois, and—and all the rest of them!”\r\n\r\n“And yet you say you are not an artist.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon,” she said gravely, “did I say I was not?”\r\n\r\n“Won’t you tell me?” he hesitated.\r\n\r\nAt first she looked at him, shaking her head and smiling, then of a\r\nsudden her eyes fell and she began tracing figures with her parasol in\r\nthe gravel at her feet. Hastings had taken a place on the seat, and\r\nnow, with his elbows on his knees, sat watching the spray drifting\r\nabove the fountain jet. A small boy, dressed as a sailor, stood poking\r\nhis yacht and crying, “I won’t go home! I won’t go home!” His nurse\r\nraised her hands to Heaven.\r\n\r\n“Just like a little American boy,” thought Hastings, and a pang of\r\nhomesickness shot through him.\r\n\r\nPresently the nurse captured the boat, and the small boy stood at bay.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur René, when you decide to come here you may have your boat.”\r\n\r\nThe boy backed away scowling.\r\n\r\n“Give me my boat, I say,” he cried, “and don’t call me René, for my\r\nname’s Randall and you know it!”\r\n\r\n“Hello!” said Hastings,—“Randall?—that’s English.”\r\n\r\n“I am American,” announced the boy in perfectly good English, turning\r\nto look at Hastings, “and she’s such a fool she calls me René because\r\nmamma calls me Ranny—”\r\n\r\nHere he dodged the exasperated nurse and took up his station behind\r\nHastings, who laughed, and catching him around the waist lifted him\r\ninto his lap.\r\n\r\n“One of my countrymen,” he said to the girl beside him. He smiled while\r\nhe spoke, but there was a queer feeling in his throat.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you see the stars and stripes on my yacht?” demanded Randall.\r\nSure enough, the American colours hung limply under the nurse’s arm.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried the girl, “he is charming,” and impulsively stooped to kiss\r\nhim, but the infant Randall wriggled out of Hastings’ arms, and his\r\nnurse pounced upon him with an angry glance at the girl.\r\n\r\nShe reddened and then bit her lips as the nurse, with eyes still fixed\r\non her, dragged the child away and ostentatiously wiped his lips with\r\nher handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThen she stole a look at Hastings and bit her lip again.\r\n\r\n“What an ill-tempered woman!” he said. “In America, most nurses are\r\nflattered when people kiss their children.”\r\n\r\nFor an instant she tipped the parasol to hide her face, then closed it\r\nwith a snap and looked at him defiantly.\r\n\r\n“Do you think it strange that she objected?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” he said in surprise.\r\n\r\nAgain she looked at him with quick searching eyes.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were clear and bright, and he smiled back, repeating, “Why\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“You _are_ droll,” she murmured, bending her head.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\nBut she made no answer, and sat silent, tracing curves and circles in\r\nthe dust with her parasol. After a while he said—“I am glad to see\r\nthat young people have so much liberty here. I understood that the\r\nFrench were not at all like us. You know in America—or at least where\r\nI live in Milbrook, girls have every liberty,—go out alone and receive\r\ntheir friends alone, and I was afraid I should miss it here. But I see\r\nhow it is now, and I am glad I was mistaken.”\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to his and kept them there.\r\n\r\nHe continued pleasantly—“Since I have sat here I have seen a lot of\r\npretty girls walking alone on the terrace there,—and then _you_ are\r\nalone too. Tell me, for I do not know French customs,—do you have the\r\nliberty of going to the theatre without a chaperone?”\r\n\r\nFor a long time she studied his face, and then with a trembling smile\r\nsaid, “Why do you ask me?”\r\n\r\n“Because you must know, of course,” he said gaily.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she replied indifferently, “I know.”\r\n\r\nHe waited for an answer, but getting none, decided that perhaps she had\r\nmisunderstood him.\r\n\r\n“I hope you don’t think I mean to presume on our short acquaintance,”\r\nhe began,—“in fact it is very odd but I don’t know your name. When Mr.\r\nClifford presented me he only mentioned mine. Is that the custom in\r\nFrance?”\r\n\r\n“It is the custom in the Latin Quarter,” she said with a queer light in\r\nher eyes. Then suddenly she began talking almost feverishly.\r\n\r\n“You must know, Monsieur Hastings, that we are all _un peu sans gêne_\r\nhere in the Latin Quarter. We are very Bohemian, and etiquette and\r\nceremony are out of place. It was for that Monsieur Clifford presented\r\nyou to me with small ceremony, and left us together with less,—only\r\nfor that, and I am his friend, and I have many friends in the Latin\r\nQuarter, and we all know each other very well—and I am not studying\r\nart, but—but—”\r\n\r\n“But what?” he said, bewildered.\r\n\r\n“I shall not tell you,—it is a secret,” she said with an uncertain\r\nsmile. On both cheeks a pink spot was burning, and her eyes were very\r\nbright.\r\n\r\nThen in a moment her face fell. “Do you know Monsieur Clifford very\r\nintimately?”\r\n\r\n“Not very.”\r\n\r\nAfter a while she turned to him, grave and a little pale.\r\n\r\n“My name is Valentine—Valentine Tissot. Might—might I ask a service\r\nof you on such very short acquaintance?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he cried, “I should be honoured.”\r\n\r\n“It is only this,” she said gently, “it is not much. Promise me not to\r\nspeak to Monsieur Clifford about me. Promise me that you will speak to\r\nno one about me.”\r\n\r\n“I promise,” he said, greatly puzzled.\r\n\r\nShe laughed nervously. “I wish to remain a mystery. It is a caprice.”\r\n\r\n“But,” he began, “I had wished, I had hoped that you might give\r\nMonsieur Clifford permission to bring me, to present me at your house.”\r\n\r\n“My—my house!” she repeated.\r\n\r\n“I mean, where you live, in fact, to present me to your family.”\r\n\r\nThe change in the girl’s face shocked him.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” he cried, “I have hurt you.”\r\n\r\nAnd as quick as a flash she understood him because she was a woman.\r\n\r\n“My parents are dead,” she said.\r\n\r\nPresently he began again, very gently.\r\n\r\n“Would it displease you if I beg you to receive me? It is the custom?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot,” she answered. Then glancing up at him, “I am sorry; I\r\nshould like to; but believe me. I cannot.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed seriously and looked vaguely uneasy.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t because I don’t wish to. I—I like you; you are very kind to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Kind?” he cried, surprised and puzzled.\r\n\r\n“I like you,” she said slowly, “and we will see each other sometimes if\r\nyou will.”\r\n\r\n“At friends’ houses.”\r\n\r\n“No, not at friends’ houses.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“Here,” she said with defiant eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why,” he cried, “in Paris you are much more liberal in your views than\r\nwe are.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him curiously.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we are very Bohemian.”\r\n\r\n“I think it is charming,” he declared.\r\n\r\n“You see, we shall be in the best of society,” she ventured timidly,\r\nwith a pretty gesture toward the statues of the dead queens, ranged in\r\nstately ranks above the terrace.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, delighted, and she brightened at the success of her\r\ninnocent little pleasantry.\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” she smiled, “I shall be well chaperoned, because you see\r\nwe are under the protection of the gods themselves; look, there are\r\nApollo, and Juno, and Venus, on their pedestals,” counting them on her\r\nsmall gloved fingers, “and Ceres, Hercules, and—but I can’t make out—”\r\n\r\nHastings turned to look up at the winged god under whose shadow they\r\nwere seated.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s Love,” he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n“There is a nouveau here,” drawled Laffat, leaning around his easel and\r\naddressing his friend Bowles, “there is a nouveau here who is so tender\r\nand green and appetizing that Heaven help him if he should fall into a\r\nsalad bowl.”\r\n\r\n“Hayseed?” inquired Bowles, plastering in a background with a broken\r\npalette-knife and squinting at the effect with approval.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Squeedunk or Oshkosh, and how he ever grew up among the daisies\r\nand escaped the cows, Heaven alone knows!”\r\n\r\nBowles rubbed his thumb across the outlines of his study to “throw in a\r\nlittle atmosphere,” as he said, glared at the model, pulled at his pipe\r\nand finding it out struck a match on his neighbour’s back to relight it.\r\n\r\n“His name,” continued Laffat, hurling a bit of bread at the hat-rack,\r\n“his name is Hastings. He _is_ a berry. He knows no more about the\r\nworld,”—and here Mr. Laffat’s face spoke volumes for his own knowledge\r\nof that planet,—“than a maiden cat on its first moonlight stroll.”\r\n\r\nBowles now having succeeded in lighting his pipe, repeated the thumb\r\ntouch on the other edge of the study and said, “Ah!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued his friend, “and would you imagine it, he seems to\r\nthink that everything here goes on as it does in his d——d little\r\nbackwoods ranch at home; talks about the pretty girls who walk alone\r\nin the street; says how sensible it is; and how French parents are\r\nmisrepresented in America; says that for his part he finds French\r\ngirls,—and he confessed to only knowing one,—as jolly as American\r\ngirls. I tried to set him right, tried to give him a pointer as to what\r\nsort of ladies walk about alone or with students, and he was either too\r\nstupid or too innocent to catch on. Then I gave it to him straight, and\r\nhe said I was a vile-minded fool and marched off.”\r\n\r\n“Did you assist him with your shoe?” inquired Bowles, languidly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n“Well, no.”\r\n\r\n“He called you a vile-minded fool.”\r\n\r\n“He was correct,” said Clifford from his easel in front.\r\n\r\n“What—what do you mean?” demanded Laffat, turning red.\r\n\r\n“_That_,” replied Clifford.\r\n\r\n“Who spoke to you? Is this your business?” sneered Bowles, but nearly\r\nlost his balance as Clifford swung about and eyed him.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said slowly, “it’s my business.”\r\n\r\nNo one spoke for some time.\r\n\r\nThen Clifford sang out, “I say, Hastings!”\r\n\r\nAnd when Hastings left his easel and came around, he nodded toward the\r\nastonished Laffat.\r\n\r\n“This man has been disagreeable to you, and I want to tell you that\r\nany time you feel inclined to kick him, why, I will hold the other\r\ncreature.”\r\n\r\nHastings, embarrassed, said, “Why no, I don’t agree with his ideas,\r\nnothing more.”\r\n\r\nClifford said “Naturally,” and slipping his arm through Hastings’,\r\nstrolled about with him, and introduced him to several of his own\r\nfriends, at which all the nouveaux opened their eyes with envy, and the\r\nstudio were given to understand that Hastings, although prepared to\r\ndo menial work as the latest nouveau, was already within the charmed\r\ncircle of the old, respected and feared, the truly great.\r\n\r\nThe rest finished, the model resumed his place, and work went on in a\r\nchorus of songs and yells and every ear-splitting noise which the art\r\nstudent utters when studying the beautiful.\r\n\r\nFive o’clock struck,—the model yawned, stretched and climbed into\r\nhis trousers, and the noisy contents of six studios crowded through\r\nthe hall and down into the street. Ten minutes later, Hastings found\r\nhimself on top of a Montrouge tram, and shortly afterward was joined by\r\nClifford.\r\n\r\nThey climbed down at the rue Gay Lussac.\r\n\r\n“I always stop here,” observed Clifford, “I like the walk through the\r\nLuxembourg.”\r\n\r\n“By the way,” said Hastings, “how can I call on you when I don’t know\r\nwhere you live?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I live opposite you.”\r\n\r\n“What—the studio in the garden where the almond trees are and the\r\nblackbirds—”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Clifford. “I’m with my friend Elliott.”\r\n\r\nHastings thought of the description of the two American artists which\r\nhe had heard from Miss Susie Byng, and looked blank.\r\n\r\nClifford continued, “Perhaps you had better let me know when you think\r\nof coming so,—so that I will be sure to—to be there,” he ended rather\r\nlamely.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t care to meet any of your model friends there,” said\r\nHastings, smiling. “You know—my ideas are rather straitlaced,—I\r\nsuppose you would say, Puritanical. I shouldn’t enjoy it and wouldn’t\r\nknow how to behave.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I understand,” said Clifford, but added with great\r\ncordiality,—“I’m sure we’ll be friends although you may not approve\r\nof me and my set, but you will like Severn and Selby because—because,\r\nwell, they are like yourself, old chap.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he continued, “There is something I want to speak about.\r\nYou see, when I introduced you, last week, in the Luxembourg, to\r\nValentine—”\r\n\r\n“Not a word!” cried Hastings, smiling; “you must not tell me a word of\r\nher!”\r\n\r\n“Why—”\r\n\r\n“No—not a word!” he said gaily. “I insist,—promise me upon your\r\nhonour you will not speak of her until I give you permission; promise!”\r\n\r\n“I promise,” said Clifford, amazed.\r\n\r\n“She is a charming girl,—we had such a delightful chat after you left,\r\nand I thank you for presenting me, but not another word about her until\r\nI give you permission.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” murmured Clifford.\r\n\r\n“Remember your promise,” he smiled, as he turned into his gateway.\r\n\r\nClifford strolled across the street and, traversing the ivy-covered\r\nalley, entered his garden.\r\n\r\nHe felt for his studio key, muttering, “I wonder—I wonder,—but of\r\ncourse he doesn’t!”\r\n\r\nHe entered the hallway, and fitting the key into the door, stood\r\nstaring at the two cards tacked over the panels.\r\n\r\n                      +---------------------------+\r\n                      |     FOXHALL CLIFFORD      |\r\n                      +---------------------------+\r\n\r\n                      +---------------------------+\r\n                      |  RICHARD OSBORNE ELLIOTT  |\r\n                      +---------------------------+\r\n\r\n“Why the devil doesn’t he want me to speak of her?”\r\n\r\nHe opened the door, and, discouraging the caresses of two brindle\r\nbull-dogs, sank down on the sofa.\r\n\r\nElliott sat smoking and sketching with a piece of charcoal by the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n“Hello,” he said without looking around.\r\n\r\nClifford gazed absently at the back of his head, murmuring, “I’m\r\nafraid, I’m afraid that man is too innocent. I say, Elliott,” he said,\r\nat last, “Hastings,—you know the chap that old Tabby Byram came around\r\nhere to tell us about—the day you had to hide Colette in the armoire—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, what’s up?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing. He’s a brick.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Elliott, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think so?” demanded Clifford.\r\n\r\n“Why yes, but he is going to have a tough time when some of his\r\nillusions are dispelled.”\r\n\r\n“More shame to those who dispel ’em!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,—wait until he comes to pay his call on us, unexpectedly, of\r\ncourse—”\r\n\r\nClifford looked virtuous and lighted a cigar.\r\n\r\n“I was just going to say,” he observed, “that I have asked him not to\r\ncome without letting us know, so I can postpone any orgie you may have\r\nintended—”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried Elliott indignantly, “I suppose you put it to him in that\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly,” grinned Clifford. Then more seriously, “I don’t want\r\nanything to occur here to bother him. He’s a brick, and it’s a pity we\r\ncan’t be more like him.”\r\n\r\n“I am,” observed Elliott complacently, “only living with you—”\r\n\r\n“Listen!” cried the other. “I have managed to put my foot in it in\r\ngreat style. Do you know what I’ve done? Well—the first time I met him\r\nin the street,—or rather, it was in the Luxembourg, I introduced him\r\nto Valentine!”\r\n\r\n“Did he object?”\r\n\r\n“Believe me,” said Clifford, solemnly, “this rustic Hastings has no\r\nmore idea that Valentine is—is—in fact is Valentine, than he has\r\nthat he himself is a beautiful example of moral decency in a Quarter\r\nwhere morals are as rare as elephants. I heard enough in a conversation\r\nbetween that blackguard Loffat and the little immoral eruption, Bowles,\r\nto open my eyes. I tell you Hastings is a trump! He’s a healthy,\r\nclean-minded young fellow, bred in a small country village, brought up\r\nwith the idea that saloons are way-stations to hell—and as for women—”\r\n\r\n“Well?” demanded Elliott.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Clifford, “his idea of the dangerous woman is probably a\r\npainted Jezabel.”\r\n\r\n“Probably,” replied the other.\r\n\r\n“He’s a trump!” said Clifford, “and if he swears the world is as good\r\nand pure as his own heart, I’ll swear he’s right.”\r\n\r\nElliott rubbed his charcoal on his file to get a point and turned to\r\nhis sketch saying, “He will never hear any pessimism from Richard\r\nOsborne E.”\r\n\r\n“He’s a lesson to me,” said Clifford. Then he unfolded a small perfumed\r\nnote, written on rose-coloured paper, which had been lying on the table\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nHe read it, smiled, whistled a bar or two from “Miss Helyett,” and\r\nsat down to answer it on his best cream-laid note-paper. When it was\r\nwritten and sealed, he picked up his stick and marched up and down the\r\nstudio two or three times, whistling.\r\n\r\n“Going out?” inquired the other, without turning.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, but lingered a moment over Elliott’s shoulder, watching\r\nhim pick out the lights in his sketch with a bit of bread.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow is Sunday,” he observed after a moment’s silence.\r\n\r\n“Well?” inquired Elliott.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen Colette?”\r\n\r\n“No, I will to-night. She and Rowden and Jacqueline are coming to\r\nBoulant’s. I suppose you and Cécile will be there?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no,” replied Clifford. “Cécile dines at home to-night, and I—I\r\nhad an idea of going to Mignon’s.”\r\n\r\nElliott looked at him with disapproval.\r\n\r\n“You can make all the arrangements for La Roche without me,” he\r\ncontinued, avoiding Elliott’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“What are you up to now?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” protested Clifford.\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell me,” replied his chum, with scorn; “fellows don’t rush off\r\nto Mignon’s when the set dine at Boulant’s. Who is it now?—but no,\r\nI won’t ask that,—what’s the use!” Then he lifted up his voice in\r\ncomplaint and beat upon the table with his pipe. “What’s the use of\r\never trying to keep track of you? What will Cécile say,—oh, yes, what\r\nwill she say? It’s a pity you can’t be constant two months, yes, by\r\nJove! and the Quarter is indulgent, but you abuse its good nature and\r\nmine too!”\r\n\r\nPresently he arose, and jamming his hat on his head, marched to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“Heaven alone knows why any one puts up with your antics, but they all\r\ndo and so do I. If I were Cécile or any of the other pretty fools after\r\nwhom you have toddled and will, in all human probabilities, continue\r\nto toddle, I say, if I were Cécile I’d spank you! Now I’m going to\r\nBoulant’s, and as usual I shall make excuses for you and arrange the\r\naffair, and I don’t care a continental where you are going, but, by the\r\nskull of the studio skeleton! if you don’t turn up to-morrow with your\r\nsketching-kit under one arm and Cécile under the other,—if you don’t\r\nturn up in good shape, I’m done with you, and the rest can think what\r\nthey please. Good-night.”\r\n\r\nClifford said good-night with as pleasant a smile as he could muster,\r\nand then sat down with his eyes on the door. He took out his watch and\r\ngave Elliott ten minutes to vanish, then rang the concierge’s call,\r\nmurmuring, “Oh dear, oh dear, why the devil do I do it?”\r\n\r\n“Alfred,” he said, as that gimlet-eyed person answered the call, “make\r\nyourself clean and proper, Alfred, and replace your sabots with a\r\npair of shoes. Then put on your best hat and take this letter to the\r\nbig white house in the Rue de Dragon. There is no answer, _mon petit_\r\nAlfred.”\r\n\r\nThe concierge departed with a snort in which unwillingness for the\r\nerrand and affection for M. Clifford were blended. Then with great\r\ncare the young fellow arrayed himself in all the beauties of his\r\nand Elliott’s wardrobe. He took his time about it, and occasionally\r\ninterrupted his toilet to play his banjo or make pleasing diversion\r\nfor the bull-dogs by gambling about on all fours. “I’ve got two hours\r\nbefore me,” he thought, and borrowed a pair of Elliott’s silken\r\nfoot-gear, with which he and the dogs played ball until he decided to\r\nput them on. Then he lighted a cigarette and inspected his dress-coat.\r\nWhen he had emptied it of four handkerchiefs, a fan, and a pair of\r\ncrumpled gloves as long as his arm, he decided it was not suited to\r\nadd _éclat_ to his charms and cast about in his mind for a substitute.\r\nElliott was too thin, and, anyway, his coats were now under lock and\r\nkey. Rowden probably was as badly off as himself. Hastings! Hastings\r\nwas the man! But when he threw on a smoking-jacket and sauntered over\r\nto Hastings’ house, he was informed that he had been gone over an hour.\r\n\r\n“Now, where in the name of all that’s reasonable could he have gone!”\r\nmuttered Clifford, looking down the street.\r\n\r\nThe maid didn’t know, so he bestowed upon her a fascinating smile and\r\nlounged back to the studio.\r\n\r\nHastings was not far away. The Luxembourg is within five minutes’ walk\r\nof the rue Notre Dame des Champs, and there he sat under the shadow\r\nof a winged god, and there he had sat for an hour, poking holes in\r\nthe dust and watching the steps which lead from the northern terrace\r\nto the fountain. The sun hung, a purple globe, above the misty hills\r\nof Meudon. Long streamers of clouds touched with rose swept low on\r\nthe western sky, and the dome of the distant Invalides burned like an\r\nopal through the haze. Behind the Palace the smoke from a high chimney\r\nmounted straight into the air, purple until it crossed the sun, where\r\nit changed to a bar of smouldering fire. High above the darkening\r\nfoliage of the chestnuts the twin towers of St. Sulpice rose, an\r\never-deepening silhouette.\r\n\r\nA sleepy blackbird was carolling in some near thicket, and pigeons\r\npassed and repassed with the whisper of soft winds in their wings. The\r\nlight on the Palace windows had died away, and the dome of the Pantheon\r\nswam aglow above the northern terrace, a fiery Valhalla in the sky;\r\nwhile below in grim array, along the terrace ranged, the marble ranks\r\nof queens looked out into the west.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the long walk by the northern façade of the Palace\r\ncame the noise of omnibuses and the cries of the street. Hastings\r\nlooked at the Palace clock. Six, and as his own watch agreed with it,\r\nhe fell to poking holes in the gravel again. A constant stream of\r\npeople passed between the Odéon and the fountain. Priests in black,\r\nwith silver-buckled shoes; line soldiers, slouchy and rakish; neat\r\ngirls without hats bearing milliners’ boxes, students with black\r\nportfolios and high hats, students with bérets and big canes, nervous,\r\nquick-stepping officers, symphonies in turquoise and silver; ponderous\r\njangling cavalrymen all over dust, pastry cooks’ boys skipping along\r\nwith utter disregard for the safety of the basket balanced on the\r\nimpish head, and then the lean outcast, the shambling Paris tramp,\r\nslouching with shoulders bent and little eye furtively scanning the\r\nground for smokers’ refuse;—all these moved in a steady stream across\r\nthe fountain circle and out into the city by the Odeon, whose long\r\narcades were now beginning to flicker with gas-jets. The melancholy\r\nbells of St Sulpice struck the hour and the clock-tower of the Palace\r\nlighted up. Then hurried steps sounded across the gravel and Hastings\r\nraised his head.\r\n\r\n“How late you are,” he said, but his voice was hoarse and only his\r\nflushed face told how long had seemed the waiting.\r\n\r\nShe said, “I was kept—indeed, I was so much annoyed—and—and I may\r\nonly stay a moment.”\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside him, casting a furtive glance over her shoulder at\r\nthe god upon his pedestal.\r\n\r\n“What a nuisance, that intruding cupid still there?”\r\n\r\n“Wings and arrows too,” said Hastings, unheeding her motion to be\r\nseated.\r\n\r\n“Wings,” she murmured, “oh, yes—to fly away with when he’s tired of\r\nhis play. Of course it was a man who conceived the idea of wings,\r\notherwise Cupid would have been insupportable.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, it’s what men think.”\r\n\r\n“And women?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said, with a toss of her small head, “I really forget what we\r\nwere speaking of.”\r\n\r\n“We were speaking of love,” said Hastings.\r\n\r\n“_I_ was not,” said the girl. Then looking up at the marble god, “I\r\ndon’t care for this one at all. I don’t believe he knows how to shoot\r\nhis arrows—no, indeed, he is a coward;—he creeps up like an assassin\r\nin the twilight. I don’t approve of cowardice,” she announced, and\r\nturned her back on the statue.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Hastings quietly, “that he does shoot fairly—yes, and\r\neven gives one warning.”\r\n\r\n“Is it your experience, Monsieur Hastings?”\r\n\r\nHe looked straight into her eyes and said, “He is warning me.”\r\n\r\n“Heed the warning then,” she cried, with a nervous laugh. As she spoke\r\nshe stripped off her gloves, and then carefully proceeded to draw them\r\non again. When this was accomplished she glanced at the Palace clock,\r\nsaying, “Oh dear, how late it is!” furled her umbrella, then unfurled\r\nit, and finally looked at him.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, “I shall not heed his warning.”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear,” she sighed again, “still talking about that tiresome\r\nstatue!” Then stealing a glance at his face, “I suppose—I suppose you\r\nare in love.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” he muttered, “I suppose I am.”\r\n\r\nShe raised her head with a quick gesture. “You seem delighted at the\r\nidea,” she said, but bit her lip and trembled as his eyes met hers.\r\nThen sudden fear came over her and she sprang up, staring into the\r\ngathering shadows.\r\n\r\n“Are you cold?” he said.\r\n\r\nBut she only answered, “Oh dear, oh dear, it is late—so late! I must\r\ngo—good-night.”\r\n\r\nShe gave him her gloved hand a moment and then withdrew it with a start.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he insisted. “Are you frightened?”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him strangely.\r\n\r\n“No—no—not frightened,—you are very good to me—”\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” he burst out, “what do you mean by saying I’m good to you?\r\nThat’s at least the third time, and I don’t understand!”\r\n\r\nThe sound of a drum from the guard-house at the palace cut him short.\r\n“Listen,” she whispered, “they are going to close. It’s late, oh, so\r\nlate!”\r\n\r\nThe rolling of the drum came nearer and nearer, and then the silhouette\r\nof the drummer cut the sky above the eastern terrace. The fading light\r\nlingered a moment on his belt and bayonet, then he passed into the\r\nshadows, drumming the echoes awake. The roll became fainter along\r\nthe eastern terrace, then grew and grew and rattled with increasing\r\nsharpness when he passed the avenue by the bronze lion and turned down\r\nthe western terrace walk. Louder and louder the drum sounded, and the\r\nechoes struck back the notes from the grey palace wall; and now the\r\ndrummer loomed up before them—his red trousers a dull spot in the\r\ngathering gloom, the brass of his drum and bayonet touched with a pale\r\nspark, his epaulettes tossing on his shoulders. He passed leaving the\r\ncrash of the drum in their ears, and far into the alley of trees they\r\nsaw his little tin cup shining on his haversack. Then the sentinels\r\nbegan the monotonous cry: “On ferme! on ferme!” and the bugle blew from\r\nthe barracks in the rue de Tournon.\r\n\r\n“On ferme! on ferme!”\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” she whispered, “I must return alone to-night.”\r\n\r\nHe watched her until she reached the northern terrace, and then sat\r\ndown on the marble seat until a hand on his shoulder and a glimmer of\r\nbayonets warned him away.\r\n\r\nShe passed on through the grove, and turning into the rue de Medici,\r\ntraversed it to the Boulevard. At the corner she bought a bunch of\r\nviolets and walked on along the Boulevard to the rue des Écoles. A\r\ncab was drawn up before Boulant’s, and a pretty girl aided by Elliott\r\njumped out.\r\n\r\n“Valentine!” cried the girl, “come with us!”\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” she said, stopping a moment—“I have a rendezvous at\r\nMignon’s.”\r\n\r\n“Not Victor?” cried the girl, laughing, but she passed with a little\r\nshiver, nodding good-night, then turning into the Boulevard St.\r\nGermain, she walked a tittle faster to escape a gay party sitting\r\nbefore the Café Cluny who called to her to join them. At the door of\r\nthe Restaurant Mignon stood a coal-black negro in buttons. He took off\r\nhis peaked cap as she mounted the carpeted stairs.\r\n\r\n“Send Eugene to me,” she said at the office, and passing through\r\nthe hallway to the right of the dining-room stopped before a row of\r\npanelled doors. A waiter passed and she repeated her demand for Eugene,\r\nwho presently appeared, noiselessly skipping, and bowed murmuring,\r\n“Madame.”\r\n\r\n“Who is here?”\r\n\r\n“No one in the cabinets, madame; in the half Madame Madelon and\r\nMonsieur Gay, Monsieur de Clamart, Monsieur Clisson, Madame Marie and\r\ntheir set.” Then he looked around and bowing again murmured, “Monsieur\r\nawaits madame since half an hour,” and he knocked at one of the\r\npanelled doors bearing the number six.\r\n\r\nClifford opened the door and the girl entered.\r\n\r\nThe garçon bowed her in, and whispering, “Will Monsieur have the\r\ngoodness to ring?” vanished.\r\n\r\nHe helped her off with her jacket and took her hat and umbrella. When\r\nshe was seated at the little table with Clifford opposite she smiled\r\nand leaned forward on both elbows looking him in the face.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“Waiting,” he replied, in accents of adoration.\r\n\r\nFor an instant she turned and examined herself in the glass. The wide\r\nblue eyes, the curling hair, the straight nose and short curled lip\r\nflashed in the mirror an instant only, and then its depths reflected\r\nher pretty neck and back. “Thus do I turn my back on vanity,” she said,\r\nand then leaning forward again, “What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“Waiting for you,” repeated Clifford, slightly troubled.\r\n\r\n“And Cécile.”\r\n\r\n“Now don’t, Valentine—”\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” she said calmly, “I dislike your conduct?”\r\n\r\nHe was a little disconcerted, and rang for Eugene to cover his\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nThe soup was bisque, and the wine Pommery, and the courses followed\r\neach other with the usual regularity until Eugene brought coffee, and\r\nthere was nothing left on the table but a small silver lamp.\r\n\r\n“Valentine,” said Clifford, after having obtained permission to smoke,\r\n“is it the Vaudeville or the Eldorado—or both, or the Nouveau Cirque,\r\nor—”\r\n\r\n“It is here,” said Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, greatly flattered, “I’m afraid I couldn’t amuse you—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, you are funnier than the Eldorado.”\r\n\r\n“Now see here, don’t guy me, Valentine. You always do, and, and,—you\r\nknow what they say,—a good laugh kills—”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Er—er—love and all that.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed until her eyes were moist with tears. “Tiens,” she cried,\r\n“he is dead, then!”\r\n\r\nClifford eyed her with growing alarm.\r\n\r\n“Do you know why I came?” she said.\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied uneasily, “I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“How long have you made love to me?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” he admitted, somewhat startled,—“I should say,—for about a\r\nyear.”\r\n\r\n“It is a year, I think. Are you not tired?”\r\n\r\nHe did not answer.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know that I like you too well to—to ever fall in love with\r\nyou?” she said. “Don’t you know that we are too good comrades,—too old\r\nfriends for that? And were we not,—do you think that I do not know\r\nyour history, Monsieur Clifford?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be—don’t be so sarcastic,” he urged; “don’t be unkind,\r\nValentine.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not. I’m kind. I’m very kind,—to you and to Cécile.”\r\n\r\n“Cécile is tired of me.”\r\n\r\n“I hope she is,” said the girl, “for she deserves a better fate. Tiens,\r\ndo you know your reputation in the Quarter? Of the inconstant, the most\r\ninconstant,—utterly incorrigible and no more serious than a gnat on a\r\nsummer night. Poor Cécile!”\r\n\r\nClifford looked so uncomfortable that she spoke more kindly.\r\n\r\n“I like you. You know that. Everybody does. You are a spoiled child\r\nhere. Everything is permitted you and every one makes allowance, but\r\nevery one cannot be a victim to caprice.”\r\n\r\n“Caprice!” he cried. “By Jove, if the girls of the Latin Quarter are\r\nnot capricious—”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,—never mind about that! You must not sit in judgment—you\r\nof all men. Why are you here to-night? Oh,” she cried, “I will tell\r\nyou why! Monsieur receives a little note; he sends a little answer; he\r\ndresses in his conquering raiment—”\r\n\r\n“I don’t,” said Clifford, very red.\r\n\r\n“You do, and it becomes you,” she retorted with a faint smile. Then\r\nagain, very quietly, “I am in your power, but I know I am in the power\r\nof a friend. I have come to acknowledge it to you here,—and it is\r\nbecause of that that I am here to beg of you—a—a favour.”\r\n\r\nClifford opened his eyes, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n“I am in—great distress of mind. It is Monsieur Hastings.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Clifford, in some astonishment.\r\n\r\n“I want to ask you,” she continued in a low voice, “I want to ask you\r\nto—to—in case you should speak of me before him,—not to say,—not to\r\nsay,—”\r\n\r\n“I shall not speak of you to him,” he said quietly.\r\n\r\n“Can—can you prevent others?”\r\n\r\n“I might if I was present. May I ask why?”\r\n\r\n“That is not fair,” she murmured; “you know how—how he considers\r\nme,—as he considers every woman. You know how different he is from\r\nyou and the rest. I have never seen a man,—such a man as Monsieur\r\nHastings.”\r\n\r\nHe let his cigarette go out unnoticed.\r\n\r\n“I am almost afraid of him—afraid he should know—what we all are in\r\nthe Quarter. Oh, I do not wish him to know! I do not wish him to—to\r\nturn from me—to cease from speaking to me as he does! You—you and the\r\nrest cannot know what it has been to me. I could not believe him,—I\r\ncould not believe he was so good and—and noble. I do not wish him\r\nto know—so soon. He will find out—sooner or later, he will find\r\nout for himself, and then he will turn away from me. Why!” she cried\r\npassionately, “why should he turn from me and not from _you_?”\r\n\r\nClifford, much embarrassed, eyed his cigarette.\r\n\r\nThe girl rose, very white. “He is your friend—you have a right to warn\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“He is my friend,” he said at length.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other in silence.\r\n\r\nThen she cried, “By all that I hold to me most sacred, you need not\r\nwarn him!”\r\n\r\n“I shall trust your word,” he said pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nThe month passed quickly for Hastings, and left few definite\r\nimpressions after it. It did leave some, however. One was a painful\r\nimpression of meeting Mr. Bladen on the Boulevard des Capucines in\r\ncompany with a very pronounced young person whose laugh dismayed him,\r\nand when at last he escaped from the café where Mr. Bladen had hauled\r\nhim to join them in a _bock_ he felt as if the whole boulevard was\r\nlooking at him, and judging him by his company. Later, an instinctive\r\nconviction regarding the young person with Mr. Bladen sent the hot\r\nblood into his cheek, and he returned to the pension in such a\r\nmiserable state of mind that Miss Byng was alarmed and advised him to\r\nconquer his homesickness at once.\r\n\r\nAnother impression was equally vivid. One Saturday morning, feeling\r\nlonely, his wanderings about the city brought him to the Gare St.\r\nLazare. It was early for breakfast, but he entered the Hôtel Terminus\r\nand took a table near the window. As he wheeled about to give his\r\norder, a man passing rapidly along the aisle collided with his head,\r\nand looking up to receive the expected apology, he was met instead by\r\na slap on the shoulder and a hearty, “What the deuce are you doing\r\nhere, old chap?” It was Rowden, who seized him and told him to come\r\nalong. So, mildly protesting, he was ushered into a private dining-room\r\nwhere Clifford, rather red, jumped up from the table and welcomed\r\nhim with a startled air which was softened by the unaffected glee\r\nof Rowden and the extreme courtesy of Elliott. The latter presented\r\nhim to three bewitching girls who welcomed him so charmingly and\r\nseconded Rowden in his demand that Hastings should make one of the\r\nparty, that he consented at once. While Elliott briefly outlined the\r\nprojected excursion to La Roche, Hastings delightedly ate his omelet,\r\nand returned the smiles of encouragement from Cécile and Colette and\r\nJacqueline. Meantime Clifford in a bland whisper was telling Rowden\r\nwhat an ass he was. Poor Rowden looked miserable until Elliott,\r\ndivining how affairs were turning, frowned on Clifford and found a\r\nmoment to let Rowden know that they were all going to make the best of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“You shut up,” he observed to Clifford, “it’s fate, and that settles\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“It’s Rowden, and that settles it,” murmured Clifford, concealing a\r\ngrin. For after all he was not Hastings’ wet nurse. So it came about\r\nthat the train which left the Gare St. Lazare at 9.15 a.m. stopped a\r\nmoment in its career towards Havre and deposited at the red-roofed\r\nstation of La Roche a merry party, armed with sunshades, trout-rods,\r\nand one cane, carried by the non-combatant, Hastings. Then, when they\r\nhad established their camp in a grove of sycamores which bordered\r\nthe little river Ept, Clifford, the acknowledged master of all that\r\npertained to sportsmanship, took command.\r\n\r\n“You, Rowden,” he said, “divide your flies with Elliott and keep an eye\r\non him or else he’ll be trying to put on a float and sinker. Prevent\r\nhim by force from grubbing about for worms.”\r\n\r\nElliott protested, but was forced to smile in the general laugh.\r\n\r\n“You make me ill,” he asserted; “do you think this is my first trout?”\r\n\r\n“I shall be delighted to see your first trout,” said Clifford, and\r\ndodging a fly hook, hurled with intent to hit, proceeded to sort and\r\nequip three slender rods destined to bring joy and fish to Cécile,\r\nColette, and Jacqueline. With perfect gravity he ornamented each line\r\nwith four split shot, a small hook, and a brilliant quill float.\r\n\r\n“_I_ shall never touch the worms,” announced Cécile with a shudder.\r\n\r\nJacqueline and Colette hastened to sustain her, and Hastings pleasantly\r\noffered to act in the capacity of general baiter and taker-off of fish.\r\nBut Cécile, doubtless fascinated by the gaudy flies in Clifford’s book,\r\ndecided to accept lessons from him in the true art, and presently\r\ndisappeared up the Ept with Clifford in tow.\r\n\r\nElliott looked doubtfully at Colette.\r\n\r\n“I prefer gudgeons,” said that damsel with decision, “and you and\r\nMonsieur Rowden may go away when you please; may they not, Jacqueline?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” responded Jacqueline.\r\n\r\nElliott, undecided, examined his rod and reel.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got your reel on wrong side up,” observed Rowden.\r\n\r\nElliott wavered, and stole a glance at Colette.\r\n\r\n“I—I—have almost decided to—er—not to flip the flies about just\r\nnow,” he began. “There’s the pole that Cécile left—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t call it a pole,” corrected Rowden.\r\n\r\n“_Rod_, then,” continued Elliott, and started off in the wake of the\r\ntwo girls, but was promptly collared by Rowden.\r\n\r\n“No, you don’t! Fancy a man fishing with a float and sinker when he has\r\na fly rod in his hand! You come along!”\r\n\r\nWhere the placid little Ept flows down between its thickets to the\r\nSeine, a grassy bank shadows the haunt of the gudgeon, and on this bank\r\nsat Colette and Jacqueline and chattered and laughed and watched the\r\nswerving of the scarlet quills, while Hastings, his hat over his eyes,\r\nhis head on a bank of moss, listened to their soft voices and gallantly\r\nunhooked the small and indignant gudgeon when a flash of a rod and\r\na half-suppressed scream announced a catch. The sunlight filtered\r\nthrough the leafy thickets awaking to song the forest birds. Magpies\r\nin spotless black and white flirted past, alighting near by with a hop\r\nand bound and twitch of the tail. Blue and white jays with rosy breasts\r\nshrieked through the trees, and a low-sailing hawk wheeled among the\r\nfields of ripening wheat, putting to flight flocks of twittering hedge\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nAcross the Seine a gull dropped on the water like a plume. The air was\r\npure and still. Scarcely a leaf moved. Sounds from a distant farm came\r\nfaintly, the shrill cock-crow and dull baying. Now and then a steam-tug\r\nwith big raking smoke-pipe, bearing the name “Guêpe 27,” ploughed up\r\nthe river dragging its interminable train of barges, or a sailboat\r\ndropped down with the current toward sleepy Rouen.\r\n\r\nA faint fresh odour of earth and water hung in the air, and through the\r\nsunlight, orange-tipped butterflies danced above the marsh grass, soft\r\nvelvety butterflies flapped through the mossy woods.\r\n\r\nHastings was thinking of Valentine. It was two o’clock when Elliott\r\nstrolled back, and frankly admitting that he had eluded Rowden, sat\r\ndown beside Colette and prepared to doze with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Where are your trout?” said Colette severely.\r\n\r\n“They still live,” murmured Elliott, and went fast asleep.\r\n\r\nRowden returned shortly after, and casting a scornful glance at the\r\nslumbering one, displayed three crimson-flecked trout.\r\n\r\n“And that,” smiled Hastings lazily, “that is the holy end to which the\r\nfaithful plod,—the slaughter of these small fish with a bit of silk\r\nand feather.”\r\n\r\nRowden disdained to answer him. Colette caught another gudgeon and\r\nawoke Elliott, who protested and gazed about for the lunch baskets, as\r\nClifford and Cécile came up demanding instant refreshment. Cécile’s\r\nskirts were soaked, and her gloves torn, but she was happy, and\r\nClifford, dragging out a two-pound trout, stood still to receive the\r\napplause of the company.\r\n\r\n“Where the deuce did you get that?” demanded Elliott.\r\n\r\nCécile, wet and enthusiastic, recounted the battle, and then Clifford\r\neulogized her powers with the fly, and, in proof, produced from his\r\ncreel a defunct chub, which, he observed, just missed being a trout.\r\n\r\nThey were all very happy at luncheon, and Hastings was voted\r\n“charming.” He enjoyed it immensely,—only it seemed to him at moments\r\nthat flirtation went further in France than in Millbrook, Connecticut,\r\nand he thought that Cécile might be a little less enthusiastic about\r\nClifford, that perhaps it would be quite as well if Jacqueline sat\r\nfurther away from Rowden, and that possibly Colette could have, for a\r\nmoment at least, taken her eyes from Elliott’s face. Still he enjoyed\r\nit—except when his thoughts drifted to Valentine, and then he felt\r\nthat he was very far away from her. La Roche is at least an hour and\r\na half from Paris. It is also true that he felt a happiness, a quick\r\nheart-beat when, at eight o’clock that night the train which bore them\r\nfrom La Roche rolled into the Gare St. Lazare and he was once more in\r\nthe city of Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” they said, pressing around him. “You must come with us\r\nnext time!”\r\n\r\nHe promised, and watched them, two by two, drift into the darkening\r\ncity, and stood so long that, when again he raised his eyes, the vast\r\nBoulevard was twinkling with gas-jets through which the electric lights\r\nstared like moons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nIt was with another quick heart-beat that he awoke next morning, for\r\nhis first thought was of Valentine.\r\n\r\nThe sun already gilded the towers of Notre Dame, the clatter of\r\nworkmen’s sabots awoke sharp echoes in the street below, and across\r\nthe way a blackbird in a pink almond tree was going into an ecstasy of\r\ntrills.\r\n\r\nHe determined to awake Clifford for a brisk walk in the country, hoping\r\nlater to beguile that gentleman into the American church for his soul’s\r\nsake. He found Alfred the gimlet-eyed washing the asphalt walk which\r\nled to the studio.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Elliott?” he replied to the perfunctory inquiry, “_je ne sais\r\npas_.”\r\n\r\n“And Monsieur Clifford,” began Hastings, somewhat astonished.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Clifford,” said the concierge with fine irony, “will be\r\npleased to see you, as he retired early; in fact he has just come in.”\r\n\r\nHastings hesitated while the concierge pronounced a fine eulogy on\r\npeople who never stayed out all night and then came battering at the\r\nlodge gate during hours which even a gendarme held sacred to sleep. He\r\nalso discoursed eloquently upon the beauties of temperance, and took an\r\nostentatious draught from the fountain in the court.\r\n\r\n“I do not think I will come in,” said Hastings.\r\n\r\n“Pardon, monsieur,” growled the concierge, “perhaps it would be well\r\nto see Monsieur Clifford. He possibly needs aid. Me he drives forth\r\nwith hair-brushes and boots. It is a mercy if he has not set fire to\r\nsomething with his candle.”\r\n\r\nHastings hesitated for an instant, but swallowing his dislike of such\r\na mission, walked slowly through the ivy-covered alley and across\r\nthe inner garden to the studio. He knocked. Perfect silence. Then he\r\nknocked again, and this time something struck the door from within with\r\na crash.\r\n\r\n“That,” said the concierge, “was a boot.” He fitted his duplicate key\r\ninto the lock and ushered Hastings in. Clifford, in disordered evening\r\ndress, sat on the rug in the middle of the room. He held in his hand a\r\nshoe, and did not appear astonished to see Hastings.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, do you use Pears’ soap?” he inquired with a vague wave\r\nof his hand and a vaguer smile.\r\n\r\nHastings’ heart sank. “For Heaven’s sake,” he said, “Clifford, go to\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\n“Not while that—that Alfred pokes his shaggy head in here an’ I have a\r\nshoe left.”\r\n\r\nHastings blew out the candle, picked up Clifford’s hat and cane,\r\nand said, with an emotion he could not conceal, “This is terrible,\r\nClifford,—I—never knew you did this sort of thing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I do,” said Clifford.\r\n\r\n“Where is Elliott?”\r\n\r\n“Ole chap,” returned Clifford, becoming maudlin, “Providence which\r\nfeeds—feeds—er—sparrows an’ that sort of thing watcheth over the\r\nintemperate wanderer—”\r\n\r\n“Where is Elliott?”\r\n\r\nBut Clifford only wagged his head and waved his arm about. “He’s out\r\nthere,—somewhere about.” Then suddenly feeling a desire to see his\r\nmissing chum, lifted up his voice and howled for him.\r\n\r\nHastings, thoroughly shocked, sat down on the lounge without a word.\r\nPresently, after shedding several scalding tears, Clifford brightened\r\nup and rose with great precaution.\r\n\r\n“Ole chap,” he observed, “do you want to see er—er miracle? Well, here\r\ngoes. I’m goin’ to begin.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, beaming at vacancy.\r\n\r\n“Er miracle,” he repeated.\r\n\r\nHastings supposed he was alluding to the miracle of his keeping his\r\nbalance, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n“I’m goin’ to bed,” he announced, “poor ole Clifford’s goin’ to bed,\r\nan’ that’s er miracle!”\r\n\r\nAnd he did with a nice calculation of distance and equilibrium which\r\nwould have rung enthusiastic yells of applause from Elliott had he\r\nbeen there to assist _en connaisseur_. But he was not. He had not\r\nyet reached the studio. He was on his way, however, and smiled with\r\nmagnificent condescension on Hastings, who, half an hour later, found\r\nhim reclining upon a bench in the Luxembourg. He permitted himself to\r\nbe aroused, dusted and escorted to the gate. Here, however, he refused\r\nall further assistance, and bestowing a patronizing bow upon Hastings,\r\nsteered a tolerably true course for the rue Vavin.\r\n\r\nHastings watched him out of sight, and then slowly retraced his steps\r\ntoward the fountain. At first he felt gloomy and depressed, but\r\ngradually the clear air of the morning lifted the pressure from his\r\nheart, and he sat down on the marble seat under the shadow of the\r\nwinged god.\r\n\r\nThe air was fresh and sweet with perfume from the orange flowers.\r\nEverywhere pigeons were bathing, dashing the water over their iris-hued\r\nbreasts, flashing in and out of the spray or nestling almost to the\r\nneck along the polished basin. The sparrows, too, were abroad in force,\r\nsoaking their dust-coloured feathers in the limpid pool and chirping\r\nwith might and main. Under the sycamores which surrounded the duck-pond\r\nopposite the fountain of Marie de Medici, the water-fowl cropped the\r\nherbage, or waddled in rows down the bank to embark on some solemn\r\naimless cruise.\r\n\r\nButterflies, somewhat lame from a chilly night’s repose under the lilac\r\nleaves, crawled over and over the white phlox, or took a rheumatic\r\nflight toward some sun-warmed shrub. The bees were already busy among\r\nthe heliotrope, and one or two grey flies with brick-coloured eyes sat\r\nin a spot of sunlight beside the marble seat, or chased each other\r\nabout, only to return again to the spot of sunshine and rub their\r\nfore-legs, exulting.\r\n\r\nThe sentries paced briskly before the painted boxes, pausing at times\r\nto look toward the guard-house for their relief.\r\n\r\nThey came at last, with a shuffle of feet and click of bayonets, the\r\nword was passed, the relief fell out, and away they went, crunch,\r\ncrunch, across the gravel.\r\n\r\nA mellow chime floated from the clock-tower of the palace, the deep\r\nbell of St. Sulpice echoed the stroke. Hastings sat dreaming in the\r\nshadow of the god, and while he mused somebody came and sat down beside\r\nhim. At first he did not raise his head. It was only when she spoke\r\nthat he sprang up.\r\n\r\n“You! At this hour?”\r\n\r\n“I was restless, I could not sleep.” Then in a low, happy voice—“And\r\n_you!_ at this hour?”\r\n\r\n“I—I slept, but the sun awoke me.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ could not sleep,” she said, and her eyes seemed, for a moment,\r\ntouched with an indefinable shadow. Then, smiling, “I am so glad—I\r\nseemed to know you were coming. Don’t laugh, I believe in dreams.”\r\n\r\n“Did you really dream of,—of my being here?”\r\n\r\n“I think I was awake when I dreamed it,” she admitted. Then for a\r\ntime they were mute, acknowledging by silence the happiness of being\r\ntogether. And after all their silence was eloquent, for faint smiles,\r\nand glances born of their thoughts, crossed and recrossed, until lips\r\nmoved and words were formed, which seemed almost superfluous. What they\r\nsaid was not very profound. Perhaps the most valuable jewel that fell\r\nfrom Hastings’ lips bore direct reference to breakfast.\r\n\r\n“I have not yet had my chocolate,” she confessed, “but what a material\r\nman you are.”\r\n\r\n“Valentine,” he said impulsively, “I wish,—I do wish that you\r\nwould,—just for this once,—give me the whole day,—just for this\r\nonce.”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear,” she smiled, “not only material, but selfish!”\r\n\r\n“Not selfish, hungry,” he said, looking at her.\r\n\r\n“A cannibal too; oh dear!”\r\n\r\n“Will you, Valentine?”\r\n\r\n“But my chocolate—”\r\n\r\n“Take it with me.”\r\n\r\n“But _déjeuner_—”\r\n\r\n“Together, at St. Cloud.”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t—”\r\n\r\n“Together,—all day,—all day long; will you, Valentine?”\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n“Only for this once.”\r\n\r\nAgain that indefinable shadow fell across her eyes, and when it was\r\ngone she sighed. “Yes,—together, only for this once.”\r\n\r\n“All day?” he said, doubting his happiness.\r\n\r\n“All day,” she smiled; “and oh, I am so hungry!”\r\n\r\nHe laughed, enchanted.\r\n\r\n“What a material young lady it is.”\r\n\r\nOn the Boulevard St. Michel there is a Crémerie painted white and blue\r\noutside, and neat and clean as a whistle inside. The auburn-haired\r\nyoung woman who speaks French like a native, and rejoices in the name\r\nof Murphy, smiled at them as they entered, and tossing a fresh napkin\r\nover the zinc _tête-à-tête_ table, whisked before them two cups of\r\nchocolate and a basket full of crisp, fresh croissons.\r\n\r\nThe primrose-coloured pats of butter, each stamped with a shamrock in\r\nrelief, seemed saturated with the fragrance of Normandy pastures.\r\n\r\n“How delicious!” they said in the same breath, and then laughed at the\r\ncoincidence.\r\n\r\n“With but a single thought,” he began.\r\n\r\n“How absurd!” she cried with cheeks all rosy. “I’m thinking I’d like a\r\ncroisson.”\r\n\r\n“So am I,” he replied triumphant, “that proves it.”\r\n\r\nThen they had a quarrel; she accusing him of behaviour unworthy of a\r\nchild in arms, and he denying it, and bringing counter charges, until\r\nMademoiselle Murphy laughed in sympathy, and the last croisson was\r\neaten under a flag of truce. Then they rose, and she took his arm\r\nwith a bright nod to Mile. Murphy, who cried them a merry: “_Bonjour,\r\nmadame! bonjour, monsieur_!” and watched them hail a passing cab and\r\ndrive away. “_Dieu! qu’il est beau_,” she sighed, adding after a\r\nmoment, “Do they be married, I dunno,—_ma foi ils ont bien l’air_.”\r\n\r\nThe cab swung around the rue de Medici, turned into the rue de\r\nVaugirard, followed it to where it crosses the rue de Rennes, and\r\ntaking that noisy thoroughfare, drew up before the Gare Montparnasse.\r\nThey were just in time for a train and scampered up the stairway and\r\nout to the cars as the last note from the starting-gong rang through\r\nthe arched station. The guard slammed the door of their compartment,\r\na whistle sounded, answered by a screech from the locomotive, and the\r\nlong train glided from the station, faster, faster, and sped out into\r\nthe morning sunshine. The summer wind blew in their faces from the open\r\nwindow, and sent the soft hair dancing on the girl’s forehead.\r\n\r\n“We have the compartment to ourselves,” said Hastings.\r\n\r\nShe leaned against the cushioned window-seat, her eyes bright and wide\r\nopen, her lips parted. The wind lifted her hat, and fluttered the\r\nribbons under her chin. With a quick movement she untied them, and,\r\ndrawing a long hat-pin from her hat, laid it down on the seat beside\r\nher. The train was flying.\r\n\r\nThe colour surged in her cheeks, and, with each quick-drawn breath, her\r\nbreath rose and fell under the cluster of lilies at her throat. Trees,\r\nhouses, ponds, danced past, cut by a mist of telegraph poles.\r\n\r\n“Faster! faster!” she cried.\r\n\r\nHis eyes never left her, but hers, wide open, and blue as the summer\r\nsky, seemed fixed on something far ahead,—something which came no\r\nnearer, but fled before them as they fled.\r\n\r\nWas it the horizon, cut now by the grim fortress on the hill, now by\r\nthe cross of a country chapel? Was it the summer moon, ghost-like,\r\nslipping through the vaguer blue above?\r\n\r\n“Faster! faster!” she cried.\r\n\r\nHer parted lips burned scarlet.\r\n\r\nThe car shook and shivered, and the fields streamed by like an emerald\r\ntorrent. He caught the excitement, and his faced glowed.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she cried, and with an unconscious movement caught his hand,\r\ndrawing him to the window beside her. “Look! lean out with me!”\r\n\r\nHe only saw her lips move; her voice was drowned in the roar of a\r\ntrestle, but his hand closed in hers and he clung to the sill. The wind\r\nwhistled in their ears. “Not so far out, Valentine, take care!” he\r\ngasped.\r\n\r\nBelow, through the ties of the trestle, a broad river flashed into view\r\nand out again, as the train thundered along a tunnel, and away once\r\nmore through the freshest of green fields. The wind roared about them.\r\nThe girl was leaning far out from the window, and he caught her by the\r\nwaist, crying, “Not too far!” but she only murmured, “Faster! faster!\r\naway out of the city, out of the land, faster, faster! away out of the\r\nworld!”\r\n\r\n“What are you saying all to yourself?” he said, but his voice was\r\nbroken, and the wind whirled it back into his throat.\r\n\r\nShe heard him, and, turning from the window looked down at his arm\r\nabout her. Then she raised her eyes to his. The car shook and the\r\nwindows rattled. They were dashing through a forest now, and the sun\r\nswept the dewy branches with running flashes of fire. He looked into\r\nher troubled eyes; he drew her to him and kissed the half-parted lips,\r\nand she cried out, a bitter, hopeless cry, “Not that—not that!”\r\n\r\nBut he held her close and strong, whispering words of honest love and\r\npassion, and when she sobbed—“Not that—not that—I have promised!\r\nYou must—you must know—I am—not—worthy—” In the purity of his own\r\nheart her words were, to him, meaningless then, meaningless for ever\r\nafter. Presently her voice ceased, and her head rested on his breast.\r\nHe leaned against the window, his ears swept by the furious wind, his\r\nheart in a joyous tumult. The forest was passed, and the sun slipped\r\nfrom behind the trees, flooding the earth again with brightness. She\r\nraised her eyes and looked out into the world from the window. Then she\r\nbegan to speak, but her voice was faint, and he bent his head close to\r\nhers and listened. “I cannot turn from you; I am too weak. You were\r\nlong ago my master—master of my heart and soul. I have broken my word\r\nto one who trusted me, but I have told you all;—what matters the\r\nrest?” He smiled at her innocence and she worshipped his. She spoke\r\nagain: “Take me or cast me away;—what matters it? Now with a word you\r\ncan kill me, and it might be easier to die than to look upon happiness\r\nas great as mine.”\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms, “Hush, what are you saying? Look,—look out at\r\nthe sunlight, the meadows and the streams. We shall be very happy in so\r\nbright a world.”\r\n\r\nShe turned to the sunlight. From the window, the world below seemed\r\nvery fair to her.\r\n\r\nTrembling with happiness, she sighed: “Is this the world? Then I have\r\nnever known it.”\r\n\r\n“Nor have I, God forgive me,” he murmured.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was our gentle Lady of the Fields who forgave them both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               RUE BARRÉE\r\n\r\n\r\n    “For let Philosopher and Doctor preach\r\n     Of what they will and what they will not,—each\r\n     Is but one link in an eternal chain\r\n     That none can slip nor break nor over-reach.”\r\n\r\n    “Crimson nor yellow roses nor\r\n     The savour of the mounting sea\r\n     Are worth the perfume I adore\r\n     That clings to thee.”\r\n\r\n    “The languid-headed lilies tire,\r\n     The changeless waters weary me;\r\n     I ache with passionate desire\r\n     Of thine and thee.”\r\n\r\n    “There are but these things in the world—\r\n     Thy mouth of fire,\r\n     Thy breasts, thy hands, thy hair upcurled\r\n     And my desire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nOne morning at Julian’s, a student said to Selby, “That is Foxhall\r\nClifford,” pointing with his brushes at a young man who sat before an\r\neasel, doing nothing.\r\n\r\nSelby, shy and nervous, walked over and began: “My name is Selby,—I\r\nhave just arrived in Paris, and bring a letter of introduction—” His\r\nvoice was lost in the crash of a falling easel, the owner of which\r\npromptly assaulted his neighbour, and for a time the noise of battle\r\nrolled through the studios of MM. Boulanger and Lefebvre, presently\r\nsubsiding into a scuffle on the stairs outside. Selby, apprehensive\r\nas to his own reception in the studio, looked at Clifford, who sat\r\nserenely watching the fight.\r\n\r\n“It’s a little noisy here,” said Clifford, “but you will like the\r\nfellows when you know them.” His unaffected manner delighted Selby.\r\nThen with a simplicity that won his heart, he presented him to half a\r\ndozen students of as many nationalities. Some were cordial, all were\r\npolite. Even the majestic creature who held the position of Massier,\r\nunbent enough to say: “My friend, when a man speaks French as well as\r\nyou do, and is also a friend of Monsieur Clifford, he will have no\r\ntrouble in this studio. You expect, of course, to fill the stove until\r\nthe next new man comes?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“And you don’t mind chaff?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Selby, who hated it.\r\n\r\nClifford, much amused, put on his hat, saying, “You must expect lots of\r\nit at first.”\r\n\r\nSelby placed his own hat on his head and followed him to the door.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the model stand there was a furious cry of “Chapeau!\r\nChapeau!” and a student sprang from his easel menacing Selby, who\r\nreddened but looked at Clifford.\r\n\r\n“Take off your hat for them,” said the latter, laughing.\r\n\r\nA little embarrassed, he turned and saluted the studio.\r\n\r\n“Et moi?” cried the model.\r\n\r\n“You are charming,” replied Selby, astonished at his own audacity,\r\nbut the studio rose as one man, shouting: “He has done well! he’s all\r\nright!” while the model, laughing, kissed her hand to him and cried: “À\r\ndemain beau jeune homme!”\r\n\r\nAll that week Selby worked at the studio unmolested. The French\r\nstudents christened him “l’Enfant Prodigue,” which was freely\r\ntranslated, “The Prodigious Infant,” “The Kid,” “Kid Selby,” and\r\n“Kidby.” But the disease soon ran its course from “Kidby” to “Kidney,”\r\nand then naturally to “Tidbits,” where it was arrested by Clifford’s\r\nauthority and ultimately relapsed to “Kid.”\r\n\r\nWednesday came, and with it M. Boulanger. For three hours the students\r\nwrithed under his biting sarcasms,—among the others Clifford, who\r\nwas informed that he knew even less about a work of art than he\r\ndid about the art of work. Selby was more fortunate. The professor\r\nexamined his drawing in silence, looked at him sharply, and passed on\r\nwith a non-committal gesture. He presently departed arm in arm with\r\nBouguereau, to the relief of Clifford, who was then at liberty to jam\r\nhis hat on his head and depart.\r\n\r\nThe next day he did not appear, and Selby, who had counted on seeing\r\nhim at the studio, a thing which he learned later it was vanity to\r\ncount on, wandered back to the Latin Quarter alone.\r\n\r\nParis was still strange and new to him. He was vaguely troubled by its\r\nsplendour. No tender memories stirred his American bosom at the Place\r\ndu Châtelet, nor even by Notre Dame. The Palais de Justice with its\r\nclock and turrets and stalking sentinels in blue and vermilion, the\r\nPlace St. Michel with its jumble of omnibuses and ugly water-spitting\r\ngriffins, the hill of the Boulevard St. Michel, the tooting trams, the\r\npolicemen dawdling two by two, and the table-lined terraces of the Café\r\nVacehett were nothing to him, as yet, nor did he even know, when he\r\nstepped from the stones of the Place St. Michel to the asphalt of the\r\nBoulevard, that he had crossed the frontier and entered the student\r\nzone,—the famous Latin Quarter.\r\n\r\nA cabman hailed him as “bourgeois,” and urged the superiority of\r\ndriving over walking. A gamin, with an appearance of great concern,\r\nrequested the latest telegraphic news from London, and then, standing\r\non his head, invited Selby to feats of strength. A pretty girl gave\r\nhim a glance from a pair of violet eyes. He did not see her, but she,\r\ncatching her own reflection in a window, wondered at the colour burning\r\nin her cheeks. Turning to resume her course, she met Foxhall Clifford,\r\nand hurried on. Clifford, open-mouthed, followed her with his eyes;\r\nthen he looked after Selby, who had turned into the Boulevard St.\r\nGermain toward the rue de Seine. Then he examined himself in the shop\r\nwindow. The result seemed to be unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n“I’m not a beauty,” he mused, “but neither am I a hobgoblin. What\r\ndoes she mean by blushing at Selby? I never before saw her look at a\r\nfellow in my life,—neither has any one in the Quarter. Anyway, I can\r\nswear she never looks at me, and goodness knows I have done all that\r\nrespectful adoration can do.”\r\n\r\nHe sighed, and murmuring a prophecy concerning the salvation of his\r\nimmortal soul swung into that graceful lounge which at all times\r\ncharacterized Clifford. With no apparent exertion, he overtook Selby at\r\nthe corner, and together they crossed the sunlit Boulevard and sat down\r\nunder the awning of the Café du Cercle. Clifford bowed to everybody on\r\nthe terrace, saying, “You shall meet them all later, but now let me\r\npresent you to two of the sights of Paris, Mr. Richard Elliott and Mr.\r\nStanley Rowden.”\r\n\r\nThe “sights” looked amiable, and took vermouth.\r\n\r\n“You cut the studio to-day,” said Elliott, suddenly turning on\r\nClifford, who avoided his eyes.\r\n\r\n“To commune with nature?” observed Rowden.\r\n\r\n“What’s her name this time?” asked Elliott, and Rowden answered\r\npromptly, “Name, Yvette; nationality, Breton—”\r\n\r\n“Wrong,” replied Clifford blandly, “it’s Rue Barrée.”\r\n\r\nThe subject changed instantly, and Selby listened in surprise to names\r\nwhich were new to him, and eulogies on the latest Prix de Rome winner.\r\nHe was delighted to hear opinions boldly expressed and points honestly\r\ndebated, although the vehicle was mostly slang, both English and\r\nFrench. He longed for the time when he too should be plunged into the\r\nstrife for fame.\r\n\r\nThe bells of St. Sulpice struck the hour, and the Palace of the\r\nLuxembourg answered chime on chime. With a glance at the sun, dipping\r\nlow in the golden dust behind the Palais Bourbon, they rose, and\r\nturning to the east, crossed the Boulevard St. Germain and sauntered\r\ntoward the École de Médecine. At the corner a girl passed them, walking\r\nhurriedly. Clifford smirked, Elliott and Rowden were agitated, but they\r\nall bowed, and, without raising her eyes, she returned their salute.\r\nBut Selby, who had lagged behind, fascinated by some gay shop window,\r\nlooked up to meet two of the bluest eyes he had ever seen. The eyes\r\nwere dropped in an instant, and the young fellow hastened to overtake\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n“By Jove,” he said, “do you fellows know I have just seen the prettiest\r\ngirl—” An exclamation broke from the trio, gloomy, foreboding, like\r\nthe chorus in a Greek play.\r\n\r\n“Rue Barrée!”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Selby, bewildered.\r\n\r\nThe only answer was a vague gesture from Clifford.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, during dinner, Clifford turned to Selby and said, “You\r\nwant to ask me something; I can tell by the way you fidget about.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do,” he said, innocently enough; “it’s about that girl. Who is\r\nshe?”\r\n\r\nIn Rowden’s smile there was pity, in Elliott’s bitterness.\r\n\r\n“Her name,” said Clifford solemnly, “is unknown to any one, at\r\nleast,” he added with much conscientiousness, “as far as I can learn.\r\nEvery fellow in the Quarter bows to her and she returns the salute\r\ngravely, but no man has ever been known to obtain more than that. Her\r\nprofession, judging from her music-roll, is that of a pianist. Her\r\nresidence is in a small and humble street which is kept in a perpetual\r\nprocess of repair by the city authorities, and from the black letters\r\npainted on the barrier which defends the street from traffic, she has\r\ntaken the name by which we know her,—Rue Barrée. Mr. Rowden, in his\r\nimperfect knowledge of the French tongue, called our attention to it as\r\nRoo Barry—”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t,” said Rowden hotly.\r\n\r\n“And Roo Barry, or Rue Barrée, is to-day an object of adoration to\r\nevery rapin in the Quarter—”\r\n\r\n“We are not rapins,” corrected Elliott.\r\n\r\n“_I_ am not,” returned Clifford, “and I beg to call to your attention,\r\nSelby, that these two gentlemen have at various and apparently\r\nunfortunate moments, offered to lay down life and limb at the feet of\r\nRue Barrée. The lady possesses a chilling smile which she uses on such\r\noccasions and,” here he became gloomily impressive, “I have been forced\r\nto believe that neither the scholarly grace of my friend Elliott nor\r\nthe buxom beauty of my friend Rowden have touched that heart of ice.”\r\n\r\nElliott and Rowden, boiling with indignation, cried out, “And you!”\r\n\r\n“I,” said Clifford blandly, “do fear to tread where you rush in.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours later Selby had completely forgotten Rue Barrée.\r\nDuring the week he worked with might and main at the studio, and\r\nSaturday night found him so tired that he went to bed before dinner and\r\nhad a nightmare about a river of yellow ochre in which he was drowning.\r\nSunday morning, apropos of nothing at all, he thought of Rue Barrée,\r\nand ten seconds afterwards he saw her. It was at the flower-market on\r\nthe marble bridge. She was examining a pot of pansies. The gardener had\r\nevidently thrown heart and soul into the transaction, but Rue Barrée\r\nshook her head.\r\n\r\nIt is a question whether Selby would have stopped then and there to\r\ninspect a cabbage-rose had not Clifford unwound for him the yarn of\r\nthe previous Tuesday. It is possible that his curiosity was piqued,\r\nfor with the exception of a hen-turkey, a boy of nineteen is the most\r\nopenly curious biped alive. From twenty until death he tries to conceal\r\nit. But, to be fair to Selby, it is also true that the market was\r\nattractive. Under a cloudless sky the flowers were packed and heaped\r\nalong the marble bridge to the parapet. The air was soft, the sun\r\nspun a shadowy lacework among the palms and glowed in the hearts of a\r\nthousand roses. Spring had come,—was in full tide. The watering carts\r\nand sprinklers spread freshness over the Boulevard, the sparrows had\r\nbecome vulgarly obtrusive, and the credulous Seine angler anxiously\r\nfollowed his gaudy quill floating among the soapsuds of the lavoirs.\r\nThe white-spiked chestnuts clad in tender green vibrated with the\r\nhum of bees. Shoddy butterflies flaunted their winter rags among the\r\nheliotrope. There was a smell of fresh earth in the air, an echo of\r\nthe woodland brook in the ripple of the Seine, and swallows soared and\r\nskimmed among the anchored river craft. Somewhere in a window a caged\r\nbird was singing its heart out to the sky.\r\n\r\nSelby looked at the cabbage-rose and then at the sky. Something in\r\nthe song of the caged bird may have moved him, or perhaps it was that\r\ndangerous sweetness in the air of May.\r\n\r\nAt first he was hardly conscious that he had stopped, then he was\r\nscarcely conscious why he had stopped, then he thought he would move\r\non, then he thought he wouldn’t, then he looked at Rue Barrée.\r\n\r\nThe gardener said, “Mademoiselle, this is undoubtedly a fine pot of\r\npansies.”\r\n\r\nRue Barrée shook her head.\r\n\r\nThe gardener smiled. She evidently did not want the pansies. She had\r\nbought many pots of pansies there, two or three every spring, and never\r\nargued. What did she want then? The pansies were evidently a feeler\r\ntoward a more important transaction. The gardener rubbed his hands and\r\ngazed about him.\r\n\r\n“These tulips are magnificent,” he observed, “and these hyacinths—” He\r\nfell into a trance at the mere sight of the scented thickets.\r\n\r\n“That,” murmured Rue, pointing to a splendid rose-bush with her furled\r\nparasol, but in spite of her, her voice trembled a little. Selby\r\nnoticed it, more shame to him that he was listening, and the gardener\r\nnoticed it, and, burying his nose in the roses, scented a bargain.\r\nStill, to do him justice, he did not add a centime to the honest value\r\nof the plant, for after all, Rue was probably poor, and any one could\r\nsee she was charming.\r\n\r\n“Fifty francs, Mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\nThe gardener’s tone was grave. Rue felt that argument would be wasted.\r\nThey both stood silent for a moment. The gardener did not eulogize his\r\nprize,—the rose-tree was gorgeous and any one could see it.\r\n\r\n“I will take the pansies,” said the girl, and drew two francs from\r\na worn purse. Then she looked up. A tear-drop stood in the way\r\nrefracting the light like a diamond, but as it rolled into a little\r\ncorner by her nose a vision of Selby replaced it, and when a brush of\r\nthe handkerchief had cleared the startled blue eyes, Selby himself\r\nappeared, very much embarrassed. He instantly looked up into the sky,\r\napparently devoured with a thirst for astronomical research, and as\r\nhe continued his investigations for fully five minutes, the gardener\r\nlooked up too, and so did a policeman. Then Selby looked at the tips of\r\nhis boots, the gardener looked at him and the policeman slouched on.\r\nRue Barrée had been gone some time.\r\n\r\n“What,” said the gardener, “may I offer Monsieur?”\r\n\r\nSelby never knew why, but he suddenly began to buy flowers. The\r\ngardener was electrified. Never before had he sold so many flowers,\r\nnever at such satisfying prices, and never, never with such absolute\r\nunanimity of opinion with a customer. But he missed the bargaining, the\r\narguing, the calling of Heaven to witness. The transaction lacked spice.\r\n\r\n“These tulips are magnificent!”\r\n\r\n“They are!” cried Selby warmly.\r\n\r\n“But alas, they are dear.”\r\n\r\n“I will take them.”\r\n\r\n“Dieu!” murmured the gardener in a perspiration, “he’s madder than most\r\nEnglishmen.”\r\n\r\n“This cactus—”\r\n\r\n“Is gorgeous!”\r\n\r\n“Alas—”\r\n\r\n“Send it with the rest.”\r\n\r\nThe gardener braced himself against the river wall.\r\n\r\n“That splendid rose-bush,” he began faintly.\r\n\r\n“That is a beauty. I believe it is fifty francs—”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, very red. The gardener relished his confusion. Then a\r\nsudden cool self-possession took the place of his momentary confusion\r\nand he held the gardener with his eye, and bullied him.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take that bush. Why did not the young lady buy it?”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle is not wealthy.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“_Dame_, I sell her many pansies; pansies are not expensive.”\r\n\r\n“Those are the pansies she bought?”\r\n\r\n“These, Monsieur, the blue and gold.”\r\n\r\n“Then you intend to send them to her?”\r\n\r\n“At mid-day after the market.”\r\n\r\n“Take this rose-bush with them, and”—here he glared at the\r\ngardener—“don’t you dare say from whom they came.” The gardener’s eyes\r\nwere like saucers, but Selby, calm and victorious, said: “Send the\r\nothers to the Hôtel du Sénat, 7 rue de Tournon. I will leave directions\r\nwith the concierge.”\r\n\r\nThen he buttoned his glove with much dignity and stalked off, but\r\nwhen well around the corner and hidden from the gardener’s view, the\r\nconviction that he was an idiot came home to him in a furious blush.\r\nTen minutes later he sat in his room in the Hôtel du Sénat repeating\r\nwith an imbecile smile: “What an ass I am, what an ass!”\r\n\r\nAn hour later found him in the same chair, in the same position, his\r\nhat and gloves still on, his stick in his hand, but he was silent,\r\napparently lost in contemplation of his boot toes, and his smile was\r\nless imbecile and even a bit retrospective.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nAbout five o’clock that afternoon, the little sad-eyed woman who fills\r\nthe position of concierge at the Hôtel du Sénat held up her hands in\r\namazement to see a wagon-load of flower-bearing shrubs draw up before\r\nthe doorway. She called Joseph, the intemperate garçon, who, while\r\ncalculating the value of the flowers in _petits verres_, gloomily\r\ndisclaimed any knowledge as to their destination.\r\n\r\n“_Voyons_,” said the little concierge, “_cherchons la femme_!”\r\n\r\n“You?” he suggested.\r\n\r\nThe little woman stood a moment pensive and then sighed. Joseph\r\ncaressed his nose, a nose which for gaudiness could vie with any floral\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\nThen the gardener came in, hat in hand, and a few minutes later Selby\r\nstood in the middle of his room, his coat off, his shirt-sleeves rolled\r\nup. The chamber originally contained, besides the furniture, about two\r\nsquare feet of walking room, and now this was occupied by a cactus. The\r\nbed groaned under crates of pansies, lilies and heliotrope, the lounge\r\nwas covered with hyacinths and tulips, and the washstand supported a\r\nspecies of young tree warranted to bear flowers at some time or other.\r\n\r\nClifford came in a little later, fell over a box of sweet peas, swore\r\na little, apologized, and then, as the full splendour of the floral\r\n_fête_ burst upon him, sat down in astonishment upon a geranium. The\r\ngeranium was a wreck, but Selby said, “Don’t mind,” and glared at the\r\ncactus.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to give a ball?” demanded Clifford.\r\n\r\n“N—no,—I’m very fond of flowers,” said Selby, but the statement\r\nlacked enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“I should imagine so.” Then, after a silence, “That’s a fine cactus.”\r\n\r\nSelby contemplated the cactus, touched it with the air of a\r\nconnoisseur, and pricked his thumb.\r\n\r\nClifford poked a pansy with his stick. Then Joseph came in with the\r\nbill, announcing the sum total in a loud voice, partly to impress\r\nClifford, partly to intimidate Selby into disgorging a _pourboire_\r\nwhich he would share, if he chose, with the gardener. Clifford tried\r\nto pretend that he had not heard, while Selby paid bill and tribute\r\nwithout a murmur. Then he lounged back into the room with an attempt\r\nat indifference which failed entirely when he tore his trousers on the\r\ncactus.\r\n\r\nClifford made some commonplace remark, lighted a cigarette and looked\r\nout of the window to give Selby a chance. Selby tried to take it, but\r\ngetting as far as—“Yes, spring is here at last,” froze solid. He\r\nlooked at the back of Clifford’s head. It expressed volumes. Those\r\nlittle perked-up ears seemed tingling with suppressed glee. He made a\r\ndesperate effort to master the situation, and jumped up to reach for\r\nsome Russian cigarettes as an incentive to conversation, but was foiled\r\nby the cactus, to whom again he fell a prey. The last straw was added.\r\n\r\n“Damn the cactus.” This observation was wrung from Selby against his\r\nwill,—against his own instinct of self-preservation, but the thorns on\r\nthe cactus were long and sharp, and at their repeated prick his pent-up\r\nwrath escaped. It was too late now; it was done, and Clifford had\r\nwheeled around.\r\n\r\n“See here, Selby, why the deuce did you buy those flowers?”\r\n\r\n“I’m fond of them,” said Selby.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do with them? You can’t sleep here.”\r\n\r\n“I could, if you’d help me take the pansies off the bed.”\r\n\r\n“Where can you put them?”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t I give them to the concierge?”\r\n\r\nAs soon as he said it he regretted it. What in Heaven’s name would\r\nClifford think of him! He had heard the amount of the bill. Would he\r\nbelieve that he had invested in these luxuries as a timid declaration\r\nto his concierge? And would the Latin Quarter comment upon it in\r\ntheir own brutal fashion? He dreaded ridicule and he knew Clifford’s\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nThen somebody knocked.\r\n\r\nSelby looked at Clifford with a hunted expression which touched\r\nthat young man’s heart. It was a confession and at the same time a\r\nsupplication. Clifford jumped up, threaded his way through the floral\r\nlabyrinth, and putting an eye to the crack of the door, said, “Who the\r\ndevil is it?”\r\n\r\nThis graceful style of reception is indigenous to the Quarter.\r\n\r\n“It’s Elliott,” he said, looking back, “and Rowden too, and their\r\nbulldogs.” Then he addressed them through the crack.\r\n\r\n“Sit down on the stairs; Selby and I are coming out directly.”\r\n\r\nDiscretion is a virtue. The Latin Quarter possesses few, and discretion\r\nseldom figures on the list. They sat down and began to whistle.\r\n\r\nPresently Rowden called out, “I smell flowers. They feast within!”\r\n\r\n“You ought to know Selby better than that,” growled Clifford behind the\r\ndoor, while the other hurriedly exchanged his torn trousers for others.\r\n\r\n“_We_ know Selby,” said Elliott with emphasis.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Rowden, “he gives receptions with floral decorations and\r\ninvites Clifford, while we sit on the stairs.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, while the youth and beauty of the Quarter revel,” suggested\r\nRowden; then, with sudden misgiving; “Is Odette there?”\r\n\r\n“See here,” demanded Elliott, “is Colette there?”\r\n\r\nThen he raised his voice in a plaintive howl, “Are you there, Colette,\r\nwhile I’m kicking my heels on these tiles?”\r\n\r\n“Clifford is capable of anything,” said Rowden; “his nature is soured\r\nsince Rue Barrée sat on him.”\r\n\r\nElliott raised his voice: “I say, you fellows, we saw some flowers\r\ncarried into Rue Barrée’s house at noon.”\r\n\r\n“Posies and roses,” specified Rowden.\r\n\r\n“Probably for her,” added Elliott, caressing his bulldog.\r\n\r\nClifford turned with sudden suspicion upon Selby. The latter hummed\r\na tune, selected a pair of gloves and, choosing a dozen cigarettes,\r\nplaced them in a case. Then walking over to the cactus, he deliberately\r\ndetached a blossom, drew it through his buttonhole, and picking up\r\nhat and stick, smiled upon Clifford, at which the latter was mightily\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nMonday morning at Julian’s, students fought for places; students with\r\nprior claims drove away others who had been anxiously squatting on\r\ncoveted tabourets since the door was opened in hopes of appropriating\r\nthem at roll-call; students squabbled over palettes, brushes,\r\nportfolios, or rent the air with demands for Ciceri and bread. The\r\nformer, a dirty ex-model, who had in palmier days posed as Judas, now\r\ndispensed stale bread at one sou and made enough to keep himself in\r\ncigarettes. Monsieur Julian walked in, smiled a fatherly smile and\r\nwalked out. His disappearance was followed by the apparition of the\r\nclerk, a foxy creature who flitted through the battling hordes in\r\nsearch of prey.\r\n\r\nThree men who had not paid dues were caught and summoned. A fourth was\r\nscented, followed, outflanked, his retreat towards the door cut off,\r\nand finally captured behind the stove. About that time, the revolution\r\nassuming an acute form, howls rose for “Jules!”\r\n\r\nJules came, umpired two fights with a sad resignation in his big brown\r\neyes, shook hands with everybody and melted away in the throng, leaving\r\nan atmosphere of peace and good-will. The lions sat down with the\r\nlambs, the massiers marked the best places for themselves and friends,\r\nand, mounting the model stands, opened the roll-calls.\r\n\r\nThe word was passed, “They begin with C this week.”\r\n\r\nThey did.\r\n\r\n“Clisson!”\r\n\r\nClisson jumped like a flash and marked his name on the floor in chalk\r\nbefore a front seat.\r\n\r\n“Caron!”\r\n\r\nCaron galloped away to secure his place. Bang! went an easel. “_Nom de\r\nDieu_!” in French,—“Where in h—l are you goin’!” in English. Crash!\r\na paintbox fell with brushes and all on board. “_Dieu de Dieu de_—”\r\nspat! A blow, a short rush, a clinch and scuffle, and the voice of the\r\nmassier, stern and reproachful:\r\n\r\n“Cochon!”\r\n\r\nThen the roll-call was resumed.\r\n\r\n“Clifford!”\r\n\r\nThe massier paused and looked up, one finger between the leaves of the\r\nledger.\r\n\r\n“Clifford!”\r\n\r\nClifford was not there. He was about three miles away in a direct line\r\nand every instant increased the distance. Not that he was walking\r\nfast,—on the contrary, he was strolling with that leisurely gait\r\npeculiar to himself. Elliott was beside him and two bulldogs covered\r\nthe rear. Elliott was reading the “Gil Blas,” from which he seemed\r\nto extract amusement, but deeming boisterous mirth unsuitable to\r\nClifford’s state of mind, subdued his amusement to a series of discreet\r\nsmiles. The latter, moodily aware of this, said nothing, but leading\r\nthe way into the Luxembourg Gardens installed himself upon a bench\r\nby the northern terrace and surveyed the landscape with disfavour.\r\nElliott, according to the Luxembourg regulations, tied the two dogs and\r\nthen, with an interrogative glance toward his friend, resumed the “Gil\r\nBlas” and the discreet smiles.\r\n\r\nThe day was perfect. The sun hung over Notre Dame, setting the city\r\nin a glitter. The tender foliage of the chestnuts cast a shadow over\r\nthe terrace and flecked the paths and walks with tracery so blue\r\nthat Clifford might here have found encouragement for his violent\r\n“impressions” had he but looked; but as usual in this period of his\r\ncareer, his thoughts were anywhere except in his profession. Around\r\nabout, the sparrows quarrelled and chattered their courtship songs,\r\nthe big rosy pigeons sailed from tree to tree, the flies whirled in\r\nthe sunbeams and the flowers exhaled a thousand perfumes which stirred\r\nClifford with languorous wistfulness. Under this influence he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Elliott, you are a true friend—”\r\n\r\n“You make me ill,” replied the latter, folding his paper. “It’s just\r\nas I thought,—you are tagging after some new petticoat again. And,”\r\nhe continued wrathfully, “if this is what you’ve kept me away from\r\nJulian’s for,—if it’s to fill me up with the perfections of some\r\nlittle idiot—”\r\n\r\n“Not idiot,” remonstrated Clifford gently.\r\n\r\n“See here,” cried Elliott, “have you the nerve to try to tell me that\r\nyou are in love again?”\r\n\r\n“Again?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, again and again and again and—by George have you?”\r\n\r\n“This,” observed Clifford sadly, “is serious.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Elliott would have laid hands on him, then he laughed from\r\nsheer helplessness. “Oh, go on, go on; let’s see, there’s Clémence and\r\nMarie Tellec and Cosette and Fifine, Colette, Marie Verdier—”\r\n\r\n“All of whom are charming, most charming, but I never was serious—”\r\n\r\n“So help me, Moses,” said Elliott, solemnly, “each and every one of\r\nthose named have separately and in turn torn your heart with anguish\r\nand have also made me lose my place at Julian’s in this same manner;\r\neach and every one, separately and in turn. Do you deny it?”\r\n\r\n“What you say may be founded on facts—in a way—but give me the credit\r\nof being faithful to one at a time—”\r\n\r\n“Until the next came along.”\r\n\r\n“But this,—this is really very different. Elliott, believe me, I am\r\nall broken up.”\r\n\r\nThen there being nothing else to do, Elliott gnashed his teeth and\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n“It’s—it’s Rue Barrée.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” observed Elliott, with scorn, “if you are moping and moaning\r\nover _that_ girl,—the girl who has given you and myself every reason\r\nto wish that the ground would open and engulf us,—well, go on!”\r\n\r\n“I’m going on,—I don’t care; timidity has fled—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your native timidity.”\r\n\r\n“I’m desperate, Elliott. Am I in love? Never, never did I feel so d—n\r\nmiserable. I can’t sleep; honestly, I’m incapable of eating properly.”\r\n\r\n“Same symptoms noticed in the case of Colette.”\r\n\r\n“Listen, will you?”\r\n\r\n“Hold on a moment, I know the rest by heart. Now let me ask you\r\nsomething. Is it your belief that Rue Barrée is a pure girl?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Clifford, turning red.\r\n\r\n“Do you love her,—not as you dangle and tiptoe after every pretty\r\ninanity—I mean, do you honestly love her?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the other doggedly, “I would—”\r\n\r\n“Hold on a moment; would you marry her?”\r\n\r\nClifford turned scarlet. “Yes,” he muttered.\r\n\r\n“Pleasant news for your family,” growled Elliott in suppressed fury.\r\n“‘Dear father, I have just married a charming grisette whom I’m sure\r\nyou’ll welcome with open arms, in company with her mother, a most\r\nestimable and cleanly washlady.’ Good heavens! This seems to have gone\r\na little further than the rest. Thank your stars, young man, that my\r\nhead is level enough for us both. Still, in this case, I have no fear.\r\nRue Barrée sat on your aspirations in a manner unmistakably final.”\r\n\r\n“Rue Barrée,” began Clifford, drawing himself up, but he suddenly\r\nceased, for there where the dappled sunlight glowed in spots of gold,\r\nalong the sun-flecked path, tripped Rue Barrée. Her gown was spotless,\r\nand her big straw hat, tipped a little from the white forehead, threw a\r\nshadow across her eyes.\r\n\r\nElliott stood up and bowed. Clifford removed his head-covering with\r\nan air so plaintive, so appealing, so utterly humble that Rue Barrée\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nThe smile was delicious and when Clifford, incapable of sustaining\r\nhimself on his legs from sheer astonishment, toppled slightly, she\r\nsmiled again in spite of herself. A few moments later she took a chair\r\non the terrace and drawing a book from her music-roll, turned the\r\npages, found the place, and then placing it open downwards in her lap,\r\nsighed a little, smiled a little, and looked out over the city. She had\r\nentirely forgotten Foxhall Clifford.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she took up her book again, but instead of reading began\r\nto adjust a rose in her corsage. The rose was big and red. It glowed\r\nlike fire there over her heart, and like fire it warmed her heart, now\r\nfluttering under the silken petals. Rue Barrée sighed again. She was\r\nvery happy. The sky was so blue, the air so soft and perfumed, the\r\nsunshine so caressing, and her heart sang within her, sang to the rose\r\nin her breast. This is what it sang: “Out of the throng of passers-by,\r\nout of the world of yesterday, out of the millions passing, one has\r\nturned aside to me.”\r\n\r\nSo her heart sang under his rose on her breast. Then two big\r\nmouse-coloured pigeons came whistling by and alighted on the terrace,\r\nwhere they bowed and strutted and bobbed and turned until Rue Barrée\r\nlaughed in delight, and looking up beheld Clifford before her. His hat\r\nwas in his hand and his face was wreathed in a series of appealing\r\nsmiles which would have touched the heart of a Bengal tiger.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Rue Barrée frowned, then she looked curiously at\r\nClifford, then when she saw the resemblance between his bows and the\r\nbobbing pigeons, in spite of herself, her lips parted in the most\r\nbewitching laugh. Was this Rue Barrée? So changed, so changed that she\r\ndid not know herself; but oh! that song in her heart which drowned\r\nall else, which trembled on her lips, struggling for utterance, which\r\nrippled forth in a laugh at nothing,—at a strutting pigeon,—and Mr.\r\nClifford.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“And you think, because I return the salute of the students in the\r\nQuarter, that you may be received in particular as a friend? I do\r\nnot know you, Monsieur, but vanity is man’s other name;—be content,\r\nMonsieur Vanity, I shall be punctilious—oh, most punctilious in\r\nreturning your salute.”\r\n\r\n“But I beg—I implore you to let me render you that homage which has so\r\nlong—”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear; I don’t care for homage.”\r\n\r\n“Let me only be permitted to speak to you now and\r\nthen,—occasionally—very occasionally.”\r\n\r\n“And if _you_, why not another?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,—I will be discretion itself.”\r\n\r\n“Discretion—why?”\r\n\r\nHer eyes were very clear, and Clifford winced for a moment, but only\r\nfor a moment. Then the devil of recklessness seizing him, he sat\r\ndown and offered himself, soul and body, goods and chattels. And all\r\nthe time he knew he was a fool and that infatuation is not love, and\r\nthat each word he uttered bound him in honour from which there was no\r\nescape. And all the time Elliott was scowling down on the fountain\r\nplaza and savagely checking both bulldogs from their desire to rush to\r\nClifford’s rescue,—for even they felt there was something wrong, as\r\nElliott stormed within himself and growled maledictions.\r\n\r\nWhen Clifford finished, he finished in a glow of excitement, but Rue\r\nBarrée’s response was long in coming and his ardour cooled while the\r\nsituation slowly assumed its just proportions. Then regret began to\r\ncreep in, but he put that aside and broke out again in protestations.\r\nAt the first word Rue Barrée checked him.\r\n\r\n“I thank you,” she said, speaking very gravely. “No man has ever before\r\noffered me marriage.” She turned and looked out over the city. After\r\na while she spoke again. “You offer me a great deal. I am alone, I\r\nhave nothing, I am nothing.” She turned again and looked at Paris,\r\nbrilliant, fair, in the sunshine of a perfect day. He followed her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she murmured, “it is hard,—hard to work always—always alone\r\nwith never a friend you can have in honour, and the love that is\r\noffered means the streets, the boulevard—when passion is dead. I know\r\nit,—_we_ know it,—we others who have nothing,—have no one, and who\r\ngive ourselves, unquestioning—when we love,—yes, unquestioning—heart\r\nand soul, knowing the end.”\r\n\r\nShe touched the rose at her breast. For a moment she seemed to forget\r\nhim, then quietly—“I thank you, I am very grateful.” She opened the\r\nbook and, plucking a petal from the rose, dropped it between the\r\nleaves. Then looking up she said gently, “I cannot accept.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nIt took Clifford a month to entirely recover, although at the end of\r\nthe first week he was pronounced convalescent by Elliott, who was an\r\nauthority, and his convalescence was aided by the cordiality with\r\nwhich Rue Barrée acknowledged his solemn salutes. Forty times a day he\r\nblessed Rue Barrée for her refusal, and thanked his lucky stars, and at\r\nthe same time, oh, wondrous heart of ours!—he suffered the tortures of\r\nthe blighted.\r\n\r\nElliott was annoyed, partly by Clifford’s reticence, partly by the\r\nunexplainable thaw in the frigidity of Rue Barrée. At their frequent\r\nencounters, when she, tripping along the rue de Seine, with music-roll\r\nand big straw hat would pass Clifford and his familiars steering an\r\neasterly course to the Café Vachette, and at the respectful uncovering\r\nof the band would colour and smile at Clifford, Elliott’s slumbering\r\nsuspicions awoke. But he never found out anything, and finally gave\r\nit up as beyond his comprehension, merely qualifying Clifford as an\r\nidiot and reserving his opinion of Rue Barrée. And all this time Selby\r\nwas jealous. At first he refused to acknowledge it to himself, and\r\ncut the studio for a day in the country, but the woods and fields of\r\ncourse aggravated his case, and the brooks babbled of Rue Barrée and\r\nthe mowers calling to each other across the meadow ended in a quavering\r\n“Rue Bar-rée-e!” That day spent in the country made him angry for\r\na week, and he worked sulkily at Julian’s, all the time tormented\r\nby a desire to know where Clifford was and what he might be doing.\r\nThis culminated in an erratic stroll on Sunday which ended at the\r\nflower-market on the Pont au Change, began again, was gloomily extended\r\nto the morgue, and again ended at the marble bridge. It would never do,\r\nand Selby felt it, so he went to see Clifford, who was convalescing on\r\nmint juleps in his garden.\r\n\r\nThey sat down together and discussed morals and human happiness, and\r\neach found the other most entertaining, only Selby failed to pump\r\nClifford, to the other’s unfeigned amusement. But the juleps spread\r\nbalm on the sting of jealousy, and trickled hope to the blighted, and\r\nwhen Selby said he must go, Clifford went too, and when Selby, not\r\nto be outdone, insisted on accompanying Clifford back to his door,\r\nClifford determined to see Selby back half way, and then finding it\r\nhard to part, they decided to dine together and “flit.” To flit, a verb\r\napplied to Clifford’s nocturnal prowls, expressed, perhaps, as well\r\nas anything, the gaiety proposed. Dinner was ordered at Mignon’s, and\r\nwhile Selby interviewed the chef, Clifford kept a fatherly eye on the\r\nbutler. The dinner was a success, or was of the sort generally termed\r\na success. Toward the dessert Selby heard some one say as at a great\r\ndistance, “Kid Selby, drunk as a lord.”\r\n\r\nA group of men passed near them; it seemed to him that he shook hands\r\nand laughed a great deal, and that everybody was very witty. There\r\nwas Clifford opposite swearing undying confidence in his chum Selby,\r\nand there seemed to be others there, either seated beside them or\r\ncontinually passing with the swish of skirts on the polished floor.\r\nThe perfume of roses, the rustle of fans, the touch of rounded arms\r\nand the laughter grew vaguer and vaguer. The room seemed enveloped in\r\nmist. Then, all in a moment each object stood out painfully distinct,\r\nonly forms and visages were distorted and voices piercing. He drew\r\nhimself up, calm, grave, for the moment master of himself, but very\r\ndrunk. He knew he was drunk, and was as guarded and alert, as keenly\r\nsuspicious of himself as he would have been of a thief at his elbow.\r\nHis self-command enabled Clifford to hold his head safely under some\r\nrunning water, and repair to the street considerably the worse for\r\nwear, but never suspecting that his companion was drunk. For a time he\r\nkept his self-command. His face was only a bit paler, a bit tighter\r\nthan usual; he was only a trifle slower and more fastidious in his\r\nspeech. It was midnight when he left Clifford peacefully slumbering\r\nin somebody’s arm-chair, with a long suede glove dangling in his hand\r\nand a plumy boa twisted about his neck to protect his throat from\r\ndrafts. He walked through the hall and down the stairs, and found\r\nhimself on the sidewalk in a quarter he did not know. Mechanically\r\nhe looked up at the name of the street. The name was not familiar.\r\nHe turned and steered his course toward some lights clustered at the\r\nend of the street. They proved farther away than he had anticipated,\r\nand after a long quest he came to the conclusion that his eyes had\r\nbeen mysteriously removed from their proper places and had been reset\r\non either side of his head like those of a bird. It grieved him to\r\nthink of the inconvenience this transformation might occasion him, and\r\nhe attempted to cock up his head, hen-like, to test the mobility of\r\nhis neck. Then an immense despair stole over him,—tears gathered in\r\nthe tear-ducts, his heart melted, and he collided with a tree. This\r\nshocked him into comprehension; he stifled the violent tenderness in\r\nhis breast, picked up his hat and moved on more briskly. His mouth was\r\nwhite and drawn, his teeth tightly clinched. He held his course pretty\r\nwell and strayed but little, and after an apparently interminable\r\nlength of time found himself passing a line of cabs. The brilliant\r\nlamps, red, yellow, and green annoyed him, and he felt it might be\r\npleasant to demolish them with his cane, but mastering this impulse he\r\npassed on. Later an idea struck him that it would save fatigue to take\r\na cab, and he started back with that intention, but the cabs seemed\r\nalready so far away and the lanterns were so bright and confusing that\r\nhe gave it up, and pulling himself together looked around.\r\n\r\nA shadow, a mass, huge, undefined, rose to his right. He recognized\r\nthe Arc de Triomphe and gravely shook his cane at it. Its size annoyed\r\nhim. He felt it was too big. Then he heard something fall clattering\r\nto the pavement and thought probably it was his cane but it didn’t\r\nmuch matter. When he had mastered himself and regained control of\r\nhis right leg, which betrayed symptoms of insubordination, he found\r\nhimself traversing the Place de la Concorde at a pace which threatened\r\nto land him at the Madeleine. This would never do. He turned sharply\r\nto the right and crossing the bridge passed the Palais Bourbon at\r\na trot and wheeled into the Boulevard St. Germain. He got on well\r\nenough although the size of the War Office struck him as a personal\r\ninsult, and he missed his cane, which it would have been pleasant\r\nto drag along the iron railings as he passed. It occurred to him,\r\nhowever, to substitute his hat, but when he found it he forgot what\r\nhe wanted it for and replaced it upon his head with gravity. Then he\r\nwas obliged to battle with a violent inclination to sit down and weep.\r\nThis lasted until he came to the rue de Rennes, but there he became\r\nabsorbed in contemplating the dragon on the balcony overhanging the\r\nCour du Dragon, and time slipped away until he remembered vaguely that\r\nhe had no business there, and marched off again. It was slow work.\r\nThe inclination to sit down and weep had given place to a desire for\r\nsolitary and deep reflection. Here his right leg forgot its obedience\r\nand attacking the left, outflanked it and brought him up against a\r\nwooden board which seemed to bar his path. He tried to walk around\r\nit, but found the street closed. He tried to push it over, and found\r\nhe couldn’t. Then he noticed a red lantern standing on a pile of\r\npaving-stones inside the barrier. This was pleasant. How was he to get\r\nhome if the boulevard was blocked? But he was not on the boulevard. His\r\ntreacherous right leg had beguiled him into a detour, for there, behind\r\nhim lay the boulevard with its endless line of lamps,—and here, what\r\nwas this narrow dilapidated street piled up with earth and mortar and\r\nheaps of stone? He looked up. Written in staring black letters on the\r\nbarrier was\r\n\r\n                               RUE BARRÉE.\r\n\r\nHe sat down. Two policemen whom he knew came by and advised him to get\r\nup, but he argued the question from a standpoint of personal taste,\r\nand they passed on, laughing. For he was at that moment absorbed in a\r\nproblem. It was, how to see Rue Barrée. She was somewhere or other in\r\nthat big house with the iron balconies, and the door was locked, but\r\nwhat of that? The simple idea struck him to shout until she came. This\r\nidea was replaced by another equally lucid,—to hammer on the door\r\nuntil she came; but finally rejecting both of these as too uncertain,\r\nhe decided to climb into the balcony, and opening a window politely\r\ninquire for Rue Barrée. There was but one lighted window in the house\r\nthat he could see. It was on the second floor, and toward this he cast\r\nhis eyes. Then mounting the wooden barrier and clambering over the\r\npiles of stones, he reached the sidewalk and looked up at the façade\r\nfor a foothold. It seemed impossible. But a sudden fury seized him, a\r\nblind, drunken obstinacy, and the blood rushed to his head, leaping,\r\nbeating in his ears like the dull thunder of an ocean. He set his\r\nteeth, and springing at a window-sill, dragged himself up and hung to\r\nthe iron bars. Then reason fled; there surged in his brain the sound of\r\nmany voices, his heart leaped up beating a mad tattoo, and gripping at\r\ncornice and ledge he worked his way along the façade, clung to pipes\r\nand shutters, and dragged himself up, over and into the balcony by the\r\nlighted window. His hat fell off and rolled against the pane. For a\r\nmoment he leaned breathless against the railing—then the window was\r\nslowly opened from within.\r\n\r\nThey stared at each other for some time. Presently the girl took two\r\nunsteady steps back into the room. He saw her face,—all crimsoned\r\nnow,—he saw her sink into a chair by the lamplit table, and without\r\na word he followed her into the room, closing the big door-like panes\r\nbehind him. Then they looked at each other in silence.\r\n\r\nThe room was small and white; everything was white about it,—the\r\ncurtained bed, the little wash-stand in the corner, the bare walls, the\r\nchina lamp,—and his own face,—had he known it, but the face and neck\r\nof Rue were surging in the colour that dyed the blossoming rose-tree\r\nthere on the hearth beside her. It did not occur to him to speak. She\r\nseemed not to expect it. His mind was struggling with the impressions\r\nof the room. The whiteness, the extreme purity of everything occupied\r\nhim—began to trouble him. As his eye became accustomed to the light,\r\nother objects grew from the surroundings and took their places in the\r\ncircle of lamplight. There was a piano and a coal-scuttle and a little\r\niron trunk and a bath-tub. Then there was a row of wooden pegs against\r\nthe door, with a white chintz curtain covering the clothes underneath.\r\nOn the bed lay an umbrella and a big straw hat, and on the table, a\r\nmusic-roll unfurled, an ink-stand, and sheets of ruled paper. Behind\r\nhim stood a wardrobe faced with a mirror, but somehow he did not care\r\nto see his own face just then. He was sobering.\r\n\r\nThe girl sat looking at him without a word. Her face was\r\nexpressionless, yet the lips at times trembled almost imperceptibly.\r\nHer eyes, so wonderfully blue in the daylight, seemed dark and soft as\r\nvelvet, and the colour on her neck deepened and whitened with every\r\nbreath. She seemed smaller and more slender than when he had seen her\r\nin the street, and there was now something in the curve of her cheek\r\nalmost infantine. When at last he turned and caught his own reflection\r\nin the mirror behind him, a shock passed through him as though he had\r\nseen a shameful thing, and his clouded mind and his clouded thoughts\r\ngrew clearer. For a moment their eyes met then his sought the floor,\r\nhis lips tightened, and the struggle within him bowed his head and\r\nstrained every nerve to the breaking. And now it was over, for the\r\nvoice within had spoken. He listened, dully interested but already\r\nknowing the end,—indeed it little mattered;—the end would always be\r\nthe same for him;—he understood now—always the same for him, and he\r\nlistened, dully interested, to a voice which grew within him. After\r\na while he stood up, and she rose at once, one small hand resting on\r\nthe table. Presently he opened the window, picked up his hat, and shut\r\nit again. Then he went over to the rosebush and touched the blossoms\r\nwith his face. One was standing in a glass of water on the table and\r\nmechanically the girl drew it out, pressed it with her lips and laid\r\nit on the table beside him. He took it without a word and crossing the\r\nroom, opened the door. The landing was dark and silent, but the girl\r\nlifted the lamp and gliding past him slipped down the polished stairs\r\nto the hallway. Then unchaining the bolts, she drew open the iron\r\nwicket.\r\n\r\nThrough this he passed with his rose.", "chapters": [{"title": "THE KING IN YELLOW", "startIndex": 0}, {"title": "ROBERT W.
