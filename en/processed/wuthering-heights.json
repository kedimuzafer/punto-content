{"text": "Wuthering Heights\n\nby Emily Brontë\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n1801—I have just returned from a visit to my landlord—the solitary\nneighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful\ncountry! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a\nsituation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect\nmisanthropist’s Heaven—and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable\npair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little\nimagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes\nwithdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his\nfingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further\nin his waistcoat, as I announced my name.\n\n“Mr. Heathcliff?” I said.\n\nA nod was the answer.\n\n“Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling\nas soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have\nnot inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation\nof Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts—”\n\n“Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,” he interrupted, wincing. “I should\nnot allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it—walk in!”\n\nThe “walk in” was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the\nsentiment, “Go to the Deuce!” even the gate over which he leant\nmanifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that\ncircumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested\nin a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.\n\nWhen he saw my horse’s breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put\nout his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the\ncauseway, calling, as we entered the court,—“Joseph, take Mr.\nLockwood’s horse; and bring up some wine.”\n\n“Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,” was the\nreflection suggested by this compound order. “No wonder the grass grows\nup between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.”\n\nJoseph was an elderly, nay, an old man, very old, perhaps, though hale\nand sinewy. “The Lord help us!” he soliloquised in an undertone of\npeevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,\nin my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of\ndivine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no\nreference to my unexpected advent.\n\nWuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. “Wuthering”\nbeing a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the\natmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.\nPure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed:\none may guess the power of the north wind, blowing over the edge, by\nthe excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and\nby a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if\ncraving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build\nit strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the\ncorners defended with large jutting stones.\n\nBefore passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of\ngrotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the\nprincipal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins\nand shameless little boys, I detected the date “1500,” and the name\n“Hareton Earnshaw.” I would have made a few comments, and requested a\nshort history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at\nthe door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure,\nand I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting\nthe penetralium.\n\nOne step brought us into the family sitting-room, without any\nintroductory lobby or passage: they call it here “the house”\npre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I\nbelieve at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat\naltogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of\ntongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I\nobserved no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge\nfireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on\nthe walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat\nfrom ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and\ntankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very\nroof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay\nbare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with\noatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.\nAbove the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of\nhorse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily painted canisters\ndisposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the\nchairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two\nheavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser\nreposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of\nsquealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.\n\nThe apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as\nbelonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance,\nand stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.\nSuch an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on\nthe round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six\nmiles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner. But\nMr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of\nliving. He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a\ngentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire:\nrather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence,\nbecause he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.\nPossibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred\npride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of\nthe sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to\nshowy displays of feeling—to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He’ll\nlove and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of\nimpertinence to be loved or hated again. No, I’m running on too fast: I\nbestow my own attributes over-liberally on him. Mr. Heathcliff may have\nentirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he\nmeets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me. Let me hope\nmy constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should\nnever have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself\nperfectly unworthy of one.\n\nWhile enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown\ninto the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my\neyes, as long as she took no notice of me. I “never told my love”\nvocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have\nguessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked\na return—the sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I\nconfess it with shame—shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every\nglance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was\nled to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her\nsupposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.\n\nBy this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of\ndeliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate.\n\nI took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which\nmy landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by\nattempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and\nwas sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and\nher white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long,\nguttural gnarl.\n\n“You’d better let the dog alone,” growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,\nchecking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. “She’s not\naccustomed to be spoiled—not kept for a pet.” Then, striding to a side\ndoor, he shouted again, “Joseph!”\n\nJoseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no\nintimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me\n_vis-à-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs,\nwho shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not\nanxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but,\nimagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately\nindulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my\nphysiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and\nleapt on my knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the\ntable between us. This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen\nfour-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens\nto the common centre. I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects\nof assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I\ncould with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance\nfrom some of the household in re-establishing peace.\n\nMr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious\nphlegm: I don’t think they moved one second faster than usual, though\nthe hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an\ninhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch; a lusty dame, with\ntucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the\nmidst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her\ntongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she\nonly remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master\nentered on the scene.\n\n“What the devil is the matter?” he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I\ncould ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.\n\n“What the devil, indeed!” I muttered. “The herd of possessed swine\ncould have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours,\nsir. You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!”\n\n“They won’t meddle with persons who touch nothing,” he remarked,\nputting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table. “The\ndogs do right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?”\n\n“No, thank you.”\n\n“Not bitten, are you?”\n\n“If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.” Heathcliff’s\ncountenance relaxed into a grin.\n\n“Come, come,” he said, “you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood. Here, take a\nlittle wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my\ndogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them. Your\nhealth, sir?”\n\nI bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be\nfoolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides,\nI felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since\nhis humour took that turn. He—probably swayed by prudential\nconsideration of the folly of offending a good tenant—relaxed a little\nin the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs,\nand introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me,—a\ndiscourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of\nretirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and\nbefore I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another\nvisit to-morrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I\nshall go, notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself\ncompared with him.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nYesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend\nit by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to\nWuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.—I dine\nbetween twelve and one o’clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken\nas a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend\nmy request that I might be served at five)—on mounting the stairs with\nthis lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl\non her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an\ninfernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.\nThis spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a\nfour-miles’ walk, arrived at Heathcliff’s garden-gate just in time to\nescape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.\n\nOn that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the\nair made me shiver through every limb. Being unable to remove the\nchain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered\nwith straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till\nmy knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.\n\n“Wretched inmates!” I ejaculated, mentally, “you deserve perpetual\nisolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least,\nI would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don’t care—I will\nget in!” So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.\nVinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the\nbarn.\n\n“What are ye for?” he shouted. “T’ maister’s down i’ t’ fowld. Go round\nby th’ end o’ t’ laith, if ye went to spake to him.”\n\n“Is there nobody inside to open the door?” I hallooed, responsively.\n\n“There’s nobbut t’ missis; and shoo’ll not oppen ’t an ye mak’ yer\nflaysome dins till neeght.”\n\n“Why? Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?”\n\n“Nor-ne me! I’ll hae no hend wi’t,” muttered the head, vanishing.\n\nThe snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another\ntrial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,\nappeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after\nmarching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,\npump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful\napartment where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the\nradiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and\nnear the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to\nobserve the “missis,” an individual whose existence I had never\npreviously suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me\ntake a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained\nmotionless and mute.\n\n“Rough weather!” I remarked. “I’m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door\nmust bear the consequence of your servants’ leisure attendance: I had\nhard work to make them hear me.”\n\nShe never opened her mouth. I stared—she stared also: at any rate, she\nkept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly\nembarrassing and disagreeable.\n\n“Sit down,” said the young man, gruffly. “He’ll be in soon.”\n\nI obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this\nsecond interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of\nowning my acquaintance.\n\n“A beautiful animal!” I commenced again. “Do you intend parting with\nthe little ones, madam?”\n\n“They are not mine,” said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than\nHeathcliff himself could have replied.\n\n“Ah, your favourites are among these?” I continued, turning to an\nobscure cushion full of something like cats.\n\n“A strange choice of favourites!” she observed scornfully.\n\nUnluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew\ncloser to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the\nevening.\n\n“You should not have come out,” she said, rising and reaching from the\nchimney-piece two of the painted canisters.\n\nHer position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct\nview of her whole figure and countenance. She was slender, and\napparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most\nexquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;\nsmall features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging\nloose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in\nexpression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my\nsusceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between\nscorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected\nthere. The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to\naid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted\nto assist him in counting his gold.\n\n“I don’t want your help,” she snapped; “I can get them for myself.”\n\n“I beg your pardon!” I hastened to reply.\n\n“Were you asked to tea?” she demanded, tying an apron over her neat\nblack frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the\npot.\n\n“I shall be glad to have a cup,” I answered.\n\n“Were you asked?” she repeated.\n\n“No,” I said, half smiling. “You are the proper person to ask me.”\n\nShe flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet;\nher forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a\nchild’s ready to cry.\n\nMeanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby\nupper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on\nme from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some\nmortal feud unavenged between us. I began to doubt whether he were a\nservant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of\nthe superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown\ncurls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly\nover his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common\nlabourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed\nnone of a domestic’s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.\nIn the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to\nabstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes\nafterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure,\nfrom my uncomfortable state.\n\n“You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!” I exclaimed, assuming\nthe cheerful; “and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if\nyou can afford me shelter during that space.”\n\n“Half an hour?” he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; “I\nwonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.\nDo you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes? People\nfamiliar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I\ncan tell you there is no chance of a change at present.”\n\n“Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the\nGrange till morning—could you spare me one?”\n\n“No, I could not.”\n\n“Oh, indeed! Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.”\n\n“Umph!”\n\n“Are you going to mak’ the tea?” demanded he of the shabby coat,\nshifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.\n\n“Is _he_ to have any?” she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.\n\n“Get it ready, will you?” was the answer, uttered so savagely that I\nstarted. The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad\nnature. I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.\nWhen the preparations were finished, he invited me with—“Now, sir,\nbring forward your chair.” And we all, including the rustic youth, drew\nround the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our\nmeal.\n\nI thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort\nto dispel it. They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it\nwas impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal\nscowl they wore was their every-day countenance.\n\n“It is strange,” I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea\nand receiving another—“it is strange how custom can mould our tastes\nand ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life\nof such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff;\nyet, I’ll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with\nyour amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart—”\n\n“My amiable lady!” he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on\nhis face. “Where is she—my amiable lady?”\n\n“Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.”\n\n“Well, yes—oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of\nministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even\nwhen her body is gone. Is that it?”\n\nPerceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it. I might have\nseen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to\nmake it likely that they were man and wife. One was about forty: a\nperiod of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of\nbeing married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace\nof our declining years. The other did not look seventeen.\n\nThen it flashed upon me—“The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea\nout of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her\nhusband: Heathcliff junior, of course. Here is the consequence of being\nburied alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer\nignorance that better individuals existed! A sad pity—I must beware how\nI cause her to regret her choice.” The last reflection may seem\nconceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as bordering on\nrepulsive; I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.\n\n“Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,” said Heathcliff, corroborating\nmy surmise. He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a\nlook of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles\nthat will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of\nhis soul.\n\n“Ah, certainly—I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the\nbeneficent fairy,” I remarked, turning to my neighbour.\n\nThis was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his\nfist, with every appearance of a meditated assault. But he seemed to\nrecollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,\nmuttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.\n\n“Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,” observed my host; “we neither of us\nhave the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead. I said\nshe was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.”\n\n“And this young man is—”\n\n“Not my son, assuredly.”\n\nHeathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to\nattribute the paternity of that bear to him.\n\n“My name is Hareton Earnshaw,” growled the other; “and I’d counsel you\nto respect it!”\n\n“I’ve shown no disrespect,” was my reply, laughing internally at the\ndignity with which he announced himself.\n\nHe fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for\nfear I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity\naudible. I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant\nfamily circle. The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than\nneutralised, the glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to\nbe cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third time.\n\nThe business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of\nsociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A\nsorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and\nhills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.\n\n“I don’t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,” I\ncould not help exclaiming. “The roads will be buried already; and, if\nthey were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.”\n\n“Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch. They’ll be\ncovered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,”\nsaid Heathcliff.\n\n“How must I do?” I continued, with rising irritation.\n\nThere was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only\nJoseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff\nleaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of\nmatches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the\ntea-canister to its place. The former, when he had deposited his\nburden, took a critical survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated\nout—“Aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i’ idleness un war,\nwhen all on ’ems goan out! Bud yah’re a nowt, and it’s no use\ntalking—yah’ll niver mend o’yer ill ways, but goa raight to t’ divil,\nlike yer mother afore ye!”\n\nI imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to\nme; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an\nintention of kicking him out of the door. Mrs. Heathcliff, however,\nchecked me by her answer.\n\n“You scandalous old hypocrite!” she replied. “Are you not afraid of\nbeing carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil’s name? I\nwarn you to refrain from provoking me, or I’ll ask your abduction as a\nspecial favour! Stop! look here, Joseph,” she continued, taking a long,\ndark book from a shelf; “I’ll show you how far I’ve progressed in the\nBlack Art: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it. The\nred cow didn’t die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be\nreckoned among providential visitations!”\n\n“Oh, wicked, wicked!” gasped the elder; “may the Lord deliver us from\nevil!”\n\n“No, reprobate! you are a castaway—be off, or I’ll hurt you seriously!\nI’ll have you all modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes\nthe limits I fix shall—I’ll not say what he shall be done to—but,\nyou’ll see! Go, I’m looking at you!”\n\nThe little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and\nJoseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and\nejaculating “wicked” as he went. I thought her conduct must be prompted\nby a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured\nto interest her in my distress.\n\n“Mrs. Heathcliff,” I said earnestly, “you must excuse me for troubling\nyou. I presume, because, with that face, I’m sure you cannot help being\ngood-hearted. Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way\nhome: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to\nget to London!”\n\n“Take the road you came,” she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair,\nwith a candle, and the long book open before her. “It is brief advice,\nbut as sound as I can give.”\n\n“Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full\nof snow, your conscience won’t whisper that it is partly your fault?”\n\n“How so? I cannot escort you. They wouldn’t let me go to the end of the\ngarden wall.”\n\n“_You_! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my\nconvenience, on such a night,” I cried. “I want you to _tell_ me my\nway, not to _show_ it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a\nguide.”\n\n“Who? There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I. Which would you\nhave?”\n\n“Are there no boys at the farm?”\n\n“No; those are all.”\n\n“Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.”\n\n“That you may settle with your host. I have nothing to do with it.”\n\n“I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on\nthese hills,” cried Heathcliff’s stern voice from the kitchen entrance.\n“As to staying here, I don’t keep accommodations for visitors: you must\nshare a bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.”\n\n“I can sleep on a chair in this room,” I replied.\n\n“No, no! A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit\nme to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!” said\nthe unmannerly wretch.\n\nWith this insult my patience was at an end. I uttered an expression of\ndisgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in\nmy haste. It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and,\nas I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour\namongst each other. At first the young man appeared about to befriend\nme.\n\n“I’ll go with him as far as the park,” he said.\n\n“You’ll go with him to hell!” exclaimed his master, or whatever\nrelation he bore. “And who is to look after the horses, eh?”\n\n“A man’s life is of more consequence than one evening’s neglect of the\nhorses: somebody must go,” murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I\nexpected.\n\n“Not at your command!” retorted Hareton. “If you set store on him,\nyou’d better be quiet.”\n\n“Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will\nnever get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,” she answered,\nsharply.\n\n“Hearken, hearken, shoo’s cursing on ’em!” muttered Joseph, towards\nwhom I had been steering.\n\nHe sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern,\nwhich I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it\nback on the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern.\n\n“Maister, maister, he’s staling t’ lanthern!” shouted the ancient,\npursuing my retreat. “Hey, Gnasher! Hey, dog! Hey Wolf, holld him,\nholld him!”\n\nOn opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat,\nbearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw\nfrom Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and\nhumiliation. Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching\ntheir paws, and yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me\nalive; but they would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie\ntill their malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and\ntrembling with wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out—on their\nperil to keep me one minute longer—with several incoherent threats of\nretaliation that, in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of\nKing Lear.\n\nThe vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the\nnose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded. I don’t know\nwhat would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at\nhand rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my\nentertainer. This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued\nforth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought that some\nof them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack\nher master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger\nscoundrel.\n\n“Well, Mr. Earnshaw,” she cried, “I wonder what you’ll have agait next?\nAre we going to murder folk on our very door-stones? I see this house\nwill never do for me—look at t’ poor lad, he’s fair choking! Wisht,\nwisht; you mun’n’t go on so. Come in, and I’ll cure that: there now,\nhold ye still.”\n\nWith these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my\nneck, and pulled me into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed, his\naccidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.\n\nI was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled\nperforce to accept lodgings under his roof. He told Zillah to give me a\nglass of brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she\ncondoled with me on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders,\nwhereby I was somewhat revived, ushered me to bed.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nWhile leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the\ncandle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about\nthe chamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there\nwillingly. I asked the reason. She did not know, she answered: she had\nonly lived there a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on,\nshe could not begin to be curious.\n\nToo stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced\nround for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a\nclothes-press, and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top\nresembling coach windows. Having approached this structure, I looked\ninside, and perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch,\nvery conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of\nthe family having a room to himself. In fact, it formed a little\ncloset, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a\ntable.\n\nI slid back the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them\ntogether again, and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff,\nand every one else.\n\nThe ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up\nin one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.\nThis writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of\ncharacters, large and small—_Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied\nto _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_.\n\nIn vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued\nspelling over Catherine Earnshaw—Heathcliff—Linton, till my eyes\nclosed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white\nletters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres—the air swarmed\nwith Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I\ndiscovered my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and\nperfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.\n\nI snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under the influence of cold and\nlingering nausea, sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee.\nIt was a Testament, in lean type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a\nfly-leaf bore the inscription—“Catherine Earnshaw, her book,” and a\ndate some quarter of a century back.\n\nI shut it, and took up another and another, till I had examined all.\nCatherine’s library was select, and its state of dilapidation proved it\nto have been well used, though not altogether for a legitimate purpose:\nscarcely one chapter had escaped a pen-and-ink commentary—at least the\nappearance of one—covering every morsel of blank that the printer had\nleft. Some were detached sentences; other parts took the form of a\nregular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish hand. At the top of an\nextra page (quite a treasure, probably, when first lighted on) I was\ngreatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend\nJoseph,—rudely, yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled\nwithin me for the unknown Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher\nher faded hieroglyphics.\n\n“An awful Sunday,” commenced the paragraph beneath. “I wish my father\nwere back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute—his conduct to\nHeathcliff is atrocious—H. and I are going to rebel—we took our\ninitiatory step this evening.\n\n“All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to church, so\nJoseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret; and, while\nHindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire—doing\nanything but reading their Bibles, I’ll answer for it—Heathcliff,\nmyself, and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our\nprayer-books, and mount: we were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn,\ngroaning and shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so\nthat he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The\nservice lasted precisely three hours; and yet my brother had the face\nto exclaim, when he saw us descending, ‘What, done already?’ On Sunday\nevenings we used to be permitted to play, if we did not make much\nnoise; now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners.\n\n“‘You forget you have a master here,’ says the tyrant. ‘I’ll demolish\nthe first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and\nsilence. Oh, boy! was that you? Frances darling, pull his hair as you\ngo by: I heard him snap his fingers.’ Frances pulled his hair heartily,\nand then went and seated herself on her husband’s knee, and there they\nwere, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour—foolish\npalaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our\nmeans allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our\npinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, when in comes\nJoseph, on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork,\nboxes my ears, and croaks:\n\n“‘T’ maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath not o’ered, und t’ sound\no’ t’ gospel still i’ yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking! Shame on ye!\nsit ye down, ill childer! there’s good books eneugh if ye’ll read ’em:\nsit ye down, and think o’ yer sowls!’\n\n“Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions that we might\nreceive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the\nlumber he thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my\ndingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I\nhated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there\nwas a hubbub!\n\n“‘Maister Hindley!’ shouted our chaplain. ‘Maister, coom hither! Miss\nCathy’s riven th’ back off “Th’ Helmet o’ Salvation,” un’ Heathcliff’s\npawsed his fit into t’ first part o’ “T’ Brooad Way to Destruction!”\nIt’s fair flaysome that ye let ’em go on this gait. Ech! th’ owd man\nwad ha’ laced ’em properly—but he’s goan!’\n\n“Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and seizing one of\nus by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into the\nback-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated, ‘owd Nick’ would fetch us as\nsure as we were living: and, so comforted, we each sought a separate\nnook to await his advent. I reached this book, and a pot of ink from a\nshelf, and pushed the house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got\nthe time on with writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is\nimpatient, and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman’s\ncloak, and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter. A pleasant\nsuggestion—and then, if the surly old man come in, he may believe his\nprophecy verified—we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we\nare here.”\n\n* * * * * *\n\nI suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next sentence took\nup another subject: she waxed lachrymose.\n\n“How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so!” she\nwrote. “My head aches, till I cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I\ncan’t give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond, and\nwon’t let him sit with us, nor eat with us any more; and, he says, he\nand I must not play together, and threatens to turn him out of the\nhouse if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father (how dared\nhe?) for treating H. too liberally; and swears he will reduce him to\nhis right place—”\n\n* * * * * *\n\nI began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered from\nmanuscript to print. I saw a red ornamented title—“Seventy Times Seven,\nand the First of the Seventy-First. A Pious Discourse delivered by the\nReverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough.” And while\nI was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez\nBranderham would make of his subject, I sank back in bed, and fell\nasleep. Alas, for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! What else\ncould it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I don’t remember\nanother that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of\nsuffering.\n\nI began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality.\nI thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph\nfor a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered\non, my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not\nbrought a pilgrim’s staff: telling me that I could never get into the\nhouse without one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel,\nwhich I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it\nabsurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own\nresidence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there: we\nwere journeying to hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the\ntext—“Seventy Times Seven;” and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had\ncommitted the “First of the Seventy-First,” and were to be publicly\nexposed and excommunicated.\n\nWe came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks, twice or\nthrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow,\nnear a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes\nof embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept\nwhole hitherto; but as the clergyman’s stipend is only twenty pounds\nper annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to\ndetermine into one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor:\nespecially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let\nhim starve than increase the living by one penny from their own\npockets. However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and attentive\ncongregation; and he preached—good God! what a sermon; divided into\n_four hundred and ninety_ parts, each fully equal to an ordinary\naddress from the pulpit, and each discussing a separate sin! Where he\nsearched for them, I cannot tell. He had his private manner of\ninterpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin\ndifferent sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious\ncharacter: odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.\n\nOh, how weary I grew. How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and\nrevived! How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and\nstood up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he\nwould _ever_ have done. I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he\nreached the “_First of the Seventy-First_.” At that crisis, a sudden\ninspiration descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez\nBranderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.\n\n“Sir,” I exclaimed, “sitting here within these four walls, at one\nstretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads\nof your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat\nand been about to depart—Seventy times seven times have you\npreposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and\nninety-first is too much. Fellow-martyrs, have at him! Drag him down,\nand crush him to atoms, that the place which knows him may know him no\nmore!”\n\n“_Thou art the Man!_” cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over\nhis cushion. “Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy\nvisage—seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul—Lo, this is\nhuman weakness: this also may be absolved! The First of the\nSeventy-First is come. Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written.\nSuch honour have all His saints!”\n\nWith that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim’s\nstaves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in\nself-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most\nferocious assailant, for his. In the confluence of the multitude,\nseveral clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.\nPresently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter\nrappings: every man’s hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham,\nunwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud\ntaps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at\nlast, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me. And what was it that had\nsuggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabez’s part in the\nrow? Merely the branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the\nblast wailed by, and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I\nlistened doubtingly an instant; detected the disturber, then turned and\ndozed, and dreamt again: if possible, still more disagreeably than\nbefore.\n\nThis time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard\ndistinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also,\nthe fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right\ncause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if\npossible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the\ncasement. The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance\nobserved by me when awake, but forgotten. “I must stop it,\nnevertheless!” I muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and\nstretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch; instead of\nwhich, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!\n\nThe intense horror of nightmare came over me: I tried to draw back my\narm, but the hand clung to it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed,\n\n“Let me in—let me in!”\n\n“Who are you?” I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.\n\n“Catherine Linton,” it replied, shiveringly (why did I think of\n_Linton_? I had read _Earnshaw_ twenty times for Linton)—“I’m come\nhome: I’d lost my way on the moor!”\n\nAs it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child’s face looking through the\nwindow. Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt\nshaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and\nrubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes:\nstill it wailed, “Let me in!” and maintained its tenacious gripe,\nalmost maddening me with fear.\n\n“How can I!” I said at length. “Let _me_ go, if you want me to let you\nin!”\n\nThe fingers relaxed, I snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled\nthe books up in a pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude\nthe lamentable prayer.\n\nI seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the\ninstant I listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!\n\n“Begone!” I shouted. “I’ll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty\nyears.”\n\n“It is twenty years,” mourned the voice: “twenty years. I’ve been a\nwaif for twenty years!”\n\nThereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile of books moved\nas if thrust forward.\n\nI tried to jump up; but could not stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in\na frenzy of fright.\n\nTo my confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps\napproached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous\nhand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.\nI sat shuddering, yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead:\nthe intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.\n\nAt last, he said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer,\n\n“Is any one here?”\n\nI considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew Heathcliff’s\naccents, and feared he might search further, if I kept quiet.\n\nWith this intention, I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon\nforget the effect my action produced.\n\nHeathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a\ncandle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall\nbehind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric\nshock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and\nhis agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.\n\n“It is only your guest, sir,” I called out, desirous to spare him the\nhumiliation of exposing his cowardice further. “I had the misfortune to\nscream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare. I’m sorry I\ndisturbed you.”\n\n“Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were at the—” commenced\nmy host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible\nto hold it steady. “And who showed you up into this room?” he\ncontinued, crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to\nsubdue the maxillary convulsions. “Who was it? I’ve a good mind to turn\nthem out of the house this moment!”\n\n“It was your servant Zillah,” I replied, flinging myself on to the\nfloor, and rapidly resuming my garments. “I should not care if you did,\nMr. Heathcliff; she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to\nget another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense. Well, it\nis—swarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up,\nI assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked Heathcliff, “and what are you doing? Lie down\nand finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for Heaven’s sake!\ndon’t repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you\nwere having your throat cut!”\n\n“If the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have\nstrangled me!” I returned. “I’m not going to endure the persecutions of\nyour hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabez Branderham\nakin to you on the mother’s side? And that minx, Catherine Linton, or\nEarnshaw, or however she was called—she must have been a\nchangeling—wicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the\nearth these twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal\ntransgressions, I’ve no doubt!”\n\nScarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of\nHeathcliff’s with Catherine’s name in the book, which had completely\nslipped from my memory, till thus awakened. I blushed at my\ninconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the\noffence, I hastened to add—“The truth is, sir, I passed the first part\nof the night in—” Here I stopped afresh—I was about to say “perusing\nthose old volumes,” then it would have revealed my knowledge of their\nwritten, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I\nwent on—“in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge. A\nmonotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or—”\n\n“What _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me!_” thundered\nHeathcliff with savage vehemence. “How—how _dare_ you, under my\nroof?—God! he’s mad to speak so!” And he struck his forehead with rage.\n\nI did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my\nexplanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and\nproceeded with my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation\nof “Catherine Linton” before, but reading it often over produced an\nimpression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination\nunder control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the\nbed, as I spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I\nguessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he\nstruggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show\nhim that I had heard the conflict, I continued my toilette rather\nnoisily, looked at my watch, and soliloquised on the length of the\nnight: “Not three o’clock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six.\nTime stagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at eight!”\n\n“Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,” said my host, suppressing\na groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm’s shadow, dashing\na tear from his eyes. “Mr. Lockwood,” he added, “you may go into my\nroom: you’ll only be in the way, coming downstairs so early: and your\nchildish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.”\n\n“And for me, too,” I replied. “I’ll walk in the yard till daylight, and\nthen I’ll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.\nI’m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or\ntown. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.”\n\n“Delightful company!” muttered Heathcliff. “Take the candle, and go\nwhere you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard,\nthough, the dogs are unchained; and the house—Juno mounts sentinel\nthere, and—nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But,\naway with you! I’ll come in two minutes!”\n\nI obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the\nnarrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a\npiece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly,\nhis apparent sense. He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the\nlattice, bursting, as he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion\nof tears. “Come in! come in!” he sobbed. “Cathy, do come. Oh, do—_once_\nmore! Oh! my heart’s darling! hear me _this_ time, Catherine, at last!”\nThe spectre showed a spectre’s ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of\nbeing; but the snow and wind whirled wildly through, even reaching my\nstation, and blowing out the light.\n\nThere was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this\nraving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off,\nhalf angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my\nridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was\nbeyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions,\nand landed in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly\ntogether, enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except\na brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a\nquerulous mew.\n\nTwo benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the\nhearth; on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the\nother. We were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and\nthen it was Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the\nroof, through a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose. He cast a\nsinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between\nthe ribs, swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in\nthe vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with\ntobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of\nimpudence too shameful for remark: he silently applied the tube to his\nlips, folded his arms, and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury\nunannoyed; and after sucking out his last wreath, and heaving a\nprofound sigh, he got up, and departed as solemnly as he came.\n\nA more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a\n“good-morning,” but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for\nHareton Earnshaw was performing his orison _sotto voce_, in a series of\ncurses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a\ncorner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over\nthe back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of\nexchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed,\nby his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard\ncouch, made a movement to follow him. He noticed this, and thrust at an\ninner door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate\nsound that there was the place where I must go, if I changed my\nlocality.\n\nIt opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah\nurging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs.\nHeathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the\nblaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her\neyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to\nchide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog,\nnow and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was\nsurprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire, his back\ntowards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever\nand anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron,\nand heave an indignant groan.\n\n“And you, you worthless—” he broke out as I entered, turning to his\ndaughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or\nsheep, but generally represented by a dash—. “There you are, at your\nidle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their bread—you live on my\ncharity! Put your trash away, and find something to do. You shall pay\nme for the plague of having you eternally in my sight—do you hear,\ndamnable jade?”\n\n“I’ll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse,” answered\nthe young lady, closing her book, and throwing it on a chair. “But I’ll\nnot do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I\nplease!”\n\nHeathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance,\nobviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be\nentertained by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if\neager to partake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any\nknowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to\nsuspend further hostilities: Heathcliff placed his fists, out of\ntemptation, in his pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked\nto a seat far off, where she kept her word by playing the part of a\nstatue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined\njoining their breakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an\nopportunity of escaping into the free air, now clear, and still, and\ncold as impalpable ice.\n\nMy landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the\ngarden, and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he\ndid, for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean; the swells\nand falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the\nground: many pits, at least, were filled to a level; and entire ranges\nof mounds, the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my\nyesterday’s walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side\nof the road, at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright\nstones, continued through the whole length of the barren: these were\nerected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark,\nand also when a fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on\neither hand with the firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing\nup here and there, all traces of their existence had vanished: and my\ncompanion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the\nright or left, when I imagined I was following, correctly, the windings\nof the road.\n\nWe exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the entrance of\nThrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error there. Our adieux were\nlimited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own\nresources; for the porter’s lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance\nfrom the gate to the Grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make\nit four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the\nneck in snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it\ncan appreciate. At any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock\nchimed twelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for\nevery mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.\n\nMy human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me; exclaiming,\ntumultuously, they had completely given me up: everybody conjectured\nthat I perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set\nabout the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet, now that they saw\nme returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged upstairs;\nwhence, after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro thirty or\nforty minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned to my study,\nfeeble as a kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and\nsmoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nWhat vain weather-cocks we are! I, who had determined to hold myself\nindependent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at\nlength, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable—I,\nweak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits\nand solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under\npretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my\nestablishment, I desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit\ndown while I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip,\nand either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.\n\n“You have lived here a considerable time,” I commenced; “did you not\nsay sixteen years?”\n\n“Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her;\nafter she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.”\n\n“Indeed.”\n\nThere ensued a pause. She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her\nown affairs, and those could hardly interest me. However, having\nstudied for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of\nmeditation over her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated—“Ah, times are\ngreatly changed since then!”\n\n“Yes,” I remarked, “you’ve seen a good many alterations, I suppose?”\n\n“I have: and troubles too,” she said.\n\n“Oh, I’ll turn the talk on my landlord’s family!” I thought to myself.\n“A good subject to start! And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to\nknow her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is\nmore probable, an exotic that the surly _indigenae_ will not recognise\nfor kin.” With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let\nThrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence\nso much inferior. “Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good\norder?” I inquired.\n\n“Rich, sir!” she returned. “He has nobody knows what money, and every\nyear it increases. Yes, yes, he’s rich enough to live in a finer house\nthan this: but he’s very near—close-handed; and, if he had meant to\nflit to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he\ncould not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more.\nIt is strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the\nworld!”\n\n“He had a son, it seems?”\n\n“Yes, he had one—he is dead.”\n\n“And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Where did she come from originally?”\n\n“Why, sir, she is my late master’s daughter: Catherine Linton was her\nmaiden name. I nursed her, poor thing! I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would\nremove here, and then we might have been together again.”\n\n“What! Catherine Linton?” I exclaimed, astonished. But a minute’s\nreflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine. “Then,” I\ncontinued, “my predecessor’s name was Linton?”\n\n“It was.”\n\n“And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr.\nHeathcliff? Are they relations?”\n\n“No; he is the late Mrs. Linton’s nephew.”\n\n“The young lady’s cousin, then?”\n\n“Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother’s, the\nother on the father’s side: Heathcliff married Mr. Linton’s sister.”\n\n“I see the house at Wuthering Heights has ‘Earnshaw’ carved over the\nfront door. Are they an old family?”\n\n“Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is\nof us—I mean, of the Lintons. Have you been to Wuthering Heights? I beg\npardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!”\n\n“Mrs. Heathcliff? she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I\nthink, not very happy.”\n\n“Oh dear, I don’t wonder! And how did you like the master?”\n\n“A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean. Is not that his character?”\n\n“Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone! The less you meddle with\nhim the better.”\n\n“He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl.\nDo you know anything of his history?”\n\n“It’s a cuckoo’s, sir—I know all about it: except where he was born,\nand who were his parents, and how he got his money at first. And\nHareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock! The unfortunate\nlad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has\nbeen cheated.”\n\n“Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of\nmy neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good\nenough to sit and chat an hour.”\n\n“Oh, certainly, sir! I’ll just fetch a little sewing, and then I’ll sit\nas long as you please. But you’ve caught cold: I saw you shivering, and\nyou must have some gruel to drive it out.”\n\nThe worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head\nfelt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to\na pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain. This caused me to\nfeel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious\neffects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday. She returned\npresently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having\nplaced the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to\nfind me so companionable.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBefore I came to live here, she commenced—waiting no farther invitation\nto her story—I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my\nmother had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton’s father, and\nI got used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped\nto make hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody\nwould set me to. One fine summer morning—it was the beginning of\nharvest, I remember—Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came downstairs,\ndressed for a journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be\ndone during the day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me—for I sat\neating my porridge with them—and he said, speaking to his son, “Now, my\nbonny man, I’m going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you? You\nmay choose what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there\nand back: sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!” Hindley named a\nfiddle, and then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but\nshe could ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip. He did\nnot forget me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe\nsometimes. He promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and\nthen he kissed his children, said good-bye, and set off.\n\nIt seemed a long while to us all—the three days of his absence—and\noften did little Cathy ask when he would be home. Mrs. Earnshaw\nexpected him by supper-time on the third evening, and she put the meal\noff hour after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at\nlast the children got tired of running down to the gate to look. Then\nit grew dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to\nbe allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven o’clock, the door-latch\nwas raised quietly, and in stepped the master. He threw himself into a\nchair, laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was\nnearly killed—he would not have such another walk for the three\nkingdoms.\n\n“And at the end of it to be flighted to death!” he said, opening his\ngreat-coat, which he held bundled up in his arms. “See here, wife! I\nwas never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e’en take it\nas a gift of God; though it’s as dark almost as if it came from the\ndevil.”\n\nWe crowded round, and over Miss Cathy’s head I had a peep at a dirty,\nragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed,\nits face looked older than Catherine’s; yet when it was set on its\nfeet, it only stared round, and repeated over and over again some\ngibberish that nobody could understand. I was frightened, and Mrs.\nEarnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how\nhe could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had\ntheir own bairns to feed and fend for? What he meant to do with it, and\nwhether he were mad? The master tried to explain the matter; but he was\nreally half dead with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst\nher scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and\nas good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and\ninquired for its owner. Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said;\nand his money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take\nit home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there: because he\nwas determined he would not leave it as he found it. Well, the\nconclusion was, that my mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr.\nEarnshaw told me to wash it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep\nwith the children.\n\nHindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till\npeace was restored: then, both began searching their father’s pockets\nfor the presents he had promised them. The former was a boy of\nfourteen, but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to\nmorsels in the great-coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she\nlearned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger,\nshowed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing;\nearning for her pains a sound blow from her father, to teach her\ncleaner manners. They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or\neven in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing\nof the stairs, hoping it might be gone on the morrow. By chance, or\nelse attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw’s door,\nand there he found it on quitting his chamber. Inquiries were made as\nto how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my\ncowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.\n\nThis was Heathcliff’s first introduction to the family. On coming back\na few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual),\nI found they had christened him “Heathcliff”: it was the name of a son\nwho died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for\nChristian and surname. Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but\nHindley hated him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued\nand went on with him shamefully: for I wasn’t reasonable enough to feel\nmy injustice, and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when\nshe saw him wronged.\n\nHe seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment:\nhe would stand Hindley’s blows without winking or shedding a tear, and\nmy pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if\nhe had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame. This\nendurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son\npersecuting the poor fatherless child, as he called him. He took to\nHeathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said\nprecious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above\nCathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.\n\nSo, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at\nMrs. Earnshaw’s death, which happened in less than two years after, the\nyoung master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather\nthan a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent’s affections\nand his privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these\ninjuries. I sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the\nmeasles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at\nonce, I changed my idea. Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he\nlay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose\nhe felt I did a good deal for him, and he hadn’t wit to guess that I\nwas compelled to do it. However, I will say this, he was the quietest\nchild that ever nurse watched over. The difference between him and the\nothers forced me to be less partial. Cathy and her brother harassed me\nterribly: _he_ was as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not\ngentleness, made him give little trouble.\n\nHe got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing\nto me, and praised me for my care. I was vain of his commendations, and\nsoftened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus\nHindley lost his last ally: still I couldn’t dote on Heathcliff, and I\nwondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy;\nwho never, to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of\ngratitude. He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply\ninsensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and\nconscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to\nbend to his wishes. As an instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought\na couple of colts at the parish fair, and gave the lads each one.\nHeathcliff took the handsomest, but it soon fell lame, and when he\ndiscovered it, he said to Hindley—\n\n“You must exchange horses with me: I don’t like mine; and if you won’t\nI shall tell your father of the three thrashings you’ve given me this\nweek, and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.” Hindley put\nout his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears. “You’d better do it at\nonce,” he persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable):\n“you will have to: and if I speak of these blows, you’ll get them again\nwith interest.” “Off, dog!” cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron\nweight used for weighing potatoes and hay. “Throw it,” he replied,\nstanding still, “and then I’ll tell how you boasted that you would turn\nme out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn\nyou out directly.” Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and\ndown he fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and,\nhad not I prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and\ngot full revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who\nhad caused it. “Take my colt, Gipsy, then!” said young Earnshaw. “And I\npray that he may break your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly\ninterloper! and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards\nshow him what you are, imp of Satan.—And take that, I hope he’ll kick\nout your brains!”\n\nHeathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall;\nhe was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking\nhim under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes\nwere fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could. I was surprised to\nwitness how coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his\nintention; exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a\nbundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned,\nbefore he entered the house. I persuaded him easily to let me lay the\nblame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale was told\nsince he had what he wanted. He complained so seldom, indeed, of such\nstirs as these, that I really thought him not vindictive: I was\ndeceived completely, as you will hear.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nIn the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. He had been active\nand healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was\nconfined to the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable. A nothing\nvexed him; and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into\nfits. This was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose\nupon, or domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a\nword should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head\nthe notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to\ndo him an ill-turn. It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder\namong us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his\npartiality; and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child’s\npride and black tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice,\nor thrice, Hindley’s manifestation of scorn, while his father was near,\nroused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and\nshook with rage that he could not do it.\n\nAt last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by\nteaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land\nhimself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr.\nEarnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said—“Hindley was\nnought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.”\n\nI hoped heartily we should have peace now. It hurt me to think the\nmaster should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed. I fancied the\ndiscontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as\nhe would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his\nsinking frame. We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for\ntwo people—Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay,\nup yonder. He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest\nself-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the\npromises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours. By his\nknack of sermonising and pious discoursing, he contrived to make a\ngreat impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master\nbecame, the more influence he gained. He was relentless in worrying him\nabout his soul’s concerns, and about ruling his children rigidly. He\nencouraged him to regard Hindley as a reprobate; and, night after\nnight, he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against\nHeathcliff and Catherine: always minding to flatter Earnshaw’s weakness\nby heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.\n\nCertainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up\nbefore; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener\nin a day: from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to\nbed, we had not a minute’s security that she wouldn’t be in mischief.\nHer spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always\ngoing—singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the\nsame. A wild, wicked slip she was—but she had the bonniest eye, the\nsweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I\nbelieve she meant no harm; for when once she made you cry in good\nearnest, it seldom happened that she would not keep you company, and\noblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her. She was much too\nfond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her was\nto keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than any of us\non his account. In play, she liked exceedingly to act the little\nmistress; using her hands freely, and commanding her companions: she\ndid so to me, but I would not bear slapping and ordering; and so I let\nher know.\n\nNow, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: he had\nalways been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had\nno idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing\ncondition than he was in his prime. His peevish reproofs wakened in her\na naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we\nwere all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy\nlook, and her ready words; turning Joseph’s religious curses into\nridicule, baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most—showing\nhow her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over\nHeathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in\nanything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination. After\nbehaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to\nmake it up at night. “Nay, Cathy,” the old man would say, “I cannot\nlove thee, thou’rt worse than thy brother. Go, say thy prayers, child,\nand ask God’s pardon. I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever\nreared thee!” That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed\ncontinually hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was\nsorry for her faults, and beg to be forgiven.\n\nBut the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw’s troubles on\nearth. He died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the\nfire-side. A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the\nchimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were\nall together—I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting,\nand Joseph reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally\nsat in the house then, after their work was done). Miss Cathy had been\nsick, and that made her still; she leant against her father’s knee, and\nHeathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap. I remember\nthe master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair—it\npleased him rarely to see her gentle—and saying, “Why canst thou not\nalways be a good lass, Cathy?” And she turned her face up to his, and\nlaughed, and answered, “Why cannot you always be a good man, father?”\nBut as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said\nshe would sing him to sleep. She began singing very low, till his\nfingers dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast. Then I told\nher to hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him. We all kept as\nmute as mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only\nJoseph, having finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse\nthe master for prayers and bed. He stepped forward, and called him by\nname, and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the\ncandle and looked at him. I thought there was something wrong as he set\ndown the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them\nto “frame upstairs, and make little din—they might pray alone that\nevening—he had summut to do.”\n\n“I shall bid father good-night first,” said Catherine, putting her arms\nround his neck, before we could hinder her. The poor thing discovered\nher loss directly—she screamed out—“Oh, he’s dead, Heathcliff! he’s\ndead!” And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.\n\nI joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we\ncould be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven. He\ntold me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the\nparson. I could not guess the use that either would be of, then.\nHowever, I went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor,\nback with me; the other said he would come in the morning. Leaving\nJoseph to explain matters, I ran to the children’s room: their door was\najar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but\nthey were calmer, and did not need me to console them. The little souls\nwere comforting each other with better thoughts than I could have hit\non: no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they\ndid, in their innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could\nnot help wishing we were all there safe together.\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nMr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and—a thing that amazed us, and\nset the neighbours gossiping right and left—he brought a wife with him.\nWhat she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably,\nshe had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely\nhave kept the union from his father.\n\nShe was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own\naccount. Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold,\nappeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about\nher: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the\nmourners. I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that\nwent on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I\nshould have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and\nclasping her hands, and asking repeatedly—“Are they gone yet?” Then she\nbegan describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her\nto see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell\na-weeping—and when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn’t\nknow; but she felt so afraid of dying! I imagined her as little likely\nto die as myself. She was rather thin, but young, and\nfresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds. I did\nremark, to be sure, that mounting the stairs made her breathe very\nquick; that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver, and that\nshe coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these\nsymptoms portended, and had no impulse to sympathise with her. We don’t\nin general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they take to\nus first.\n\nYoung Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his\nabsence. He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and\ndressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told\nJoseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the\nback-kitchen, and leave the house for him. Indeed, he would have\ncarpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour; but his wife\nexpressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace,\nat the pewter dishes and delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space\nthere was to move about in where they usually sat, that he thought it\nunnecessary to her comfort, and so dropped the intention.\n\nShe expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new\nacquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran\nabout with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning.\nHer affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish,\nHindley became tyrannical. A few words from her, evincing a dislike to\nHeathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy.\nHe drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the\ninstructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of\ndoors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the\nfarm.\n\nHeathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy\ntaught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the\nfields. They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the\nyoung master being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they\ndid, so they kept clear of him. He would not even have seen after their\ngoing to church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his\ncarelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to\norder Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or\nsupper. But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the\nmoors in the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment\ngrew a mere thing to laugh at. The curate might set as many chapters as\nhe pleased for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash\nHeathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they\nwere together again: at least the minute they had contrived some\nnaughty plan of revenge; and many a time I’ve cried to myself to watch\nthem growing more reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable,\nfor fear of losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended\ncreatures. One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from\nthe sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind;\nand when I went to call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere.\nWe searched the house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they\nwere invisible: and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the\ndoors, and swore nobody should let them in that night. The household\nwent to bed; and I, too anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put\nmy head out to hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in\nspite of the prohibition, should they return. In a while, I\ndistinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of a lantern\nglimmered through the gate. I threw a shawl over my head and ran to\nprevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by knocking. There was\nHeathcliff, by himself: it gave me a start to see him alone.\n\n“Where is Miss Catherine?” I cried hurriedly. “No accident, I hope?”\n“At Thrushcross Grange,” he answered; “and I would have been there too,\nbut they had not the manners to ask me to stay.” “Well, you will catch\nit!” I said: “you’ll never be content till you’re sent about your\nbusiness. What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?”\n“Let me get off my wet clothes, and I’ll tell you all about it, Nelly,”\nhe replied. I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he\nundressed and I waited to put out the candle, he continued—“Cathy and I\nescaped from the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a\nglimpse of the Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see\nwhether the Lintons passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in\ncorners, while their father and mother sat eating and drinking, and\nsinging and laughing, and burning their eyes out before the fire. Do\nyou think they do? Or reading sermons, and being catechised by their\nman-servant, and set to learn a column of Scripture names, if they\ndon’t answer properly?” “Probably not,” I responded. “They are good\nchildren, no doubt, and don’t deserve the treatment you receive, for\nyour bad conduct.” “Don’t cant, Nelly,” he said: “nonsense! We ran from\nthe top of the Heights to the park, without stopping—Catherine\ncompletely beaten in the race, because she was barefoot. You’ll have to\nseek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow. We crept through a broken\nhedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves on a\nflower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came from thence;\nthey had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only half\nclosed. Both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement,\nand clinging to the ledge, and we saw—ah! it was beautiful—a splendid\nplace carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and\na pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops hanging\nin silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with little soft\ntapers. Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar and his sister\nhad it entirely to themselves. Shouldn’t they have been happy? We\nshould have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what your good\nchildren were doing? Isabella—I believe she is eleven, a year younger\nthan Cathy—lay screaming at the farther end of the room, shrieking as\nif witches were running red-hot needles into her. Edgar stood on the\nhearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little\ndog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual accusations,\nwe understood they had nearly pulled in two between them. The idiots!\nThat was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm\nhair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get it,\nrefused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we did\ndespise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine\nwanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and\nsobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I’d not\nexchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton’s\nat Thrushcross Grange—not if I might have the privilege of flinging\nJoseph off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with\nHindley’s blood!”\n\n“Hush, hush!” I interrupted. “Still you have not told me, Heathcliff,\nhow Catherine is left behind?”\n\n“I told you we laughed,” he answered. “The Lintons heard us, and with\none accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and\nthen a cry, ‘Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh,\npapa, oh!’ They really did howl out something in that way. We made\nfrightful noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off\nthe ledge, because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had\nbetter flee. I had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all\nat once she fell down. ‘Run, Heathcliff, run!’ she whispered. ‘They\nhave let the bull-dog loose, and he holds me!’ The devil had seized her\nankle, Nelly: I heard his abominable snorting. She did not yell out—no!\nshe would have scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns\nof a mad cow. I did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate\nany fiend in Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his\njaws, and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat. A beast\nof a servant came up with a lantern, at last, shouting—‘Keep fast,\nSkulker, keep fast!’ He changed his note, however, when he saw\nSkulker’s game. The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple tongue\nhanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips streaming\nwith bloody slaver. The man took Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear,\nI’m certain, but from pain. He carried her in; I followed, grumbling\nexecrations and vengeance. ‘What prey, Robert?’ hallooed Linton from\nthe entrance. ‘Skulker has caught a little girl, sir,’ he replied; ‘and\nthere’s a lad here,’ he added, making a clutch at me, ‘who looks an\nout-and-outer! Very like the robbers were for putting them through the\nwindow to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep, that they\nmight murder us at their ease. Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed\nthief, you! you shall go to the gallows for this. Mr. Linton, sir,\ndon’t lay by your gun.’ ‘No, no, Robert,’ said the old fool. ‘The\nrascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day: they thought to have me\ncleverly. Come in; I’ll furnish them a reception. There, John, fasten\nthe chain. Give Skulker some water, Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his\nstronghold, and on the Sabbath, too! Where will their insolence stop?\nOh, my dear Mary, look here! Don’t be afraid, it is but a boy—yet the\nvillain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness to\nthe country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in acts as\nwell as features?’ He pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton\nplaced her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror. The\ncowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella lisping—‘Frightful thing!\nPut him in the cellar, papa. He’s exactly like the son of the\nfortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. Isn’t he, Edgar?’\n\n“While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech,\nand laughed. Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected\nsufficient wit to recognise her. They see us at church, you know,\nthough we seldom meet them elsewhere. ‘That’s Miss Earnshaw!’ he\nwhispered to his mother, ‘and look how Skulker has bitten her—how her\nfoot bleeds!’\n\n“‘Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!’ cried the dame; ‘Miss Earnshaw scouring the\ncountry with a gipsy! And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning—surely\nit is—and she may be lamed for life!’\n\n“‘What culpable carelessness in her brother!’ exclaimed Mr. Linton,\nturning from me to Catherine. ‘I’ve understood from Shielders’” (that\nwas the curate, sir) “‘that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.\nBut who is this? Where did she pick up this companion? Oho! I declare\nhe is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey\nto Liverpool—a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.’\n\n“‘A wicked boy, at all events,’ remarked the old lady, ‘and quite unfit\nfor a decent house! Did you notice his language, Linton? I’m shocked\nthat my children should have heard it.’\n\n“I recommenced cursing—don’t be angry, Nelly—and so Robert was ordered\nto take me off. I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the\ngarden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw\nshould be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly,\nsecured the door again. The curtains were still looped up at one\ncorner, and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had\nwished to return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a\nmillion of fragments, unless they let her out. She sat on the sofa\nquietly. Mrs. Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we\nhad borrowed for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with\nher, I suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction\nbetween her treatment and mine. Then the woman-servant brought a basin\nof warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of\nnegus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar\nstood gaping at a distance. Afterwards, they dried and combed her\nbeautiful hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled\nher to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her\nfood between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he\nate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the\nLintons—a dim reflection from her own enchanting face. I saw they were\nfull of stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably superior to them—to\neverybody on earth, is she not, Nelly?”\n\n“There will more come of this business than you reckon on,” I answered,\ncovering him up and extinguishing the light. “You are incurable,\nHeathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if\nhe won’t.” My words came truer than I desired. The luckless adventure\nmade Earnshaw furious. And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a\nvisit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture\non the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about\nhim, in earnest. Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that\nthe first word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal;\nand Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint\nwhen she returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would\nhave found it impossible.\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nCathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas. By that\ntime her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved. The\nmistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of\nreform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and\nflattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless\nlittle savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all\nbreathless, there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified\nperson, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered\nbeaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with\nboth hands that she might sail in. Hindley lifted her from her horse,\nexclaiming delightedly, “Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! I should\nscarcely have known you: you look like a lady now. Isabella Linton is\nnot to be compared with her, is she, Frances?” “Isabella has not her\nnatural advantages,” replied his wife: “but she must mind and not grow\nwild again here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things—Stay,\ndear, you will disarrange your curls—let me untie your hat.”\n\nI removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk\nfrock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes\nsparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she\ndared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid\ngarments. She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas\ncake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked\nround for Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their\nmeeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what\ngrounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.\n\nHeathcliff was hard to discover, at first. If he were careless, and\nuncared for, before Catherine’s absence, he had been ten times more so\nsince. Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy,\nand bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom\nhave a natural pleasure in soap and water. Therefore, not to mention\nhis clothes, which had seen three months’ service in mire and dust, and\nhis thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally\nbeclouded. He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a\nbright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed\ncounterpart of himself, as he expected. “Is Heathcliff not here?” she\ndemanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully\nwhitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.\n\n“Heathcliff, you may come forward,” cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his\ndiscomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard\nhe would be compelled to present himself. “You may come and wish Miss\nCatherine welcome, like the other servants.”\n\nCathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to\nembrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the\nsecond, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,\nexclaiming, “Why, how very black and cross you look! and how—how funny\nand grim! But that’s because I’m used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.\nWell, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?”\n\nShe had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw\ndouble gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.\n\n“Shake hands, Heathcliff,” said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; “once in\na way, that is permitted.”\n\n“I shall not,” replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; “I shall\nnot stand to be laughed at. I shall not bear it!”\n\nAnd he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him\nagain.\n\n“I did not mean to laugh at you,” she said; “I could not hinder myself:\nHeathcliff, shake hands at least! What are you sulky for? It was only\nthat you looked odd. If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will\nbe all right: but you are so dirty!”\n\nShe gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and\nalso at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from\nits contact with his.\n\n“You needn’t have touched me!” he answered, following her eye and\nsnatching away his hand. “I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like\nto be dirty, and I will be dirty.”\n\nWith that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of\nthe master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine;\nwho could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an\nexhibition of bad temper.\n\nAfter playing lady’s-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the\noven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,\nbefitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by\nsinging carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph’s affirmations that he\nconsidered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs. He had\nretired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw\nwere engaging Missy’s attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to\npresent to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.\nThey had invited them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the\ninvitation had been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that\nher darlings might be kept carefully apart from that “naughty swearing\nboy.”\n\nUnder these circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt the rich scent\nof the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the\npolished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready\nto be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless\npurity of my particular care—the scoured and well-swept floor. I gave\ndue inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old\nEarnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass,\nand slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I\nwent on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he\nshould suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally\nled me to consider the poor lad’s situation now, and from singing I\nchanged my mind to crying. It struck me soon, however, there would be\nmore sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding\ntears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek him. He was\nnot far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the\nstable, and feeding the other beasts, according to custom.\n\n“Make haste, Heathcliff!” I said, “the kitchen is so comfortable; and\nJoseph is upstairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss\nCathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth\nto yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.”\n\nHe proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me.\n\n“Come—are you coming?” I continued. “There’s a little cake for each of\nyou, nearly enough; and you’ll need half-an-hour’s donning.”\n\nI waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him. Catherine supped\nwith her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an\nunsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on\nthe other. His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the\nfairies. He managed to continue work till nine o’clock, and then\nmarched dumb and dour to his chamber. Cathy sat up late, having a world\nof things to order for the reception of her new friends: she came into\nthe kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only\nstayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went back. In the\nmorning he rose early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour\non to the moors; not re-appearing till the family were departed for\nchurch. Fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better\nspirit. He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his\ncourage, exclaimed abruptly—“Nelly, make me decent, I’m going to be\ngood.”\n\n“High time, Heathcliff,” I said; “you _have_ grieved Catherine: she’s\nsorry she ever came home, I daresay! It looks as if you envied her,\nbecause she is more thought of than you.”\n\nThe notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the\nnotion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.\n\n“Did she say she was grieved?” he inquired, looking very serious.\n\n“She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.”\n\n“Well, _I_ cried last night,” he returned, “and I had more reason to\ncry than she.”\n\n“Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an\nempty stomach,” said I. “Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.\nBut, if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind,\nwhen she comes in. You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say—you\nknow best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought\nher converted into a stranger by her grand dress. And now, though I\nhave dinner to get ready, I’ll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar\nLinton shall look quite a doll beside you: and that he does. You are\nyounger, and yet, I’ll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad\nacross the shoulders; you could knock him down in a twinkling; don’t\nyou feel that you could?”\n\nHeathcliff’s face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and\nhe sighed.\n\n“But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn’t make him\nless handsome or me more so. I wish I had light hair and a fair skin,\nand was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich\nas he will be!”\n\n“And cried for mamma at every turn,” I added, “and trembled if a\ncountry lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a\nshower of rain. Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit! Come to\nthe glass, and I’ll let you see what you should wish. Do you mark those\ntwo lines between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of\nrising arched, sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so\ndeeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting\nunder them, like devil’s spies? Wish and learn to smooth away the surly\nwrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to\nconfident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always\nseeing friends where they are not sure of foes. Don’t get the\nexpression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are\nits desert, and yet hates all the world, as well as the kicker, for\nwhat it suffers.”\n\n“In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton’s great blue eyes and\neven forehead,” he replied. “I do—and that won’t help me to them.”\n\n“A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,” I continued, “if\nyou were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into\nsomething worse than ugly. And now that we’ve done washing, and\ncombing, and sulking—tell me whether you don’t think yourself rather\nhandsome? I’ll tell you, I do. You’re fit for a prince in disguise. Who\nknows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian\nqueen, each of them able to buy up, with one week’s income, Wuthering\nHeights and Thrushcross Grange together? And you were kidnapped by\nwicked sailors and brought to England. Were I in your place, I would\nframe high notions of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should\ngive me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little\nfarmer!”\n\nSo I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to\nlook quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted\nby a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court. He ran\nto the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons\ndescend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the\nEarnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in\nwinter. Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them\ninto the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour\ninto their white faces.\n\nI urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he\nwillingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the\ndoor leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the\nother. They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and\ncheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved\nhim back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph “keep the fellow\nout of the room—send him into the garret till dinner is over. He’ll be\ncramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone\nwith them a minute.”\n\n“Nay, sir,” I could not avoid answering, “he’ll touch nothing, not he:\nand I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.”\n\n“He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till\ndark,” cried Hindley. “Begone, you vagabond! What! you are attempting\nthe coxcomb, are you? Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks—see\nif I won’t pull them a bit longer!”\n\n“They are long enough already,” observed Master Linton, peeping from\nthe doorway; “I wonder they don’t make his head ache. It’s like a\ncolt’s mane over his eyes!”\n\nHe ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but\nHeathcliff’s violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance\nof impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.\nHe seized a tureen of hot apple sauce, the first thing that came under\nhis gripe, and dashed it full against the speaker’s face and neck; who\ninstantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine\nhurrying to the place. Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly\nand conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a\nrough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and\nbreathless. I got the dish-cloth, and rather spitefully scrubbed\nEdgar’s nose and mouth, affirming it served him right for meddling. His\nsister began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded,\nblushing for all.\n\n“You should not have spoken to him!” she expostulated with Master\nLinton. “He was in a bad temper, and now you’ve spoilt your visit; and\nhe’ll be flogged: I hate him to be flogged! I can’t eat my dinner. Why\ndid you speak to him, Edgar?”\n\n“I didn’t,” sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the\nremainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief. “I\npromised mamma that I wouldn’t say one word to him, and I didn’t.”\n\n“Well, don’t cry,” replied Catherine, contemptuously; “you’re not\nkilled. Don’t make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet! Hush,\nIsabella! Has anybody hurt _you?_”\n\n“There, there, children—to your seats!” cried Hindley, bustling in.\n“That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely. Next time, Master Edgar,\ntake the law into your own fists—it will give you an appetite!”\n\nThe little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant\nfeast. They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no\nreal harm had befallen them. Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls,\nand the mistress made them merry with lively talk. I waited behind her\nchair, and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an\nindifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.\n“An unfeeling child,” I thought to myself; “how lightly she dismisses\nher old playmate’s troubles. I could not have imagined her to be so\nselfish.” She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down\nagain: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them. She slipped\nher fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her\nemotion. I did not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in\npurgatory throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of\ngetting by herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been\nlocked up by the master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce\nto him a private mess of victuals.\n\nIn the evening we had a dance. Cathy begged that he might be liberated\nthen, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and\nI was appointed to supply the deficiency. We got rid of all gloom in\nthe excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the\narrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a\ntrombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides\nsingers. They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive\ncontributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to\nhear them. After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs\nand glees. Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.\n\nCatherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of\nthe steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house\ndoor below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She\nmade no stay at the stairs’-head, but mounted farther, to the garret\nwhere Heathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined\nanswering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to\nhold communion with her through the boards. I let the poor things\nconverse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and\nthe singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to\nwarn her. Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The\nlittle monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof,\ninto the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I\ncould coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her,\nand she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my\nfellow-servant had gone to a neighbour’s, to be removed from the sound\nof our “devil’s psalmody,” as it pleased him to call it. I told them I\nintended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had\nnever broken his fast since yesterday’s dinner, I would wink at his\ncheating Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the\nfire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and\ncould eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He\nleant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands, and\nremained rapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his\nthoughts, he answered gravely—“I’m trying to settle how I shall pay\nHindley back. I don’t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at\nlast. I hope he will not die before I do!”\n\n“For shame, Heathcliff!” said I. “It is for God to punish wicked\npeople; we should learn to forgive.”\n\n“No, God won’t have the satisfaction that I shall,” he returned. “I\nonly wish I knew the best way! Let me alone, and I’ll plan it out:\nwhile I’m thinking of that I don’t feel pain.”\n\nBut, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you. I’m annoyed\nhow I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel\ncold, and you nodding for bed! I could have told Heathcliff’s history,\nall that you need hear, in half a dozen words.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay\naside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I\nwas very far from nodding. “Sit still, Mrs. Dean,” I cried; “do sit\nstill another half-hour. You’ve done just right to tell the story\nleisurely. That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the\nsame style. I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more\nor less.”\n\n“The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.”\n\n“No matter—I’m not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours. One or\ntwo is early enough for a person who lies till ten.”\n\n“You shouldn’t lie till ten. There’s the very prime of the morning gone\nlong before that time. A person who has not done one-half his day’s\nwork by ten o’clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.”\n\n“Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend\nlengthening the night till afternoon. I prognosticate for myself an\nobstinate cold, at least.”\n\n“I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to leap over some three\nyears; during that space Mrs. Earnshaw—”\n\n“No, no, I’ll allow nothing of the sort! Are you acquainted with the\nmood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking\nits kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so\nintently that puss’s neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of\ntemper?”\n\n“A terribly lazy mood, I should say.”\n\n“On the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine, at present; and,\ntherefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions\nacquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does\nover a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the\ndeepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the\nlooker-on. They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less\nin surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love\nfor life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love\nof a year’s standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to\na single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do\nit justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French\ncooks: he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but\neach part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.”\n\n“Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us,”\nobserved Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech.\n\n“Excuse me,” I responded; “you, my good friend, are a striking evidence\nagainst that assertion. Excepting a few provincialisms of slight\nconsequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to\nconsider as peculiar to your class. I am sure you have thought a great\ndeal more than the generality of servants think. You have been\ncompelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions\nfor frittering your life away in silly trifles.”\n\nMrs. Dean laughed.\n\n“I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,” she\nsaid; “not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of\nfaces, and one series of actions, from year’s end to year’s end; but I\nhave undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then,\nI have read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood. You could not open\na book in this library that I have not looked into, and got something\nout of also: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of\nFrench; and those I know one from another: it is as much as you can\nexpect of a poor man’s daughter. However, if I am to follow my story in\ntrue gossip’s fashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three\nyears, I will be content to pass to the next summer—the summer of 1778,\nthat is nearly twenty-three years ago.”\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOn the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and\nthe last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born. We were busy with the\nhay in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our\nbreakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the\nlane, calling me as she ran.\n\n“Oh, such a grand bairn!” she panted out. “The finest lad that ever\nbreathed! But the doctor says missis must go: he says she’s been in a\nconsumption these many months. I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now\nshe has nothing to keep her, and she’ll be dead before winter. You must\ncome home directly. You’re to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar\nand milk, and take care of it day and night. I wish I were you, because\nit will be all yours when there is no missis!”\n\n“But is she very ill?” I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my\nbonnet.\n\n“I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,” replied the girl, “and she\ntalks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man. She’s out of\nher head for joy, it’s such a beauty! If I were her I’m certain I\nshould not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite\nof Kenneth. I was fairly mad at him. Dame Archer brought the cherub\ndown to master, in the house, and his face just began to light up, when\nthe old croaker steps forward, and says he—‘Earnshaw, it’s a blessing\nyour wife has been spared to leave you this son. When she came, I felt\nconvinced we shouldn’t keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the\nwinter will probably finish her. Don’t take on, and fret about it too\nmuch: it can’t be helped. And besides, you should have known better\nthan to choose such a rush of a lass!’”\n\n“And what did the master answer?” I inquired.\n\n“I think he swore: but I didn’t mind him, I was straining to see the\nbairn,” and she began again to describe it rapturously. I, as zealous\nas herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was\nvery sad for Hindley’s sake. He had room in his heart only for two\nidols—his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I\ncouldn’t conceive how he would bear the loss.\n\nWhen we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door;\nand, as I passed in, I asked, “how was the baby?”\n\n“Nearly ready to run about, Nell!” he replied, putting on a cheerful\nsmile.\n\n“And the mistress?” I ventured to inquire; “the doctor says she’s—”\n\n“Damn the doctor!” he interrupted, reddening. “Frances is quite right:\nshe’ll be perfectly well by this time next week. Are you going\nupstairs? will you tell her that I’ll come, if she’ll promise not to\ntalk. I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she\nmust—tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.”\n\nI delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty\nspirits, and replied merrily, “I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there\nhe has gone out twice, crying. Well, say I promise I won’t speak: but\nthat does not bind me not to laugh at him!”\n\nPoor soul! Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed\nher; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming\nher health improved every day. When Kenneth warned him that his\nmedicines were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn’t put\nhim to further expense by attending her, he retorted, “I know you need\nnot—she’s well—she does not want any more attendance from you! She\nnever was in a consumption. It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse\nis as slow as mine now, and her cheek as cool.”\n\nHe told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one\nnight, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought\nshe should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her—a\nvery slight one—he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about\nhis neck, her face changed, and she was dead.\n\nAs the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my\nhands. Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him\ncry, was contented, as far as regarded him. For himself, he grew\ndesperate: his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament. He neither\nwept nor prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave\nhimself up to reckless dissipation. The servants could not bear his\ntyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that\nwould stay. I had not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you\nknow, I had been his foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more\nreadily than a stranger would. Joseph remained to hector over tenants\nand labourers; and because it was his vocation to be where he had\nplenty of wickedness to reprove.\n\nThe master’s bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for\nCatherine and Heathcliff. His treatment of the latter was enough to\nmake a fiend of a saint. And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_\npossessed of something diabolical at that period. He delighted to\nwitness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily\nmore notable for savage sullenness and ferocity. I could not half tell\nwhat an infernal house we had. The curate dropped calling, and nobody\ndecent came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton’s visits to Miss\nCathy might be an exception. At fifteen she was the queen of the\ncountry-side; she had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty,\nheadstrong creature! I own I did not like her, after infancy was past;\nand I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she\nnever took an aversion to me, though. She had a wondrous constancy to\nold attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections\nunalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it\ndifficult to make an equally deep impression. He was my late master:\nthat is his portrait over the fireplace. It used to hang on one side,\nand his wife’s on the other; but hers has been removed, or else you\nmight see something of what she was. Can you make that out?\n\nMrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face,\nexceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive\nand amiable in expression. It formed a sweet picture. The long light\nhair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious;\nthe figure almost too graceful. I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw\ncould forget her first friend for such an individual. I marvelled much\nhow he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea\nof Catherine Earnshaw.\n\n“A very agreeable portrait,” I observed to the house-keeper. “Is it\nlike?”\n\n“Yes,” she answered; “but he looked better when he was animated; that\nis his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.”\n\nCatherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her\nfive-weeks’ residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show\nher rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of\nbeing rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed\nunwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality;\ngained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her\nbrother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first—for she was\nfull of ambition—and led her to adopt a double character without\nexactly intending to deceive any one. In the place where she heard\nHeathcliff termed a “vulgar young ruffian,” and “worse than a brute,”\nshe took care not to act like him; but at home she had small\ninclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and\nrestrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor\npraise.\n\nMr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly. He\nhad a terror of Earnshaw’s reputation, and shrunk from encountering\nhim; and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility:\nthe master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if\nhe could not be gracious, kept out of the way. I rather think his\nappearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful,\nnever played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two\nfriends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of\nLinton in his presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his\nabsence; and when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff,\nshe dared not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if\ndepreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.\nI’ve had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles, which\nshe vainly strove to hide from my mockery. That sounds ill-natured: but\nshe was so proud, it became really impossible to pity her distresses,\ntill she should be chastened into more humility. She did bring herself,\nfinally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not a soul else\nthat she might fashion into an adviser.\n\nMr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed\nto give himself a holiday on the strength of it. He had reached the age\nof sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being\ndeficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward\nand outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.\nIn the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early\neducation: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had\nextinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge,\nand any love for books or learning. His childhood’s sense of\nsuperiority, instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was\nfaded away. He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in\nher studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he\nyielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step\nin the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink\nbeneath his former level. Then personal appearance sympathised with\nmental deterioration: he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look;\nhis naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost\nidiotic excess of unsociable moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure,\napparently, in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few\nacquaintance.\n\nCatherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of\nrespite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her\nin words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses,\nas if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks\nof affection on him. On the before-named occasion he came into the\nhouse to announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting\nMiss Cathy to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it\ninto his head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place\nto herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her\nbrother’s absence, and was then preparing to receive him.\n\n“Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?” asked Heathcliff. “Are you going\nanywhere?”\n\n“No, it is raining,” she answered.\n\n“Why have you that silk frock on, then?” he said. “Nobody coming here,\nI hope?”\n\n“Not that I know of,” stammered Miss: “but you should be in the field\nnow, Heathcliff. It is an hour past dinner time; I thought you were\ngone.”\n\n“Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,” observed\nthe boy. “I’ll not work any more to-day: I’ll stay with you.”\n\n“Oh, but Joseph will tell,” she suggested; “you’d better go!”\n\n“Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will\ntake him till dark, and he’ll never know.”\n\nSo saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down. Catherine reflected\nan instant, with knitted brows—she found it needful to smooth the way\nfor an intrusion. “Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this\nafternoon,” she said, at the conclusion of a minute’s silence. “As it\nrains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run\nthe risk of being scolded for no good.”\n\n“Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,” he persisted; “don’t turn\nme out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours! I’m on the point,\nsometimes, of complaining that they—but I’ll not—”\n\n“That they what?” cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled\ncountenance. “Oh, Nelly!” she added petulantly, jerking her head away\nfrom my hands, “you’ve combed my hair quite out of curl! That’s enough;\nlet me alone. What are you on the point of complaining about,\nHeathcliff?”\n\n“Nothing—only look at the almanack on that wall;” he pointed to a\nframed sheet hanging near the window, and continued, “The crosses are\nfor the evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those\nspent with me. Do you see? I’ve marked every day.”\n\n“Yes—very foolish: as if I took notice!” replied Catherine, in a\npeevish tone. “And where is the sense of that?”\n\n“To show that I _do_ take notice,” said Heathcliff.\n\n“And should I always be sitting with you?” she demanded, growing more\nirritated. “What good do I get? What do you talk about? You might be\ndumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you\ndo, either!”\n\n“You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you\ndisliked my company, Cathy!” exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.\n\n“It’s no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,” she\nmuttered.\n\nHer companion rose up, but he hadn’t time to express his feelings\nfurther, for a horse’s feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked\ngently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the\nunexpected summons he had received. Doubtless Catherine marked the\ndifference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.\nThe contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal\ncountry for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were\nas opposite as his aspect. He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and\npronounced his words as you do: that’s less gruff than we talk here,\nand softer.\n\n“I’m not come too soon, am I?” he said, casting a look at me: I had\nbegun to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the\ndresser.\n\n“No,” answered Catherine. “What are you doing there, Nelly?”\n\n“My work, Miss,” I replied. (Mr. Hindley had given me directions to\nmake a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.)\n\nShe stepped behind me and whispered crossly, “Take yourself and your\ndusters off; when company are in the house, servants don’t commence\nscouring and cleaning in the room where they are!”\n\n“It’s a good opportunity, now that master is away,” I answered aloud:\n“he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence. I’m\nsure Mr. Edgar will excuse me.”\n\n“I hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence,” exclaimed the young lady\nimperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to\nrecover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.\n\n“I’m sorry for it, Miss Catherine,” was my response; and I proceeded\nassiduously with my occupation.\n\nShe, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my\nhand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the\narm. I’ve said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her\nvanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up\nfrom my knees, and screamed out, “Oh, Miss, that’s a nasty trick! You\nhave no right to nip me, and I’m not going to bear it.”\n\n“I didn’t touch you, you lying creature!” cried she, her fingers\ntingling to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage. She never had\npower to conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a\nblaze.\n\n“What’s that, then?” I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to\nrefute her.\n\nShe stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled\nby the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging\nblow that filled both eyes with water.\n\n“Catherine, love! Catherine!” interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the\ndouble fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.\n\n“Leave the room, Ellen!” she repeated, trembling all over.\n\nLittle Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on\nthe floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out\ncomplaints against “wicked aunt Cathy,” which drew her fury on to his\nunlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor\nchild waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to\ndeliver him. In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young\nman felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be\nmistaken for jest. He drew back in consternation. I lifted Hareton in\nmy arms, and walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of\ncommunication open, for I was curious to watch how they would settle\ntheir disagreement. The insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had\nlaid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip.\n\n“That’s right!” I said to myself. “Take warning and begone! It’s a\nkindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.”\n\n“Where are you going?” demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.\n\nHe swerved aside, and attempted to pass.\n\n“You must not go!” she exclaimed, energetically.\n\n“I must and shall!” he replied in a subdued voice.\n\n“No,” she persisted, grasping the handle; “not yet, Edgar Linton: sit\ndown; you shall not leave me in that temper. I should be miserable all\nnight, and I won’t be miserable for you!”\n\n“Can I stay after you have struck me?” asked Linton.\n\nCatherine was mute.\n\n“You’ve made me afraid and ashamed of you,” he continued; “I’ll not\ncome here again!”\n\nHer eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.\n\n“And you told a deliberate untruth!” he said.\n\n“I didn’t!” she cried, recovering her speech; “I did nothing\ndeliberately. Well, go, if you please—get away! And now I’ll cry—I’ll\ncry myself sick!”\n\nShe dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious\nearnest. Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there\nhe lingered. I resolved to encourage him.\n\n“Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,” I called out. “As bad as any marred\nchild: you’d better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to\ngrieve us.”\n\nThe soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the\npower to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse\nhalf killed, or a bird half eaten. Ah, I thought, there will be no\nsaving him: he’s doomed, and flies to his fate! And so it was: he\nturned abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind\nhim; and when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had\ncome home rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears\n(his ordinary frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had\nmerely effected a closer intimacy—had broken the outworks of youthful\ntimidity, and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and\nconfess themselves lovers.\n\nIntelligence of Mr. Hindley’s arrival drove Linton speedily to his\nhorse, and Catherine to her chamber. I went to hide little Hareton, and\nto take the shot out of the master’s fowling-piece, which he was fond\nof playing with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of\nany who provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit\nupon the plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did\ngo the length of firing the gun.\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nHe entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the\nact of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was\nimpressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild\nbeast’s fondness or his madman’s rage; for in one he ran a chance of\nbeing squeezed and kissed to death, and in the other of being flung\ninto the fire, or dashed against the wall; and the poor thing remained\nperfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him.\n\n“There, I’ve found it out at last!” cried Hindley, pulling me back by\nthe skin of my neck, like a dog. “By heaven and hell, you’ve sworn\nbetween you to murder that child! I know how it is, now, that he is\nalways out of my way. But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you\nswallow the carving-knife, Nelly! You needn’t laugh; for I’ve just\ncrammed Kenneth, head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is\nthe same as one—and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest\ntill I do!”\n\n“But I don’t like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,” I answered; “it has\nbeen cutting red herrings. I’d rather be shot, if you please.”\n\n“You’d rather be damned!” he said; “and so you shall. No law in England\ncan hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine’s abominable!\nOpen your mouth.”\n\nHe held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point between my teeth:\nbut, for my part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries. I spat out,\nand affirmed it tasted detestably—I would not take it on any account.\n\n“Oh!” said he, releasing me, “I see that hideous little villain is not\nHareton: I beg your pardon, Nell. If it be, he deserves flaying alive\nfor not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.\nUnnatural cub, come hither! I’ll teach thee to impose on a\ngood-hearted, deluded father. Now, don’t you think the lad would be\nhandsomer cropped? It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something\nfierce—get me a scissors—something fierce and trim! Besides, it’s\ninfernal affectation—devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears—we’re\nasses enough without them. Hush, child, hush! Well then, it is my\ndarling! wisht, dry thy eyes—there’s a joy; kiss me. What! it won’t?\nKiss me, Hareton! Damn thee, kiss me! By God, as if I would rear such a\nmonster! As sure as I’m living, I’ll break the brat’s neck.”\n\nPoor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father’s arms with all\nhis might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and\nlifted him over the banister. I cried out that he would frighten the\nchild into fits, and ran to rescue him. As I reached them, Hindley\nleant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below; almost\nforgetting what he had in his hands. “Who is that?” he asked, hearing\nsome one approaching the stairs’-foot. I leant forward also, for the\npurpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come\nfurther; and, at the instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a\nsudden spring, delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him,\nand fell.\n\nThere was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw\nthat the little wretch was safe. Heathcliff arrived underneath just at\nthe critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and\nsetting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the\naccident. A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five\nshillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand\npounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding\nthe figure of Mr. Earnshaw above. It expressed, plainer than words\ncould do, the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument\nof thwarting his own revenge. Had it been dark, I daresay he would have\ntried to remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton’s skull on the steps;\nbut, we witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my\nprecious charge pressed to my heart. Hindley descended more leisurely,\nsobered and abashed.\n\n“It is your fault, Ellen,” he said; “you should have kept him out of\nsight: you should have taken him from me! Is he injured anywhere?”\n\n“Injured!” I cried angrily; “if he is not killed, he’ll be an idiot!\nOh! I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use\nhim. You’re worse than a heathen—treating your own flesh and blood in\nthat manner!”\n\nHe attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with me,\nsobbed off his terror directly. At the first finger his father laid on\nhim, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as if\nhe would go into convulsions.\n\n“You shall not meddle with him!” I continued. “He hates you—they all\nhate you—that’s the truth! A happy family you have; and a pretty state\nyou’re come to!”\n\n“I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,” laughed the misguided man,\nrecovering his hardness. “At present, convey yourself and him away. And\nhark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing. I\nwouldn’t murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire:\nbut that’s as my fancy goes.”\n\nWhile saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and\npoured some into a tumbler.\n\n“Nay, don’t!” I entreated. “Mr. Hindley, do take warning. Have mercy on\nthis unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!”\n\n“Any one will do better for him than I shall,” he answered.\n\n“Have mercy on your own soul!” I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass\nfrom his hand.\n\n“Not I! On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to\nperdition to punish its Maker,” exclaimed the blasphemer. “Here’s to\nits hearty damnation!”\n\nHe drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his\ncommand with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or\nremember.\n\n“It’s a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,” observed Heathcliff,\nmuttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut. “He’s doing\nhis very utmost; but his constitution defies him. Mr. Kenneth says he\nwould wager his mare that he’ll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton,\nand go to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the\ncommon course befall him.”\n\nI went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.\nHeathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn. It turned out\nafterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when\nhe flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire, and\nremained silent.\n\nI was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began,—\n\nIt was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,\nThe mither beneath the mools heard that,\n\nwhen Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her\nhead in, and whispered,—“Are you alone, Nelly?”\n\n“Yes, Miss,” I replied.\n\nShe entered and approached the hearth. I, supposing she was going to\nsay something, looked up. The expression of her face seemed disturbed\nand anxious. Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and\nshe drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence. I\nresumed my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour.\n\n“Where’s Heathcliff?” she said, interrupting me.\n\n“About his work in the stable,” was my answer.\n\nHe did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze. There\nfollowed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two\ntrickle from Catherine’s cheek to the flags. Is she sorry for her\nshameful conduct?—I asked myself. That will be a novelty: but she may\ncome to the point as she will—I sha’n’t help her! No, she felt small\ntrouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns.\n\n“Oh, dear!” she cried at last. “I’m very unhappy!”\n\n“A pity,” observed I. “You’re hard to please; so many friends and so\nfew cares, and can’t make yourself content!”\n\n“Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?” she pursued, kneeling down by\nme, and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look\nwhich turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the\nworld to indulge it.\n\n“Is it worth keeping?” I inquired, less sulkily.\n\n“Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out! I want to know what I\nshould do. To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I’ve\ngiven him an answer. Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or\ndenial, you tell me which it ought to have been.”\n\n“Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?” I replied. “To be sure,\nconsidering the exhibition you performed in his presence this\nafternoon, I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked\nyou after that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome\nfool.”\n\n“If you talk so, I won’t tell you any more,” she returned, peevishly\nrising to her feet. “I accepted him, Nelly. Be quick, and say whether I\nwas wrong!”\n\n“You accepted him! Then what good is it discussing the matter? You have\npledged your word, and cannot retract.”\n\n“But say whether I should have done so—do!” she exclaimed in an\nirritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning.\n\n“There are many things to be considered before that question can be\nanswered properly,” I said, sententiously. “First and foremost, do you\nlove Mr. Edgar?”\n\n“Who can help it? Of course I do,” she answered.\n\nThen I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of\ntwenty-two it was not injudicious.\n\n“Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?”\n\n“Nonsense, I do—that’s sufficient.”\n\n“By no means; you must say why?”\n\n“Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.”\n\n“Bad!” was my commentary.\n\n“And because he is young and cheerful.”\n\n“Bad, still.”\n\n“And because he loves me.”\n\n“Indifferent, coming there.”\n\n“And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the\nneighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.”\n\n“Worst of all. And now, say how you love him?”\n\n“As everybody loves—You’re silly, Nelly.”\n\n“Not at all—Answer.”\n\n“I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and\neverything he touches, and every word he says. I love all his looks,\nand all his actions, and him entirely and altogether. There now!”\n\n“And why?”\n\n“Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured! It’s\nno jest to me!” said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to\nthe fire.\n\n“I’m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,” I replied. “You love Mr.\nEdgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and\nloves you. The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him\nwithout that, probably; and with it you wouldn’t, unless he possessed\nthe four former attractions.”\n\n“No, to be sure not: I should only pity him—hate him, perhaps, if he\nwere ugly, and a clown.”\n\n“But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world:\nhandsomer, possibly, and richer than he is. What should hinder you from\nloving them?”\n\n“If there be any, they are out of my way: I’ve seen none like Edgar.”\n\n“You may see some; and he won’t always be handsome, and young, and may\nnot always be rich.”\n\n“He is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would\nspeak rationally.”\n\n“Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry\nMr. Linton.”\n\n“I don’t want your permission for that—I _shall_ marry him: and yet you\nhave not told me whether I’m right.”\n\n“Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present. And\nnow, let us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be\npleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will\nescape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable\none; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. All seems smooth and\neasy: where is the obstacle?”\n\n“_Here_! and _here_!” replied Catherine, striking one hand on her\nforehead, and the other on her breast: “in whichever place the soul\nlives. In my soul and in my heart, I’m convinced I’m wrong!”\n\n“That’s very strange! I cannot make it out.”\n\n“It’s my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I’ll explain it: I\ncan’t do it distinctly; but I’ll give you a feeling of how I feel.”\n\nShe seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver,\nand her clasped hands trembled.\n\n“Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?” she said, suddenly, after\nsome minutes’ reflection.\n\n“Yes, now and then,” I answered.\n\n“And so do I. I’ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me\never after, and changed my ideas: they’ve gone through and through me,\nlike wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is\none: I’m going to tell it—but take care not to smile at any part of\nit.”\n\n“Oh! don’t, Miss Catherine!” I cried. “We’re dismal enough without\nconjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us. Come, come, be merry and\nlike yourself! Look at little Hareton! _he’s_ dreaming nothing dreary.\nHow sweetly he smiles in his sleep!”\n\n“Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude! You remember\nhim, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing:\nnearly as young and innocent. However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to\nlisten: it’s not long; and I’ve no power to be merry to-night.”\n\n“I won’t hear it, I won’t hear it!” I repeated, hastily.\n\nI was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had\nan unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which\nI might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe. She was\nvexed, but she did not proceed. Apparently taking up another subject,\nshe recommenced in a short time.\n\n“If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.”\n\n“Because you are not fit to go there,” I answered. “All sinners would\nbe miserable in heaven.”\n\n“But it is not for that. I dreamt once that I was there.”\n\n“I tell you I won’t hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I’ll go to\nbed,” I interrupted again.\n\nShe laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair.\n\n“This is nothing,” cried she: “I was only going to say that heaven did\nnot seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back\nto earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the\nmiddle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke\nsobbing for joy. That will do to explain my secret, as well as the\nother. I’ve no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in\nheaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so\nlow, I shouldn’t have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry\nHeathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not\nbecause he’s handsome, Nelly, but because he’s more myself than I am.\nWhatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton’s\nis as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.”\n\nEre this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff’s presence.\nHaving noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise\nfrom the bench, and steal out noiselessly. He had listened till he\nheard Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he\nstayed to hear no further. My companion, sitting on the ground, was\nprevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or\ndeparture; but I started, and bade her hush!\n\n“Why?” she asked, gazing nervously round.\n\n“Joseph is here,” I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his\ncartwheels up the road; “and Heathcliff will come in with him. I’m not\nsure whether he were not at the door this moment.”\n\n“Oh, he couldn’t overhear me at the door!” said she. “Give me Hareton,\nwhile you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.\nI want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that\nHeathcliff has no notion of these things. He has not, has he? He does\nnot know what being in love is!”\n\n“I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,” I returned;\n“and if _you_ are his choice, he’ll be the most unfortunate creature\nthat ever was born! As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend,\nand love, and all! Have you considered how you’ll bear the separation,\nand how he’ll bear to be quite deserted in the world? Because, Miss\nCatherine—”\n\n“He quite deserted! we separated!” she exclaimed, with an accent of\nindignation. “Who is to separate us, pray? They’ll meet the fate of\nMilo! Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature. Every\nLinton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could\nconsent to forsake Heathcliff. Oh, that’s not what I intend—that’s not\nwhat I mean! I shouldn’t be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!\nHe’ll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime. Edgar must\nshake off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least. He will, when he\nlearns my true feelings towards him. Nelly, I see now you think me a\nselfish wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I\nmarried, we should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid\nHeathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother’s power.”\n\n“With your husband’s money, Miss Catherine?” I asked. “You’ll find him\nnot so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I’m hardly a judge, I\nthink that’s the worst motive you’ve given yet for being the wife of\nyoung Linton.”\n\n“It is not,” retorted she; “it is the best! The others were the\nsatisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar’s sake, too, to satisfy him.\nThis is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings\nto Edgar and myself. I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody\nhave a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond\nyou. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained\nhere? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff’s miseries,\nand I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in\nliving is himself. If all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should\nstill continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were\nannihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not\nseem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods:\ntime will change it, I’m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My\nlove for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of\nlittle visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff! He’s\nalways, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always\na pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don’t talk of our\nseparation again: it is impracticable; and—”\n\nShe paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it\nforcibly away. I was out of patience with her folly!\n\n“If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,” I said, “it only goes\nto convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in\nmarrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl. But trouble\nme with no more secrets: I’ll not promise to keep them.”\n\n“You’ll keep that?” she asked, eagerly.\n\n“No, I’ll not promise,” I repeated.\n\nShe was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our\nconversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed\nHareton, while I made the supper. After it was cooked, my\nfellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr.\nHindley; and we didn’t settle it till all was nearly cold. Then we came\nto the agreement that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we\nfeared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time\nalone.\n\n“And how isn’t that nowt comed in fro’ th’ field, be this time? What is\nhe about? girt idle seeght!” demanded the old man, looking round for\nHeathcliff.\n\n“I’ll call him,” I replied. “He’s in the barn, I’ve no doubt.”\n\nI went and called, but got no answer. On returning, I whispered to\nCatherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure;\nand told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her\nbrother’s conduct regarding him. She jumped up in a fine fright, flung\nHareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not\ntaking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk\nwould have affected him. She was absent such a while that Joseph\nproposed we should wait no longer. He cunningly conjectured they were\nstaying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing. They\nwere “ill eneugh for ony fahl manners,” he affirmed. And on their\nbehalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual\nquarter-of-an-hour’s supplication before meat, and would have tacked\nanother to the end of the grace, had not his young mistress broken in\nupon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road, and,\nwherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and make him re-enter directly!\n\n“I want to speak to him, and I _must_, before I go upstairs,” she said.\n“And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not\nreply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.”\n\nJoseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to\nsuffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and\nwalked grumbling forth. Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the\nfloor, exclaiming—“I wonder where he is—I wonder where he _can_ be!\nWhat did I say, Nelly? I’ve forgotten. Was he vexed at my bad humour\nthis afternoon? Dear! tell me what I’ve said to grieve him? I do wish\nhe’d come. I do wish he would!”\n\n“What a noise for nothing!” I cried, though rather uneasy myself. “What\na trifle scares you! It’s surely no great cause of alarm that\nHeathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie\ntoo sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft. I’ll engage he’s lurking\nthere. See if I don’t ferret him out!”\n\nI departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and\nJoseph’s quest ended in the same.\n\n“Yon lad gets war und war!” observed he on re-entering. “He’s left th’\ngate at t’ full swing, and Miss’s pony has trodden dahn two rigs o’\ncorn, and plottered through, raight o’er into t’ meadow! Hahsomdiver,\nt’ maister ’ull play t’ devil to-morn, and he’ll do weel. He’s patience\nitsseln wi’ sich careless, offald craters—patience itsseln he is! Bud\nhe’ll not be soa allus—yah’s see, all on ye! Yah mun’n’t drive him out\nof his heead for nowt!”\n\n“Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?” interrupted Catherine. “Have you\nbeen looking for him, as I ordered?”\n\n“I sud more likker look for th’ horse,” he replied. “It ’ud be to more\nsense. Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike\nthis—as black as t’ chimbley! und Heathcliff’s noan t’ chap to coom at\n_my_ whistle—happen he’ll be less hard o’ hearing wi’ _ye_!”\n\nIt _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined\nto thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain\nwould be certain to bring him home without further trouble. However,\nCatherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity. She kept wandering\nto and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which\npermitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one\nside of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations\nand the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash\naround her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and\nthen crying outright. She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good\npassionate fit of crying.\n\nAbout midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the\nHeights in full fury. There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and\neither one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building:\na huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the\neast chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the\nkitchen-fire. We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and\nJoseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the\npatriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,\nthough he smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must be a\njudgment on us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I\nshook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet\nliving. He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion\nvociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might\nbe drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master. But\nthe uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed;\nexcepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in\nrefusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to\ncatch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes. She came in\nand lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to\nthe back, and putting her hands before it.\n\n“Well, Miss!” I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; “you are not bent on\ngetting your death, are you? Do you know what o’clock it is? Half-past\ntwelve. Come, come to bed! there’s no use waiting any longer on that\nfoolish boy: he’ll be gone to Gimmerton, and he’ll stay there now. He\nguesses we shouldn’t wait for him till this late hour: at least, he\nguesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he’d rather avoid having\nthe door opened by the master.”\n\n“Nay, nay, he’s noan at Gimmerton,” said Joseph. “I’s niver wonder but\nhe’s at t’ bothom of a bog-hoile. This visitation worn’t for nowt, and\nI wod hev’ ye to look out, Miss—yah muh be t’ next. Thank Hivin for\nall! All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out\nfro’ th’ rubbidge! Yah knaw whet t’ Scripture ses.” And he began\nquoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we\nmight find them.\n\nI, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet\nthings, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed\nwith little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping\nround him. I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I\ndistinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.\n\nComing down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing\nthe chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the\nfireplace. The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its\nunclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen\nhearth, haggard and drowsy.\n\n“What ails you, Cathy?” he was saying when I entered: “you look as\ndismal as a drowned whelp. Why are you so damp and pale, child?”\n\n“I’ve been wet,” she answered reluctantly, “and I’m cold, that’s all.”\n\n“Oh, she is naughty!” I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably\nsober. “She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there\nshe has sat the night through, and I couldn’t prevail on her to stir.”\n\nMr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise. “The night through,” he\nrepeated. “What kept her up? not fear of the thunder, surely? That was\nover hours since.”\n\nNeither of us wished to mention Heathcliff’s absence, as long as we\ncould conceal it; so I replied, I didn’t know how she took it into her\nhead to sit up; and she said nothing. The morning was fresh and cool; I\nthrew back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents\nfrom the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, “Ellen, shut the\nwindow. I’m starving!” And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to\nthe almost extinguished embers.\n\n“She’s ill,” said Hindley, taking her wrist; “I suppose that’s the\nreason she would not go to bed. Damn it! I don’t want to be troubled\nwith more sickness here. What took you into the rain?”\n\n“Running after t’ lads, as usuald!” croaked Joseph, catching an\nopportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue. “If I war\nyah, maister, I’d just slam t’ boards i’ their faces all on ’em, gentle\nand simple! Never a day ut yah’re off, but yon cat o’ Linton comes\nsneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo’s a fine lass! shoo sits watching\nfor ye i’ t’ kitchen; and as yah’re in at one door, he’s out at\nt’other; and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting of her side! It’s\nbonny behaviour, lurking amang t’ fields, after twelve o’ t’ night, wi’\nthat fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff! They think _I’m_\nblind; but I’m noan: nowt ut t’ soart!—I seed young Linton boath coming\nand going, and I seed _yah_” (directing his discourse to me), “yah\ngooid fur nowt, slattenly witch! nip up and bolt into th’ house, t’\nminute yah heard t’ maister’s horse-fit clatter up t’ road.”\n\n“Silence, eavesdropper!” cried Catherine; “none of your insolence\nbefore me! Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was\n_I_ who told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have\nmet him as you were.”\n\n“You lie, Cathy, no doubt,” answered her brother, “and you are a\nconfounded simpleton! But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were\nyou not with Heathcliff last night? Speak the truth, now. You need not\nbe afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me\na good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of\nbreaking his neck. To prevent it, I shall send him about his business\nthis very morning; and after he’s gone, I’d advise you all to look\nsharp: I shall only have the more humour for you.”\n\n“I never saw Heathcliff last night,” answered Catherine, beginning to\nsob bitterly: “and if you do turn him out of doors, I’ll go with him.\nBut, perhaps, you’ll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he’s gone.”\nHere she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her\nwords were inarticulate.\n\nHindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get\nto her room immediately, or she shouldn’t cry for nothing! I obliged\nher to obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we\nreached her chamber: it terrified me. I thought she was going mad, and\nI begged Joseph to run for the doctor. It proved the commencement of\ndelirium: Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her\ndangerously ill; she had a fever. He bled her, and he told me to let\nher live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw\nherself downstairs or out of the window; and then he left: for he had\nenough to do in the parish, where two or three miles was the ordinary\ndistance between cottage and cottage.\n\nThough I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master\nwere no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong\nas a patient could be, she weathered it through. Old Mrs. Linton paid\nus several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded\nand ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted\non conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were\nvery grateful. But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness:\nshe and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of\neach other.\n\nOur young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and\nhaughtier than ever. Heathcliff had never been heard of since the\nevening of the thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when\nshe had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance\non her: where indeed it belonged, as she well knew. From that period,\nfor several months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save\nin the relation of a mere servant. Joseph fell under a ban also: he\n_would_ speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a\nlittle girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and\nthought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with\nconsideration. Then the doctor had said that she would not bear\ncrossing much; she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less\nthan murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and\ncontradict her. From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof;\nand tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often\nattended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to\ndemand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper. He was\nrather _too_ indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection,\nbut from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the\nfamily by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him\nalone she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared! Edgar\nLinton, as multitudes have been before and will be after him, was\ninfatuated: and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he\nled her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father’s\ndeath.\n\nMuch against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights\nand accompany her here. Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I\nhad just begun to teach him his letters. We made a sad parting; but\nCatherine’s tears were more powerful than ours. When I refused to go,\nand when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting\nto her husband and brother. The former offered me munificent wages; the\nlatter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said,\nnow that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should\ntake him in hand, by-and-by. And so I had but one choice left: to do as\nI was ordered. I told the master he got rid of all decent people only\nto run to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and\nsince then he has been a stranger: and it’s very queer to think it, but\nI’ve no doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and\nthat he was ever more than all the world to her and she to him!\n\n* * * * *\n\nAt this point of the housekeeper’s story she chanced to glance towards\nthe time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the\nminute-hand measure half-past one. She would not hear of staying a\nsecond longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of\nher narrative myself. And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I\nhave meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go\nalso, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nA charming introduction to a hermit’s life! Four weeks’ torture,\ntossing, and sickness! Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies,\nand impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons! And oh, this\ndearth of the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible\nintimation of Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till\nspring!\n\nMr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call. About seven days ago\nhe sent me a brace of grouse—the last of the season. Scoundrel! He is\nnot altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a\ngreat mind to tell him. But, alas! how could I offend a man who was\ncharitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some\nother subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches? This is\nquite an easy interval. I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could\nenjoy something interesting. Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her\ntale? I can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone. Yes:\nI remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three\nyears; and the heroine was married. I’ll ring: she’ll be delighted to\nfind me capable of talking cheerfully. Mrs. Dean came.\n\n“It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,” she commenced.\n\n“Away, away with it!” I replied; “I desire to have—”\n\n“The doctor says you must drop the powders.”\n\n“With all my heart! Don’t interrupt me. Come and take your seat here.\nKeep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials. Draw your knitting\nout of your pocket—that will do—now continue the history of Mr.\nHeathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day. Did he finish\nhis education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman? or did he\nget a sizar’s place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours\nby drawing blood from his foster-country? or make a fortune more\npromptly on the English highways?”\n\n“He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I\ncouldn’t give my word for any. I stated before that I didn’t know how\nhe gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise\nhis mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with\nyour leave, I’ll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse\nand not weary you. Are you feeling better this morning?”\n\n“Much.”\n\n“That’s good news.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nI got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my\nagreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to\nexpect. She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his\nsister she showed plenty of affection. They were both very attentive to\nher comfort, certainly. It was not the thorn bending to the\nhoneysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. There were no\nmutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who\n_can_ be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither\nopposition nor indifference? I observed that Mr. Edgar had a\ndeep-rooted fear of ruffling her humour. He concealed it from her; but\nif ever he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow\ncloudy at some imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble by a\nfrown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account. He many a\ntime spoke sternly to me about my pertness; and averred that the stab\nof a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing\nhis lady vexed. Not to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less\ntouchy; and, for the space of half a year, the gunpowder lay as\nharmless as sand, because no fire came near to explode it. Catherine\nhad seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected with\nsympathising silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an alteration\nin her constitution, produced by her perilous illness; as she was never\nsubject to depression of spirits before. The return of sunshine was\nwelcomed by answering sunshine from him. I believe I may assert that\nthey were really in possession of deep and growing happiness.\n\nIt ended. Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild\nand generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it\nended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one’s interest\nwas not the chief consideration in the other’s thoughts. On a mellow\nevening in September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket\nof apples which I had been gathering. It had got dusk, and the moon\nlooked over the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to\nlurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the\nbuilding. I set my burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and\nlingered to rest, and drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet\nair; my eyes were on the moon, and my back to the entrance, when I\nheard a voice behind me say,—“Nelly, is that you?”\n\nIt was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in\nthe manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar. I\nturned about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut,\nand I had seen nobody on approaching the steps. Something stirred in\nthe porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in\ndark clothes, with dark face and hair. He leant against the side, and\nheld his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself. “Who\ncan it be?” I thought. “Mr. Earnshaw? Oh, no! The voice has no\nresemblance to his.”\n\n“I have waited here an hour,” he resumed, while I continued staring;\n“and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death. I\ndared not enter. You do not know me? Look, I’m not a stranger!”\n\nA ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered\nwith black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and\nsingular. I remembered the eyes.\n\n“What!” I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor,\nand I raised my hands in amazement. “What! you come back? Is it really\nyou? Is it?”\n\n“Yes, Heathcliff,” he replied, glancing from me up to the windows,\nwhich reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from\nwithin. “Are they at home? where is she? Nelly, you are not glad! you\nneedn’t be so disturbed. Is she here? Speak! I want to have one word\nwith her—your mistress. Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires\nto see her.”\n\n“How will she take it?” I exclaimed. “What will she do? The surprise\nbewilders me—it will put her out of her head! And you _are_ Heathcliff!\nBut altered! Nay, there’s no comprehending it. Have you been for a\nsoldier?”\n\n“Go and carry my message,” he interrupted, impatiently. “I’m in hell\ntill you do!”\n\nHe lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where\nMr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed. At\nlength I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the\ncandles lighted, and I opened the door.\n\nThey sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,\nand displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the\nvalley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top\n(for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the\nsough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of\nthe glen). Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our\nold house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side. Both\nthe room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked\nwondrously peaceful. I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand;\nand was actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my\nquestion about the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to\nreturn, and mutter, “A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma’am.”\n\n“What does he want?” asked Mrs. Linton.\n\n“I did not question him,” I answered.\n\n“Well, close the curtains, Nelly,” she said; “and bring up tea. I’ll be\nback again directly.”\n\nShe quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.\n\n“Some one mistress does not expect,” I replied. “That Heathcliff—you\nrecollect him, sir—who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw’s.”\n\n“What! the gipsy—the ploughboy?” he cried. “Why did you not say so to\nCatherine?”\n\n“Hush! you must not call him by those names, master,” I said. “She’d be\nsadly grieved to hear you. She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.\nI guess his return will make a jubilee to her.”\n\nMr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that\noverlooked the court. He unfastened it, and leant out. I suppose they\nwere below, for he exclaimed quickly: “Don’t stand there, love! Bring\nthe person in, if it be anyone particular.” Ere long, I heard the click\nof the latch, and Catherine flew upstairs, breathless and wild; too\nexcited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have\nsurmised an awful calamity.\n\n“Oh, Edgar, Edgar!” she panted, flinging her arms round his neck. “Oh,\nEdgar darling! Heathcliff’s come back—he is!” And she tightened her\nembrace to a squeeze.\n\n“Well, well,” cried her husband, crossly, “don’t strangle me for that!\nHe never struck me as such a marvellous treasure. There is no need to\nbe frantic!”\n\n“I know you didn’t like him,” she answered, repressing a little the\nintensity of her delight. “Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.\nShall I tell him to come up?”\n\n“Here,” he said, “into the parlour?”\n\n“Where else?” she asked.\n\nHe looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for\nhim. Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression—half angry, half\nlaughing at his fastidiousness.\n\n“No,” she added, after a while; “I cannot sit in the kitchen. Set two\ntables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being\ngentry; the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.\nWill that please you, dear? Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere? If\nso, give directions. I’ll run down and secure my guest. I’m afraid the\njoy is too great to be real!”\n\nShe was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.\n\n“_You_ bid him step up,” he said, addressing me; “and, Catherine, try\nto be glad, without being absurd. The whole household need not witness\nthe sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.”\n\nI descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently\nanticipating an invitation to enter. He followed my guidance without\nwaste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and\nmistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking. But the\nlady’s glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the\ndoor: she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton;\nand then she seized Linton’s reluctant fingers and crushed them into\nhis. Now, fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed,\nmore than ever, to behold the transformation of Heathcliff. He had\ngrown a tall, athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed\nquite slender and youth-like. His upright carriage suggested the idea\nof his having been in the army. His countenance was much older in\nexpression and decision of feature than Mr. Linton’s; it looked\nintelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation. A\nhalf-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full\nof black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was even dignified:\nquite divested of roughness, though too stern for grace. My master’s\nsurprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss\nhow to address the ploughboy, as he had called him. Heathcliff dropped\nhis slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to\nspeak.\n\n“Sit down, sir,” he said, at length. “Mrs. Linton, recalling old times,\nwould have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am\ngratified when anything occurs to please her.”\n\n“And I also,” answered Heathcliff, “especially if it be anything in\nwhich I have a part. I shall stay an hour or two willingly.”\n\nHe took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if\nshe feared he would vanish were she to remove it. He did not raise his\nto her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed\nback, each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from\nhers. They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer\nembarrassment. Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a\nfeeling that reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across\nthe rug, seized Heathcliff’s hands again, and laughed like one beside\nherself.\n\n“I shall think it a dream to-morrow!” she cried. “I shall not be able\nto believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.\nAnd yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don’t deserve this welcome. To be absent\nand silent for three years, and never to think of me!”\n\n“A little more than you have thought of me,” he murmured. “I heard of\nyour marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard\nbelow, I meditated this plan—just to have one glimpse of your face, a\nstare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle\nmy score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on\nmyself. Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of\nmeeting me with another aspect next time! Nay, you’ll not drive me off\nagain. You were really sorry for me, were you? Well, there was cause.\nI’ve fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and\nyou must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!”\n\n“Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the\ntable,” interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and\na due measure of politeness. “Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk,\nwherever he may lodge to-night; and I’m thirsty.”\n\nShe took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by\nthe bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room.\nThe meal hardly endured ten minutes. Catherine’s cup was never filled:\nshe could neither eat nor drink. Edgar had made a slop in his saucer,\nand scarcely swallowed a mouthful. Their guest did not protract his\nstay that evening above an hour longer. I asked, as he departed, if he\nwent to Gimmerton?\n\n“No, to Wuthering Heights,” he answered: “Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when\nI called this morning.”\n\nMr. Earnshaw invited _him_! and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw! I pondered\nthis sentence painfully, after he was gone. Is he turning out a bit of\na hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a\ncloak? I mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he\nhad better have remained away.\n\nAbout the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs.\nLinton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and\npulling me by the hair to rouse me.\n\n“I cannot rest, Ellen,” she said, by way of apology. “And I want some\nliving creature to keep me company in my happiness! Edgar is sulky,\nbecause I’m glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to\nopen his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he\naffirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so\nsick and sleepy. He always contrives to be sick at the least cross! I\ngave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for\na headache or a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.”\n\n“What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?” I answered. “As lads they\nhad an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much\nto hear him praised: it’s human nature. Let Mr. Linton alone about him,\nunless you would like an open quarrel between them.”\n\n“But does it not show great weakness?” pursued she. “I’m not envious: I\nnever feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella’s yellow hair and the\nwhiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the\nfamily exhibit for her. Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute\nsometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish\nmother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good temper. It\npleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me. But they\nare very much alike: they are spoiled children, and fancy the world was\nmade for their accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart\nchastisement might improve them all the same.”\n\n“You’re mistaken, Mrs. Linton,” said I. “They humour you: I know what\nthere would be to do if they did not. You can well afford to indulge\ntheir passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your\ndesires. You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal\nconsequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very\ncapable of being as obstinate as you.”\n\n“And then we shall fight to the death, sha’n’t we, Nelly?” she\nreturned, laughing. “No! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton’s\nlove, that I believe I might kill him, and he wouldn’t wish to\nretaliate.”\n\nI advised her to value him the more for his affection.\n\n“I do,” she answered, “but he needn’t resort to whining for trifles. It\nis childish; and, instead of melting into tears because I said that\nHeathcliff was now worthy of anyone’s regard, and it would honour the\nfirst gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said\nit for me, and been delighted from sympathy. He must get accustomed to\nhim, and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason\nto object to him, I’m sure he behaved excellently!”\n\n“What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?” I inquired. “He\nis reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering\nthe right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!”\n\n“He explained it,” she replied. “I wonder as much as you. He said he\ncalled to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you\nresided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to\nquestioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living;\nand finally, desired him to walk in. There were some persons sitting at\ncards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and,\nfinding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again\nin the evening: to which he consented. Hindley is too reckless to\nselect his acquaintance prudently: he doesn’t trouble himself to\nreflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has\nbasely injured. But Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for\nresuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install\nhimself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange, and an\nattachment to the house where we lived together; and likewise a hope\nthat I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could\nhave if he settled in Gimmerton. He means to offer liberal payment for\npermission to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother’s\ncovetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always greedy;\nthough what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.”\n\n“It’s a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!” said I.\n“Have you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?”\n\n“None for my friend,” she replied: “his strong head will keep him from\ndanger; a little for Hindley: but he can’t be made morally worse than\nhe is; and I stand between him and bodily harm. The event of this\nevening has reconciled me to God and humanity! I had risen in angry\nrebellion against Providence. Oh, I’ve endured very, very bitter\nmisery, Nelly! If that creature knew how bitter, he’d be ashamed to\ncloud its removal with idle petulance. It was kindness for him which\ninduced me to bear it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently\nfelt, he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently\nas I. However, it’s over, and I’ll take no revenge on his folly; I can\nafford to suffer anything hereafter! Should the meanest thing alive\nslap me on the cheek, I’d not only turn the other, but I’d ask pardon\nfor provoking it; and, as a proof, I’ll go make my peace with Edgar\ninstantly. Good-night! I’m an angel!”\n\nIn this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her\nfulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only\nabjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by\nCatherine’s exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to\nher taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and\nshe rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in\nreturn as made the house a paradise for several days; both master and\nservants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.\n\nHeathcliff—Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future—used the liberty of\nvisiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed\nestimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion. Catherine, also,\ndeemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in\nreceiving him; and he gradually established his right to be expected.\nHe retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was\nremarkable; and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of\nfeeling. My master’s uneasiness experienced a lull, and further\ncircumstances diverted it into another channel for a space.\n\nHis new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of\nIsabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards\nthe tolerated guest. She was at that time a charming young lady of\neighteen; infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen\nfeelings, and a keen temper, too, if irritated. Her brother, who loved\nher tenderly, was appalled at this fantastic preference. Leaving aside\nthe degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible\nfact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into such\na one’s power, he had sense to comprehend Heathcliff’s disposition: to\nknow that, though his exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable\nand unchanged. And he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank\nforebodingly from the idea of committing Isabella to its keeping. He\nwould have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment\nrose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation\nof sentiment; for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the\nblame on Heathcliff’s deliberate designing.\n\nWe had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and\npined over something. She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and\nteasing Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her\nlimited patience. We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of\nill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes. But one day,\nwhen she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast,\ncomplaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the\nmistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar\nneglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left\nopen, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a\nhundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily\ninsisted that she should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily,\nthreatened to send for the doctor. Mention of Kenneth caused her to\nexclaim, instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only\nCatherine’s harshness which made her unhappy.\n\n“How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?” cried the mistress,\namazed at the unreasonable assertion. “You are surely losing your\nreason. When have I been harsh, tell me?”\n\n“Yesterday,” sobbed Isabella, “and now!”\n\n“Yesterday!” said her sister-in-law. “On what occasion?”\n\n“In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased,\nwhile you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!”\n\n“And that’s your notion of harshness?” said Catherine, laughing. “It\nwas no hint that your company was superfluous; we didn’t care whether\nyou kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff’s talk would have\nnothing entertaining for your ears.”\n\n“Oh, no,” wept the young lady; “you wished me away, because you knew I\nliked to be there!”\n\n“Is she sane?” asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me. “I’ll repeat our\nconversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it\ncould have had for you.”\n\n“I don’t mind the conversation,” she answered: “I wanted to be with—”\n\n“Well?” said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the\nsentence.\n\n“With him: and I won’t be always sent off!” she continued, kindling up.\n“You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but\nyourself!”\n\n“You are an impertinent little monkey!” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in\nsurprise. “But I’ll not believe this idiocy! It is impossible that you\ncan covet the admiration of Heathcliff—that you consider him an\nagreeable person! I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?”\n\n“No, you have not,” said the infatuated girl. “I love him more than\never you loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!”\n\n“I wouldn’t be you for a kingdom, then!” Catherine declared,\nemphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely. “Nelly, help me to\nconvince her of her madness. Tell her what Heathcliff is: an\nunreclaimed creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid\nwilderness of furze and whinstone. I’d as soon put that little canary\ninto the park on a winter’s day, as recommend you to bestow your heart\non him! It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing\nelse, which makes that dream enter your head. Pray, don’t imagine that\nhe conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern\nexterior! He’s not a rough diamond—a pearl-containing oyster of a\nrustic: he’s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man. I never say to him, ‘Let\nthis or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to\nharm them;’ I say, ‘Let them alone, because _I_ should hate them to be\nwronged:’ and he’d crush you like a sparrow’s egg, Isabella, if he\nfound you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn’t love a Linton; and\nyet he’d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations:\navarice is growing with him a besetting sin. There’s my picture: and\nI’m his friend—so much so, that had he thought seriously to catch you,\nI should, perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his\ntrap.”\n\nMiss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.\n\n“For shame! for shame!” she repeated, angrily. “You are worse than\ntwenty foes, you poisonous friend!”\n\n“Ah! you won’t believe me, then?” said Catherine. “You think I speak\nfrom wicked selfishness?”\n\n“I’m certain you do,” retorted Isabella; “and I shudder at you!”\n\n“Good!” cried the other. “Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I\nhave done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.”—\n\n“And I must suffer for her egotism!” she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left\nthe room. “All, all is against me: she has blighted my single\nconsolation. But she uttered falsehoods, didn’t she? Mr. Heathcliff is\nnot a fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he\nremember her?”\n\n“Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,” I said. “He’s a bird of bad\nomen: no mate for you. Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can’t\ncontradict her. She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any\none besides; and she never would represent him as worse than he is.\nHonest people don’t hide their deeds. How has he been living? how has\nhe got rich? why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man\nwhom he abhors? They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came.\nThey sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been\nborrowing money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink: I\nheard only a week ago—it was Joseph who told me—I met him at Gimmerton:\n‘Nelly,’ he said, ‘we’s hae a crowner’s ’quest enow, at ahr folks’. One\non ’em ’s a’most getten his finger cut off wi’ hauding t’ other fro’\nstickin’ hisseln loike a cawlf. That’s maister, yah knaw, ’at ’s soa\nup o’ going tuh t’ grand ’sizes. He’s noan feared o’ t’ bench o’\njudges, norther Paul, nur Peter, nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on\n’em, not he! He fair likes—he langs to set his brazened face agean ’em!\nAnd yon bonny lad Heathcliff, yah mind, he’s a rare ’un. He can girn a\nlaugh as well ’s onybody at a raight divil’s jest. Does he niver say\nnowt of his fine living amang us, when he goes to t’ Grange? This is t’\nway on ’t:—up at sun-down: dice, brandy, cloised shutters, und\ncan’le-light till next day at noon: then, t’ fooil gangs banning un\nraving to his cham’er, makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i’ thur\nlugs fur varry shame; un’ the knave, why he can caint his brass, un’\nate, un’ sleep, un’ off to his neighbour’s to gossip wi’ t’ wife. I’\ncourse, he tells Dame Catherine how her fathur’s goold runs into his\npocket, and her fathur’s son gallops down t’ broad road, while he flees\nafore to oppen t’ pikes!’ Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rascal,\nbut no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff’s conduct be true, you\nwould never think of desiring such a husband, would you?”\n\n“You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!” she replied. “I’ll not listen\nto your slanders. What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me\nthat there is no happiness in the world!”\n\nWhether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or\npersevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time\nto reflect. The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next\ntown; my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his\nabsence, called rather earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were\nsitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter\nalarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of\nher secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on\nmature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she\nlaughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter\nto _her_. She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was\nsweeping the hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips.\nIsabella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the\ndoor opened; and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would\ngladly have done had it been practicable.\n\n“Come in, that’s right!” exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair\nto the fire. “Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the\nice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.\nHeathcliff, I’m proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you\nmore than myself. I expect you to feel flattered. Nay, it’s not Nelly;\ndon’t look at her! My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart\nby mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty. It lies in\nyour own power to be Edgar’s brother! No, no, Isabella, you sha’n’t run\noff,” she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the\nconfounded girl, who had risen indignantly. “We were quarrelling like\ncats about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of\ndevotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would\nbut have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself\nto be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever,\nand send my image into eternal oblivion!”\n\n“Catherine!” said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to\nstruggle from the tight grasp that held her, “I’d thank you to adhere\nto the truth and not slander me, even in joke! Mr. Heathcliff, be kind\nenough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and\nI are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me\nbeyond expression.”\n\nAs the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly\nindifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned\nand whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.\n\n“By no means!” cried Mrs. Linton in answer. “I won’t be named a dog in\nthe manger again. You _shall_ stay: now then! Heathcliff, why don’t you\nevince satisfaction at my pleasant news? Isabella swears that the love\nEdgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you. I’m sure\nshe made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen? And she has\nfasted ever since the day before yesterday’s walk, from sorrow and rage\nthat I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being\nunacceptable.”\n\n“I think you belie her,” said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face\nthem. “She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!”\n\nAnd he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a\nstrange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance,\nwhich curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it\nraises. The poor thing couldn’t bear that; she grew white and red in\nrapid succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength\nof her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and\nperceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another\nclosed down, and she could not remove the whole together, she began to\nmake use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the\ndetainer’s with crescents of red.\n\n“There’s a tigress!” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and\nshaking her hand with pain. “Begone, for God’s sake, and hide your\nvixen face! How foolish to reveal those talons to _him_. Can’t you\nfancy the conclusions he’ll draw? Look, Heathcliff! they are\ninstruments that will do execution—you must beware of your eyes.”\n\n“I’d wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,” he\nanswered, brutally, when the door had closed after her. “But what did\nyou mean by teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy? You were not\nspeaking the truth, were you?”\n\n“I assure you I was,” she returned. “She has been dying for your sake\nseveral weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a\ndeluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light,\nfor the purpose of mitigating her adoration. But don’t notice it\nfurther: I wished to punish her sauciness, that’s all. I like her too\nwell, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her\nup.”\n\n“And I like her too ill to attempt it,” said he, “except in a very\nghoulish fashion. You’d hear of odd things if I lived alone with that\nmawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white\nthe colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day\nor two: they detestably resemble Linton’s.”\n\n“Delectably!” observed Catherine. “They are dove’s eyes—angel’s!”\n\n“She’s her brother’s heir, is she not?” he asked, after a brief\nsilence.\n\n“I should be sorry to think so,” returned his companion. “Half a dozen\nnephews shall erase her title, please heaven! Abstract your mind from\nthe subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour’s\ngoods; remember _this_ neighbour’s goods are mine.”\n\n“If they were _mine_, they would be none the less that,” said\nHeathcliff; “but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely\nmad; and, in short, we’ll dismiss the matter, as you advise.”\n\nFrom their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from\nher thoughts. The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the\ncourse of the evening. I saw him smile to himself—grin rather—and lapse\ninto ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from\nthe apartment.\n\nI determined to watch his movements. My heart invariably cleaved to the\nmaster’s, in preference to Catherine’s side: with reason I imagined,\nfor he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she—she could not be\ncalled the _opposite_, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide\nlatitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still less\nsympathy for her feelings. I wanted something to happen which might\nhave the effect of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr.\nHeathcliff, quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent. His\nvisits were a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master\nalso. His abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining. I\nfelt that God had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked\nwanderings, and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting\nhis time to spring and destroy.\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nSometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I’ve got up in\na sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the\nfarm. I’ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how\npeople talked regarding his ways; and then I’ve recollected his\nconfirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched\nfrom re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken\nat my word.\n\nOne time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to\nGimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a\nbright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I\ncame to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your\nleft hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north\nside, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a\nguide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The sun shone\nyellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why,\nbut all at once a gush of child’s sensations flowed into my heart.\nHindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed\nlong at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole\nnear the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were\nfond of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as\nreality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on the\nwithered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his little hand\nscooping out the earth with a piece of slate. “Poor Hindley!” I\nexclaimed, involuntarily. I started: my bodily eye was cheated into a\nmomentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight\ninto mine! It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an\nirresistible yearning to be at the Heights. Superstition urged me to\ncomply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead! I thought—or\nshould die soon!—supposing it were a sign of death! The nearer I got to\nthe house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of it I\ntrembled in every limb. The apparition had outstripped me: it stood\nlooking through the gate. That was my first idea on observing an\nelf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the\nbars. Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton, _my_ Hareton,\nnot altered greatly since I left him, ten months since.\n\n“God bless thee, darling!” I cried, forgetting instantaneously my\nfoolish fears. “Hareton, it’s Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.”\n\nHe retreated out of arm’s length, and picked up a large flint.\n\n“I am come to see thy father, Hareton,” I added, guessing from the\naction that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not\nrecognised as one with me.\n\nHe raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but\ncould not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued,\nfrom the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses,\nwhich, whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with\npractised emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking\nexpression of malignity. You may be certain this grieved more than\nangered me. Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it\nto propitiate him. He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as\nif he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him. I showed\nanother, keeping it out of his reach.\n\n“Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?” I inquired. “The\ncurate?”\n\n“Damn the curate, and thee! Gie me that,” he replied.\n\n“Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,” said I.\n“Who’s your master?”\n\n“Devil daddy,” was his answer.\n\n“And what do you learn from daddy?” I continued.\n\nHe jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher. “What does he teach you?” I\nasked.\n\n“Naught,” said he, “but to keep out of his gait. Daddy cannot bide me,\nbecause I swear at him.”\n\n“Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?” I observed.\n\n“Ay—nay,” he drawled.\n\n“Who, then?”\n\n“Heathcliff.”\n\n“I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.”\n\n“Ay!” he answered again.\n\nDesiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the\nsentences—“I known’t: he pays dad back what he gies to me—he curses\ndaddy for cursing me. He says I mun do as I will.”\n\n“And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?” I pursued.\n\n“No, I was told the curate should have his —— teeth dashed down his ——\nthroat, if he stepped over the threshold—Heathcliff had promised that!”\n\nI put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman\ncalled Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate. He\nwent up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,\nHeathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran\ndown the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I\ngained the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a\ngoblin. This is not much connected with Miss Isabella’s affair: except\nthat it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and\ndoing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the\nGrange: even though I should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs.\nLinton’s pleasure.\n\nThe next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some\npigeons in the court. She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law\nfor three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining,\nand we found it a great comfort. Heathcliff had not the habit of\nbestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew. Now, as\nsoon as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping\nsurvey of the house-front. I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I\ndrew out of sight. He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said\nsomething: she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to\nprevent it, he laid his hand on her arm. She averted her face: he\napparently put some question which she had no mind to answer. There was\nanother rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the\nscoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.\n\n“Judas! Traitor!” I ejaculated. “You are a hypocrite, too, are you? A\ndeliberate deceiver.”\n\n“Who is, Nelly?” said Catherine’s voice at my elbow: I had been\nover-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.\n\n“Your worthless friend!” I answered, warmly: “the sneaking rascal\nyonder. Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us—he is coming in! I wonder\nwill he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to\nMiss, when he told you he hated her?”\n\nMrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden;\nand a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door. I couldn’t withhold\ngiving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on\nsilence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to\nbe so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.\n\n“To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!” she cried.\n“You want setting down in your right place! Heathcliff, what are you\nabout, raising this stir? I said you must let Isabella alone!—I beg you\nwill, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to\ndraw the bolts against you!”\n\n“God forbid that he should try!” answered the black villain. I detested\nhim just then. “God keep him meek and patient! Every day I grow madder\nafter sending him to heaven!”\n\n“Hush!” said Catherine, shutting the inner door. “Don’t vex me. Why\nhave you disregarded my request? Did she come across you on purpose?”\n\n“What is it to you?” he growled. “I have a right to kiss her, if she\nchooses; and you have no right to object. I am not _your_ husband:\n_you_ needn’t be jealous of me!”\n\n“I’m not jealous of you,” replied the mistress; “I’m jealous for you.\nClear your face: you sha’n’t scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you\nshall marry her. But do you like her? Tell the truth, Heathcliff!\nThere, you won’t answer. I’m certain you don’t.”\n\n“And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?” I\ninquired.\n\n“Mr. Linton should approve,” returned my lady, decisively.\n\n“He might spare himself the trouble,” said Heathcliff: “I could do as\nwell without his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind\nto speak a few words now, while we are at it. I want you to be aware\nthat I _know_ you have treated me infernally—infernally! Do you hear?\nAnd if you flatter yourself that I don’t perceive it, you are a fool;\nand if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot:\nand if you fancy I’ll suffer unrevenged, I’ll convince you of the\ncontrary, in a very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me\nyour sister-in-law’s secret: I swear I’ll make the most of it. And\nstand you aside!”\n\n“What new phase of his character is this?” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in\namazement. “I’ve treated you infernally—and you’ll take your revenge!\nHow will you take it, ungrateful brute? How have I treated you\ninfernally?”\n\n“I seek no revenge on you,” replied Heathcliff, less vehemently.\n“That’s not the plan. The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don’t\nturn against him; they crush those beneath them. You are welcome to\ntorture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a\nlittle in the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are\nable. Having levelled my palace, don’t erect a hovel and complacently\nadmire your own charity in giving me that for a home. If I imagined you\nreally wished me to marry Isabel, I’d cut my throat!”\n\n“Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?” cried Catherine.\n“Well, I won’t repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering\nSatan a lost soul. Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery. You\nprove it. Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your\ncoming; I begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us\nat peace, appear resolved on exciting a quarrel. Quarrel with Edgar, if\nyou please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you’ll hit on exactly\nthe most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.”\n\nThe conversation ceased. Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and\ngloomy. The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could\nneither lay nor control it. He stood on the hearth with folded arms,\nbrooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek\nthe master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.\n\n“Ellen,” said he, when I entered, “have you seen your mistress?”\n\n“Yes; she’s in the kitchen, sir,” I answered. “She’s sadly put out by\nMr. Heathcliff’s behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it’s time to\narrange his visits on another footing. There’s harm in being too soft,\nand now it’s come to this—.” And I related the scene in the court, and,\nas near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute. I fancied it could\nnot be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so\nafterwards, by assuming the defensive for her guest. Edgar Linton had\ndifficulty in hearing me to the close. His first words revealed that he\ndid not clear his wife of blame.\n\n“This is insufferable!” he exclaimed. “It is disgraceful that she\nshould own him for a friend, and force his company on me! Call me two\nmen out of the hall, Ellen. Catherine shall linger no longer to argue\nwith the low ruffian—I have humoured her enough.”\n\nHe descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,\nfollowed by me, to the kitchen. Its occupants had recommenced their\nangry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed\nvigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat\ncowed by her violent rating apparently. He saw the master first, and\nmade a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed,\nabruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.\n\n“How is this?” said Linton, addressing her; “what notion of propriety\nmust you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to\nyou by that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you\nthink nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps,\nimagine I can get used to it too!”\n\n“Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?” asked the mistress, in a\ntone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both\ncarelessness and contempt of his irritation. Heathcliff, who had raised\nhis eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on\npurpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton’s attention to him. He\nsucceeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high\nflights of passion.\n\n“I’ve been so far forbearing with you, sir,” he said quietly; “not that\nI was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you\nwere only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up\nyour acquaintance, I acquiesced—foolishly. Your presence is a moral\npoison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to\nprevent worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into\nthis house, and give notice now that I require your instant departure.\nThree minutes’ delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.”\n\nHeathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye\nfull of derision.\n\n“Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!” he said. “It is in\ndanger of splitting its skull against my knuckles. By God! Mr. Linton,\nI’m mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!”\n\nMy master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men:\nhe had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter. I obeyed the\nhint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I\nattempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and\nlocked it.\n\n“Fair means!” she said, in answer to her husband’s look of angry\nsurprise. “If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or\nallow yourself to be beaten. It will correct you of feigning more\nvalour than you possess. No, I’ll swallow the key before you shall get\nit! I’m delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each! After constant\nindulgence of one’s weak nature, and the other’s bad one, I earn for\nthanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity! Edgar, I\nwas defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick,\nfor daring to think an evil thought of me!”\n\nIt did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the\nmaster. He tried to wrest the key from Catherine’s grasp, and for\nsafety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr.\nEdgar was taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew\ndeadly pale. For his life he could not avert that excess of emotion:\nmingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely. He leant on\nthe back of a chair, and covered his face.\n\n“Oh, heavens! In old days this would win you knighthood!” exclaimed\nMrs. Linton. “We are vanquished! we are vanquished! Heathcliff would as\nsoon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a\ncolony of mice. Cheer up! you sha’n’t be hurt! Your type is not a lamb,\nit’s a sucking leveret.”\n\n“I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!” said her friend. “I\ncompliment you on your taste. And that is the slavering, shivering\nthing you preferred to me! I would not strike him with my fist, but I’d\nkick him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he\nweeping, or is he going to faint for fear?”\n\nThe fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.\nHe’d better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and\nstruck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a\nslighter man. It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr.\nLinton walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to\nthe front entrance.\n\n“There! you’ve done with coming here,” cried Catherine. “Get away, now;\nhe’ll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants. If he\ndid overhear us, of course he’d never forgive you. You’ve played me an\nill turn, Heathcliff! But go—make haste! I’d rather see Edgar at bay\nthan you.”\n\n“Do you suppose I’m going with that blow burning in my gullet?” he\nthundered. “By hell, no! I’ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut\nbefore I cross the threshold! If I don’t floor him now, I shall murder\nhim some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!”\n\n“He is not coming,” I interposed, framing a bit of a lie. “There’s the\ncoachman and the two gardeners; you’ll surely not wait to be thrust\ninto the road by them! Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very\nlikely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil\nhis orders.”\n\nThe gardeners and coachman _were_ there: but Linton was with them. They\nhad already entered the court. Heathcliff, on the second thoughts,\nresolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the\npoker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as\nthey tramped in.\n\nMrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her upstairs.\nShe did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was\nanxious to keep her in ignorance.\n\n“I’m nearly distracted, Nelly!” she exclaimed, throwing herself on the\nsofa. “A thousand smiths’ hammers are beating in my head! Tell Isabella\nto shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else\naggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild. And, Nelly, say to\nEdgar, if you see him again to-night, that I’m in danger of being\nseriously ill. I wish it may prove true. He has startled and distressed\nme shockingly! I want to frighten him. Besides, he might come and begin\na string of abuse or complainings; I’m certain I should recriminate,\nand God knows where we should end! Will you do so, my good Nelly? You\nare aware that I am no way blamable in this matter. What possessed him\nto turn listener? Heathcliff’s talk was outrageous, after you left us;\nbut I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant\nnothing. Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool’s craving to hear evil of\nself, that haunts some people like a demon! Had Edgar never gathered\nour conversation, he would never have been the worse for it. Really,\nwhen he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I\nhad scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for _him;_ I did not care\nhardly what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however\nthe scene closed, we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how\nlong! Well, if I cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend—if Edgar will be\nmean and jealous, I’ll try to break their hearts by breaking my own.\nThat will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am pushed to\nextremity! But it’s a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope; I’d not\ntake Linton by surprise with it. To this point he has been discreet in\ndreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that\npolicy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled,\non frenzy. I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that\ncountenance, and look rather more anxious about me.”\n\nThe stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt,\nrather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but\nI believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion\nto account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control\nherself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish\nto “frighten” her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for\nthe purpose of serving her selfishness. Therefore I said nothing when I\nmet the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of\nturning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel\ntogether. He began to speak first.\n\n“Remain where you are, Catherine,” he said; without any anger in his\nvoice, but with much sorrowful despondency. “I shall not stay. I am\nneither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn\nwhether, after this evening’s events, you intend to continue your\nintimacy with—”\n\n“Oh, for mercy’s sake,” interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot,\n“for mercy’s sake, let us hear no more of it now! Your cold blood\ncannot be worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but\nmine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.”\n\n“To get rid of me, answer my question,” persevered Mr. Linton. “You\n_must_ answer it; and that violence does not alarm me. I have found\nthat you can be as stoical as anyone, when you please. Will you give up\nHeathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me? It is impossible for you\nto be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and I absolutely\n_require_ to know which you choose.”\n\n“I require to be let alone!” exclaimed Catherine, furiously. “I demand\nit! Don’t you see I can scarcely stand? Edgar, you—you leave me!”\n\nShe rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely. It\nwas enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages!\nThere she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and\ngrinding her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to\nsplinters! Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and\nfear. He told me to fetch some water. She had no breath for speaking. I\nbrought a glass full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her\nface. In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up\nher eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the\naspect of death. Linton looked terrified.\n\n“There is nothing in the world the matter,” I whispered. I did not want\nhim to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.\n\n“She has blood on her lips!” he said, shuddering.\n\n“Never mind!” I answered, tartly. And I told him how she had resolved,\nprevious to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously\ngave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up—her hair\nflying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck\nand arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken\nbones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then\nrushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her\nchamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against\nme.\n\nAs she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to\nask whether she would have some carried up. “No!” she replied,\nperemptorily. The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and\nagain on the morrow after, and received the same answer. Mr. Linton, on\nhis part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire concerning\nhis wife’s occupations. Isabella and he had had an hour’s interview,\nduring which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper\nhorror for Heathcliff’s advances: but he could make nothing of her\nevasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination\nunsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she were\nso insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all\nbonds of relationship between herself and him.\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nWhile Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and\nalmost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books\nthat he never opened—wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague\nexpectation that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her\nown accord to ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation—and _she_ fasted\npertinaciously, under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was\nready to choke for her absence, and pride alone held him from running\nto cast himself at her feet; I went about my household duties,\nconvinced that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and\nthat lodged in my body. I wasted no condolences on Miss, nor any\nexpostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to the\nsighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady’s name, since he might\nnot hear her voice. I determined they should come about as they pleased\nfor me; and though it was a tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice\nat length in a faint dawn of its progress: as I thought at first.\n\nMrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished\nthe water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a\nbasin of gruel, for she believed she was dying. That I set down as a\nspeech meant for Edgar’s ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it\nto myself and brought her some tea and dry toast. She ate and drank\neagerly, and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and\ngroaning. “Oh, I will die,” she exclaimed, “since no one cares anything\nabout me. I wish I had not taken that.” Then a good while after I heard\nher murmur, “No, I’ll not die—he’d be glad—he does not love me at\nall—he would never miss me!”\n\n“Did you want anything, ma’am?” I inquired, still preserving my\nexternal composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange,\nexaggerated manner.\n\n“What is that apathetic being doing?” she demanded, pushing the thick\nentangled locks from her wasted face. “Has he fallen into a lethargy,\nor is he dead?”\n\n“Neither,” replied I; “if you mean Mr. Linton. He’s tolerably well, I\nthink, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is\ncontinually among his books, since he has no other society.”\n\nI should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I\ncould not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.\n\n“Among his books!” she cried, confounded. “And I dying! I on the brink\nof the grave! My God! does he know how I’m altered?” continued she,\nstaring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite\nwall. “Is that Catherine Linton? He imagines me in a pet—in play,\nperhaps. Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest? Nelly, if\nit be not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I’ll choose\nbetween these two: either to starve at once—that would be no punishment\nunless he had a heart—or to recover, and leave the country. Are you\nspeaking the truth about him now? Take care. Is he actually so utterly\nindifferent for my life?”\n\n“Why, ma’am,” I answered, “the master has no idea of your being\nderanged; and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die\nof hunger.”\n\n“You think not? Cannot you tell him I will?” she returned. “Persuade\nhim! speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!”\n\n“No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,” I suggested, “that you have eaten some\nfood with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its\ngood effects.”\n\n“If I were only sure it would kill him,” she interrupted, “I’d kill\nmyself directly! These three awful nights I’ve never closed my lids—and\noh, I’ve been tormented! I’ve been haunted, Nelly! But I begin to fancy\nyou don’t like me. How strange! I thought, though everybody hated and\ndespised each other, they could not avoid loving me. And they have all\nturned to enemies in a few hours. _They_ have, I’m positive; the people\n_here_. How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!\nIsabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be\nso dreadful to watch Catherine go. And Edgar standing solemnly by to\nsee it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace\nto his house, and going back to his _books_! What in the name of all\nthat feels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?”\n\nShe could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr.\nLinton’s philosophical resignation. Tossing about, she increased her\nfeverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth;\nthen raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the\nwindow. We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the\nnorth-east, and I objected. Both the expressions flitting over her\nface, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and\nbrought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor’s\ninjunction that she should not be crossed. A minute previously she was\nviolent; now, supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey\nher, she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from\nthe rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to\ntheir different species: her mind had strayed to other associations.\n\n“That’s a turkey’s,” she murmured to herself; “and this is a wild\nduck’s; and this is a pigeon’s. Ah, they put pigeons’ feathers in the\npillows—no wonder I couldn’t die! Let me take care to throw it on the\nfloor when I lie down. And here is a moor-cock’s; and this—I should\nknow it among a thousand—it’s a lapwing’s. Bonny bird; wheeling over\nour heads in the middle of the moor. It wanted to get to its nest, for\nthe clouds had touched the swells, and it felt rain coming. This\nfeather was picked up from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its\nnest in the winter, full of little skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap\nover it, and the old ones dared not come. I made him promise he’d never\nshoot a lapwing after that, and he didn’t. Yes, here are more! Did he\nshoot my lapwings, Nelly? Are they red, any of them? Let me look.”\n\n“Give over with that baby-work!” I interrupted, dragging the pillow\naway, and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing\nits contents by handfuls. “Lie down and shut your eyes: you’re\nwandering. There’s a mess! The down is flying about like snow.”\n\nI went here and there collecting it.\n\n“I see in you, Nelly,” she continued dreamily, “an aged woman: you have\ngrey hair and bent shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave under\nPenistone Crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers;\npretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of wool. That’s\nwhat you’ll come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now. I’m\nnot wandering: you’re mistaken, or else I should believe you really\n_were_ that withered hag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone\nCrags; and I’m conscious it’s night, and there are two candles on the\ntable making the black press shine like jet.”\n\n“The black press? where is that?” I asked. “You are talking in your\nsleep!”\n\n“It’s against the wall, as it always is,” she replied. “It _does_\nappear odd—I see a face in it!”\n\n“There’s no press in the room, and never was,” said I, resuming my\nseat, and looping up the curtain that I might watch her.\n\n“Don’t _you_ see that face?” she inquired, gazing earnestly at the\nmirror.\n\nAnd say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be\nher own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.\n\n“It’s behind there still!” she pursued, anxiously. “And it stirred. Who\nis it? I hope it will not come out when you are gone! Oh! Nelly, the\nroom is haunted! I’m afraid of being alone!”\n\nI took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of\nshudders convulsed her frame, and she _would_ keep straining her gaze\ntowards the glass.\n\n“There’s nobody here!” I insisted. “It was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you\nknew it a while since.”\n\n“Myself!” she gasped, “and the clock is striking twelve! It’s true,\nthen! that’s dreadful!”\n\nHer fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes. I\nattempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her\nhusband; but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek—the shawl had\ndropped from the frame.\n\n“Why, what _is_ the matter?” cried I. “Who is coward now? Wake up! That\nis the glass—the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and\nthere am I too by your side.”\n\nTrembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually\npassed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of\nshame.\n\n“Oh, dear! I thought I was at home,” she sighed. “I thought I was lying\nin my chamber at Wuthering Heights. Because I’m weak, my brain got\nconfused, and I screamed unconsciously. Don’t say anything; but stay\nwith me. I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.”\n\n“A sound sleep would do you good, ma’am,” I answered: “and I hope this\nsuffering will prevent your trying starving again.”\n\n“Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!” she went on\nbitterly, wringing her hands. “And that wind sounding in the firs by\nthe lattice. Do let me feel it—it comes straight down the moor—do let\nme have one breath!”\n\nTo pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds. A cold blast\nrushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post. She lay still\nnow, her face bathed in tears. Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued\nher spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child.\n\n“How long is it since I shut myself in here?” she asked, suddenly\nreviving.\n\n“It was Monday evening,” I replied, “and this is Thursday night, or\nrather Friday morning, at present.”\n\n“What! of the same week?” she exclaimed. “Only that brief time?”\n\n“Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,”\nobserved I.\n\n“Well, it seems a weary number of hours,” she muttered doubtfully: “it\nmust be more. I remember being in the parlour after they had\nquarrelled, and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this\nroom desperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness\noverwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn’t explain to Edgar\nhow certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he\npersisted in teasing me! I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he\ndid not guess my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to\nescape from him and his voice. Before I recovered sufficiently to see\nand hear, it began to be dawn, and, Nelly, I’ll tell you what I\nthought, and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my\nreason. I thought as I lay there, with my head against that table leg,\nand my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window, that I was\nenclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with some\ngreat grief which, just waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and\nworried myself to discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the\nwhole last seven years of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that\nthey had been at all. I was a child; my father was just buried, and my\nmisery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered between me\nand Heathcliff. I was laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from\na dismal doze after a night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the\npanels aside: it struck the table-top! I swept it along the carpet, and\nthen memory burst in: my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of\ndespair. I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched: it must have been\ntemporary derangement; for there is scarcely cause. But, supposing at\ntwelve years old I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every early\nassociation, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and\nbeen converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross\nGrange, and the wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth,\nfrom what had been my world. You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where\nI grovelled! Shake your head as you will, Nelly, _you_ have helped to\nunsettle me! You should have spoken to Edgar, indeed you should, and\ncompelled him to leave me quiet! Oh, I’m burning! I wish I were out of\ndoors! I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free; and\nlaughing at injuries, not maddening under them! Why am I so changed?\nwhy does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words? I’m sure I\nshould be myself were I once among the heather on those hills. Open the\nwindow again wide: fasten it open! Quick, why don’t you move?”\n\n“Because I won’t give you your death of cold,” I answered.\n\n“You won’t give me a chance of life, you mean,” she said sullenly.\n“However, I’m not helpless yet; I’ll open it myself.”\n\nAnd sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the\nroom, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless\nof the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife. I\nentreated, and finally attempted to force her to retire. But I soon\nfound her delirious strength much surpassed mine (she _was_ delirious,\nI became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings). There was no\nmoon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed\nfrom any house, far or near; all had been extinguished long ago: and\nthose at Wuthering Heights were never visible—still she asserted she\ncaught their shining.\n\n“Look!” she cried eagerly, “that’s my room with the candle in it, and\nthe trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph’s\ngarret. Joseph sits up late, doesn’t he? He’s waiting till I come home\nthat he may lock the gate. Well, he’ll wait a while yet. It’s a rough\njourney, and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton\nKirk to go that journey! We’ve braved its ghosts often together, and\ndared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come. But,\nHeathcliff, if I dare you now, will you venture? If you do, I’ll keep\nyou. I’ll not lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep,\nand throw the church down over me, but I won’t rest till you are with\nme. I never will!”\n\nShe paused, and resumed with a strange smile. “He’s considering—he’d\nrather I’d come to him! Find a way, then! not through that kirkyard.\nYou are slow! Be content, you always followed me!”\n\nPerceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I\ncould reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of\nherself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when,\nto my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr.\nLinton entered. He had only then come from the library; and, in passing\nthrough the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by\ncuriosity, or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.\n\n“Oh, sir!” I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the\nsight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber. “My poor\nmistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all;\npray, come and persuade her to go to bed. Forget your anger, for she’s\nhard to guide any way but her own.”\n\n“Catherine ill?” he said, hastening to us. “Shut the window, Ellen!\nCatherine! why—”\n\nHe was silent. The haggardness of Mrs. Linton’s appearance smote him\nspeechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified\nastonishment.\n\n“She’s been fretting here,” I continued, “and eating scarcely anything,\nand never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening,\nand so we couldn’t inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it\nourselves; but it is nothing.”\n\nI felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned. “It is\nnothing, is it, Ellen Dean?” he said sternly. “You shall account more\nclearly for keeping me ignorant of this!” And he took his wife in his\narms, and looked at her with anguish.\n\nAt first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her\nabstracted gaze. The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her\neyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her\nattention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.\n\n“Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?” she said, with angry\nanimation. “You are one of those things that are ever found when least\nwanted, and when you are wanted, never! I suppose we shall have plenty\nof lamentations now—I see we shall—but they can’t keep me from my\nnarrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I’m bound before spring\nis over! There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the\nchapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please\nyourself whether you go to them or come to me!”\n\n“Catherine, what have you done?” commenced the master. “Am I nothing to\nyou any more? Do you love that wretch Heath—”\n\n“Hush!” cried Mrs. Linton. “Hush, this moment! You mention that name\nand I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window! What you\ntouch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top\nbefore you lay hands on me again. I don’t want you, Edgar: I’m past\nwanting you. Return to your books. I’m glad you possess a consolation,\nfor all you had in me is gone.”\n\n“Her mind wanders, sir,” I interposed. “She has been talking nonsense\nthe whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and\nshe’ll rally. Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.”\n\n“I desire no further advice from you,” answered Mr. Linton. “You knew\nyour mistress’s nature, and you encouraged me to harass her. And not to\ngive me one hint of how she has been these three days! It was\nheartless! Months of sickness could not cause such a change!”\n\nI began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for\nanother’s wicked waywardness. “I knew Mrs. Linton’s nature to be\nheadstrong and domineering,” cried I: “but I didn’t know that you\nwished to foster her fierce temper! I didn’t know that, to humour her,\nI should wink at Mr. Heathcliff. I performed the duty of a faithful\nservant in telling you, and I have got a faithful servant’s wages!\nWell, it will teach me to be careful next time. Next time you may\ngather intelligence for yourself!”\n\n“The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen\nDean,” he replied.\n\n“You’d rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?” said\nI. “Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to\ndrop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison\nthe mistress against you?”\n\nConfused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our\nconversation.\n\n“Ah! Nelly has played traitor,” she exclaimed, passionately. “Nelly is\nmy hidden enemy. You witch! So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us! Let me\ngo, and I’ll make her rue! I’ll make her howl a recantation!”\n\nA maniac’s fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to\ndisengage herself from Linton’s arms. I felt no inclination to tarry\nthe event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility,\nI quitted the chamber.\n\nIn passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook\nis driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly,\nevidently by another agent than the wind. Notwithstanding my hurry, I\nstayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction\nimpressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.\nMy surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more\nthan vision, Miss Isabella’s springer, Fanny, suspended by a\nhandkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp. I quickly released the\nanimal, and lifted it into the garden. I had seen it follow its\nmistress upstairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could\nhave got out there, and what mischievous person had treated it so.\nWhile untying the knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I\nrepeatedly caught the beat of horses’ feet galloping at some distance;\nbut there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I\nhardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange sound,\nin that place, at two o’clock in the morning.\n\nMr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a\npatient in the village as I came up the street; and my account of\nCatherine Linton’s malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.\nHe was a plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of\nher surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to\nhis directions than she had shown herself before.\n\n“Nelly Dean,” said he, “I can’t help fancying there’s an extra cause\nfor this. What has there been to do at the Grange? We’ve odd reports up\nhere. A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a\ntrifle; and that sort of people should not either. It’s hard work\nbringing them through fevers, and such things. How did it begin?”\n\n“The master will inform you,” I answered; “but you are acquainted with\nthe Earnshaws’ violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all. I\nmay say this; it commenced in a quarrel. She was struck during a\ntempest of passion with a kind of fit. That’s her account, at least:\nfor she flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.\nAfterwards, she refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and\nremains in a half dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind\nfilled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions.”\n\n“Mr. Linton will be sorry?” observed Kenneth, interrogatively.\n\n“Sorry? he’ll break his heart should anything happen!” I replied.\n“Don’t alarm him more than necessary.”\n\n“Well, I told him to beware,” said my companion; “and he must bide the\nconsequences of neglecting my warning! Hasn’t he been intimate with Mr.\nHeathcliff lately?”\n\n“Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,” answered I, “though more\non the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than\nbecause the master likes his company. At present he’s discharged from\nthe trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after\nMiss Linton which he manifested. I hardly think he’ll be taken in\nagain.”\n\n“And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?” was the doctor’s\nnext question.\n\n“I’m not in her confidence,” returned I, reluctant to continue the\nsubject.\n\n“No, she’s a sly one,” he remarked, shaking his head. “She keeps her\nown counsel! But she’s a real little fool. I have it from good\nauthority that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and\nHeathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house\nabove two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount\nhis horse and away with him! My informant said she could only put him\noff by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first\nmeeting after that: when it was to be he didn’t hear; but you urge Mr.\nLinton to look sharp!”\n\nThis news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran\nmost of the way back. The little dog was yelping in the garden yet. I\nspared a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the\nhouse door, it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have\nescaped to the road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me. On\nascending to Isabella’s room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was\nempty. Had I been a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton’s illness might have\narrested her rash step. But what could be done now? There was a bare\npossibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly. _I_ could not\npursue them, however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the\nplace with confusion; still less unfold the business to my master,\nabsorbed as he was in his present calamity, and having no heart to\nspare for a second grief! I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue,\nand suffer matters to take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I\nwent with a badly composed countenance to announce him. Catherine lay\nin a troubled sleep: her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess\nof frenzy; he now hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every\nchange of her painfully expressive features.\n\nThe doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him\nof its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve\naround her perfect and constant tranquillity. To me, he signified the\nthreatening danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of\nintellect.\n\nI did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we\nnever went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual\nhour, moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging\nwhispers as they encountered each other in their vocations. Every one\nwas active but Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she\nslept: her brother, too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient\nfor her presence, and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her\nsister-in-law. I trembled lest he should send me to call her; but I was\nspared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight. One of\nthe maids, a thoughtless girl, who had been on an early errand to\nGimmerton, came panting upstairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the\nchamber, crying: “Oh, dear, dear! What mun we have next? Master,\nmaster, our young lady—”\n\n“Hold your noise!” cried I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.\n\n“Speak lower, Mary—What is the matter?” said Mr. Linton. “What ails\nyour young lady?”\n\n“She’s gone, she’s gone! Yon’ Heathcliff’s run off wi’ her!” gasped the\ngirl.\n\n“That is not true!” exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation. “It cannot\nbe: how has the idea entered your head? Ellen Dean, go and seek her. It\nis incredible: it cannot be.”\n\nAs he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his\ndemand to know her reasons for such an assertion.\n\n“Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,” she stammered,\n“and he asked whether we weren’t in trouble at the Grange. I thought he\nmeant for missis’s sickness, so I answered, yes. Then says he, ‘There’s\nsomebody gone after ’em, I guess?’ I stared. He saw I knew nought about\nit, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse’s\nshoe fastened at a blacksmith’s shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not\nvery long after midnight! and how the blacksmith’s lass had got up to\nspy who they were: she knew them both directly. And she noticed the\nman—Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob’dy could mistake him,\nbesides—put a sovereign in her father’s hand for payment. The lady had\na cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she\ndrank it fell back, and she saw her very plain. Heathcliff held both\nbridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and\nwent as fast as the rough roads would let them. The lass said nothing\nto her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.”\n\nI ran and peeped, for form’s sake, into Isabella’s room; confirming,\nwhen I returned, the servant’s statement. Mr. Linton had resumed his\nseat by the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the\nmeaning of my blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order,\nor uttering a word.\n\n“Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,” I\ninquired. “How should we do?”\n\n“She went of her own accord,” answered the master; “she had a right to\ngo if she pleased. Trouble me no more about her. Hereafter she is only\nmy sister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has\ndisowned me.”\n\nAnd that was all he said on the subject: he did not make a single inquiry\nfurther, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what\nproperty she had in the house to her fresh home, wherever it was, when\nI knew it.\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nFor two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs.\nLinton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was\ndenominated a brain fever. No mother could have nursed an only child\nmore devotedly than Edgar tended her. Day and night he was watching,\nand patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a\nshaken reason could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he\nsaved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the\nsource of constant future anxiety—in fact, that his health and strength\nwere being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity—he knew no\nlimits in gratitude and joy when Catherine’s life was declared out of\ndanger; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the\ngradual return to bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes\nwith the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance\nalso, and she would soon be entirely her former self.\n\nThe first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the\nfollowing March. Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a\nhandful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of\npleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered\nthem eagerly together.\n\n“These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,” she exclaimed. “They\nremind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted\nsnow. Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost\ngone?”\n\n“The snow is quite gone down here, darling,” replied her husband; “and\nI only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is\nblue, and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim\nfull. Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you\nunder this roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the\nair blows so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.”\n\n“I shall never be there but once more,” said the invalid; “and then\nyou’ll leave me, and I shall remain for ever. Next spring you’ll long\nagain to have me under this roof, and you’ll look back and think you\nwere happy to-day.”\n\nLinton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by\nthe fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the\ntears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding. We\nknew she was really better, and, therefore, decided that long\nconfinement to a single place produced much of this despondency, and it\nmight be partially removed by a change of scene. The master told me to\nlight a fire in the many-weeks’ deserted parlour, and to set an\neasy-chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her down,\nand she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected,\nrevived by the objects round her: which, though familiar, were free\nfrom the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber. By\nevening she seemed greatly exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade\nher to return to that apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa\nfor her bed, till another room could be prepared. To obviate the\nfatigue of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where\nyou lie at present—on the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon\nstrong enough to move from one to the other, leaning on Edgar’s arm.\nAh, I thought myself, she might recover, so waited on as she was. And\nthere was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that\nof another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton’s\nheart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger’s\ngripe, by the birth of an heir.\n\nI should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from\nher departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff.\nIt appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil\nan obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and\nreconciliation, if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she\ncould not help it then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal\nit. Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more,\nI got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a\nbride just out of the honeymoon. I’ll read it: for I keep it yet. Any\nrelic of the dead is precious, if they were valued living.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDEAR ELLEN, it begins,—I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and\nheard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very\nill. I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too\nangry or too distressed to answer what I sent him. Still, I must write\nto somebody, and the only choice left me is you.\n\nInform Edgar that I’d give the world to see his face again—that my\nheart returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left\nit, and is there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and\nCatherine! _I can’t follow it though_—(these words are underlined)—they\nneed not expect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please;\ntaking care, however, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or\ndeficient affection.\n\nThe remainder of the letter is for yourself alone. I want to ask you\ntwo questions: the first is,—How did you contrive to preserve the\ncommon sympathies of human nature when you resided here? I cannot\nrecognise any sentiment which those around share with me.\n\nThe second question I have great interest in; it is this—Is Mr.\nHeathcliff a man? If so, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil? I\nsha’n’t tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to\nexplain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see\nme; and you must call, Ellen, very soon. Don’t write, but come, and\nbring me something from Edgar.\n\nNow, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am\nled to imagine the Heights will be. It is to amuse myself that I dwell\non such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my\nthoughts, except at the moment when I miss them. I should laugh and\ndance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries,\nand the rest was an unnatural dream!\n\nThe sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I\njudged it to be six o’clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to\ninspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as\nwell as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard\nof the farmhouse, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to\nreceive us by the light of a dip candle. He did it with a courtesy that\nredounded to his credit. His first act was to elevate his torch to a\nlevel with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn\naway. Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables;\nreappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived\nin an ancient castle.\n\nHeathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen—a dingy,\nuntidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it\nwas in your charge. By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb\nand dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his\nmouth.\n\n“This is Edgar’s legal nephew,” I reflected—“mine in a manner; I must\nshake hands, and—yes—I must kiss him. It is right to establish a good\nunderstanding at the beginning.”\n\nI approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said—“How do you\ndo, my dear?”\n\nHe replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.\n\n“Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?” was my next essay at\nconversation.\n\nAn oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not “frame off”\nrewarded my perseverance.\n\n“Hey, Throttler, lad!” whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred\nbull-dog from its lair in a corner. “Now, wilt thou be ganging?” he\nasked authoritatively.\n\nLove for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to\nwait till the others should enter. Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible;\nand Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany\nme in, after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and\nreplied—“Mim! mim! mim! Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?\nMincing un’ munching! How can I tell whet ye say?”\n\n“I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!” I cried, thinking\nhim deaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.\n\n“None o’ me! I getten summut else to do,” he answered, and continued\nhis work; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and\ncountenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I’m\nsure, as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.\n\nI walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at\nwhich I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant\nmight show himself. After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall,\ngaunt man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his\nfeatures were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders;\nand _his_ eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine’s with all their\nbeauty annihilated.\n\n“What’s your business here?” he demanded, grimly. “Who are you?”\n\n“My name _was_ Isabella Linton,” I replied. “You’ve seen me before,\nsir. I’m lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here—I\nsuppose by your permission.”\n\n“Is he come back, then?” asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.\n\n“Yes—we came just now,” I said; “but he left me by the kitchen door;\nand when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the\nplace, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.”\n\n“It’s well the hellish villain has kept his word!” growled my future\nhost, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering\nHeathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and\nthreats of what he would have done had the “fiend” deceived him.\n\nI repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined\nto slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that\nintention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door. There\nwas a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment,\nwhose floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant\npewter-dishes, which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook\nof a similar obscurity, created by tarnish and dust. I inquired whether\nI might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom! Mr. Earnshaw\nvouchsafed no answer. He walked up and down, with his hands in his\npockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction\nwas evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I\nshrank from disturbing him again.\n\nYou’ll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,\nseated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and\nremembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing\nthe only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the\nAtlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass\nthem! I questioned with myself—where must I turn for comfort? and—mind\nyou don’t tell Edgar, or Catherine—above every sorrow beside, this rose\npre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally\nagainst Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost\ngladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone\nwith him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not\nfear their intermeddling.\n\nI sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and\nstill my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and\nperfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself\nout at intervals. I listened to detect a woman’s voice in the house,\nand filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations,\nwhich, at last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping. I\nwas not aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in\nhis measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise.\nTaking advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed—“I’m tired\nwith my journey, and I want to go to bed! Where is the maid-servant?\nDirect me to her, as she won’t come to me!”\n\n“We have none,” he answered; “you must wait on yourself!”\n\n“Where must I sleep, then?” I sobbed; I was beyond regarding\nself-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.\n\n“Joseph will show you Heathcliff’s chamber,” said he; “open that\ndoor—he’s in there.”\n\nI was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the\nstrangest tone—“Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your\nbolt—don’t omit it!”\n\n“Well!” I said. “But why, Mr. Earnshaw?” I did not relish the notion of\ndeliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.\n\n“Look here!” he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a\ncuriously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife\nattached to the barrel. “That’s a great tempter to a desperate man, is\nit not? I cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his\ndoor. If once I find it open he’s done for; I do it invariably, even\nthough the minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that\nshould make me refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own\nschemes by killing him. You fight against that devil for love as long\nas you may; when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall\nsave him!”\n\nI surveyed the weapon inquisitively. A hideous notion struck me: how\npowerful I should be possessing such an instrument! I took it from his\nhand, and touched the blade. He looked astonished at the expression my\nface assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was\ncovetousness. He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,\nand returned it to its concealment.\n\n“I don’t care if you tell him,” said he. “Put him on his guard, and\nwatch for him. You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not\nshock you.”\n\n“What has Heathcliff done to you?” I asked. “In what has he wronged\nyou, to warrant this appalling hatred? Wouldn’t it be wiser to bid him\nquit the house?”\n\n“No!” thundered Earnshaw; “should he offer to leave me, he’s a dead\nman: persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess! Am I to lose\n_all_, without a chance of retrieval? Is Hareton to be a beggar? Oh,\ndamnation! I _will_ have it back; and I’ll have _his_ gold too; and\nthen his blood; and hell shall have his soul! It will be ten times\nblacker with that guest than ever it was before!”\n\nYou’ve acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master’s habits. He is\nclearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least. I\nshuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant’s ill-bred\nmoroseness as comparatively agreeable. He now recommenced his moody\nwalk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen. Joseph was\nbending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it;\nand a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by. The contents\nof the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the\nbowl; I conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper,\nand, being hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out\nsharply, “_I’ll_ make the porridge!” I removed the vessel out of his\nreach, and proceeded to take off my hat and riding-habit. “Mr.\nEarnshaw,” I continued, “directs me to wait on myself: I will. I’m not\ngoing to act the lady among you, for fear I should starve.”\n\n“Gooid Lord!” he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed\nstockings from the knee to the ankle. “If there’s to be fresh\northerings—just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev’ a\n_mistress_ set o’er my heead, it’s like time to be flitting. I niver\n_did_ think to see t’ day that I mud lave th’ owld place—but I doubt\nit’s nigh at hand!”\n\nThis lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work,\nsighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but\ncompelled speedily to drive off the remembrance. It racked me to recall\npast happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its\napparition, the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the\nhandfuls of meal fell into the water. Joseph beheld my style of cookery\nwith growing indignation.\n\n“Thear!” he ejaculated. “Hareton, thou willn’t sup thy porridge\nto-neeght; they’ll be naught but lumps as big as my neive. Thear,\nagean! I’d fling in bowl un’ all, if I wer ye! There, pale t’ guilp\noff, un’ then ye’ll hae done wi’t. Bang, bang. It’s a mercy t’ bothom\nisn’t deaved out!”\n\nIt _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four\nhad been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from\nthe dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling\nfrom the expansive lip. I expostulated, and desired that he should have\nhis in a mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so\ndirtily. The old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety;\nassuring me, repeatedly, that “the barn was every bit as good” as I,\n“and every bit as wollsome,” and wondering how I could fashion to be so\nconceited. Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and\nglowered up at me defyingly, as he slavered into the jug.\n\n“I shall have my supper in another room,” I said. “Have you no place\nyou call a parlour?”\n\n“_Parlour_!” he echoed, sneeringly, “_parlour_! Nay, we’ve noa\n_parlours_. If yah dunnut loike wer company, there’s maister’s; un’ if\nyah dunnut loike maister, there’s us.”\n\n“Then I shall go upstairs,” I answered; “show me a chamber.”\n\nI put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk. With\ngreat grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we\nmounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into\nthe apartments we passed.\n\n“Here’s a rahm,” he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on\nhinges. “It’s weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in. There’s a pack o’\ncorn i’ t’ corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye’re feared o’ muckying\nyer grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o’ t’ top on’t.”\n\nThe “rahm” was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain;\nvarious sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare\nspace in the middle.\n\n“Why, man,” I exclaimed, facing him angrily, “this is not a place to\nsleep in. I wish to see my bed-room.”\n\n“_Bed-rume_!” he repeated, in a tone of mockery. “Yah’s see all t’\n_bed-rumes_ thear is—yon’s mine.”\n\nHe pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in\nbeing more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless\nbed, with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.\n\n“What do I want with yours?” I retorted. “I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does\nnot lodge at the top of the house, does he?”\n\n“Oh! it’s Maister _Hathecliff’s_ ye’re wanting?” cried he, as if making\na new discovery. “Couldn’t ye ha’ said soa, at onst? un’ then, I mud\nha’ telled ye, baht all this wark, that that’s just one ye cannut\nsee—he allas keeps it locked, un’ nob’dy iver mells on’t but hisseln.”\n\n“You’ve a nice house, Joseph,” I could not refrain from observing, “and\npleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the\nmadness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my\nfate with theirs! However, that is not to the present purpose—there are\nother rooms. For heaven’s sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!”\n\nHe made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the\nwooden steps, and halting before an apartment which, from that halt\nand the superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best\none. There was a carpet—a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by\ndust; a fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome\noak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material\nand modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the\nvallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod\nsupporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to\ntrail upon the floor. The chairs were also damaged, many of them\nseverely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls. I was\nendeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,\nwhen my fool of a guide announced,—“This here is t’ maister’s.” My\nsupper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience\nexhausted. I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of\nrefuge, and means of repose.\n\n“Whear the divil?” began the religious elder. “The Lord bless us! The\nLord forgie us! Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang? ye marred, wearisome\nnowt! Ye’ve seen all but Hareton’s bit of a cham’er. There’s not\nanother hoile to lig down in i’ th’ hahse!”\n\nI was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and\nthen seated myself at the stairs’-head, hid my face in my hands, and\ncried.\n\n“Ech! ech!” exclaimed Joseph. “Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss\nCathy! Howsiver, t’ maister sall just tum’le o’er them brocken pots;\nun’ then we’s hear summut; we’s hear how it’s to be. Gooid-for-naught\nmadling! ye desarve pining fro’ this to Churstmas, flinging t’ precious\ngifts uh God under fooit i’ yer flaysome rages! But I’m mista’en if ye\nshew yer sperrit lang. Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye?\nI nobbut wish he may catch ye i’ that plisky. I nobbut wish he may.”\n\nAnd so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with\nhim; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding\nthis silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my\npride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its\neffects. An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of\nThrottler, whom I now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had\nspent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr.\nHindley. I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of\nsalute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from\nstep to step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the\nspatters of milk from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our\nlabours were scarcely over when I heard Earnshaw’s tread in the\npassage; my assistant tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I\nstole into the nearest doorway. The dog’s endeavour to avoid him was\nunsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter downstairs, and a prolonged,\npiteous yelping. I had better luck: he passed on, entered his chamber,\nand shut the door. Directly after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put\nhim to bed. I had found shelter in Hareton’s room, and the old man, on\nseeing me, said,—“They’s rahm for boath ye un’ yer pride, now, I sud\nthink i’ the hahse. It’s empty; ye may hev’ it all to yerseln, un’ Him\nas allas maks a third, i’ sich ill company!”\n\nGladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung\nmyself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept. My slumber was\ndeep and sweet, though over far too soon. Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he\nhad just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing\nthere? I told him the cause of my staying up so late—that he had the\nkey of our room in his pocket. The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.\nHe swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he’d—but I’ll not\nrepeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious\nand unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence! I sometimes wonder at\nhim with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger\nor a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which\nhe wakens. He told me of Catherine’s illness, and accused my brother of\ncausing it; promising that I should be Edgar’s proxy in suffering, till\nhe could get hold of him.\n\nI do hate him—I am wretched—I have been a fool! Beware of uttering one\nbreath of this to any one at the Grange. I shall expect you every\nday—don’t disappoint me!—ISABELLA.\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nAs soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and\ninformed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a\nletter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton’s situation, and her\nardent desire to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as\nearly as possible, some token of forgiveness by me.\n\n“Forgiveness!” said Linton. “I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen. You\nmay call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that\nI am not _angry_, but I’m _sorry_ to have lost her; especially as I can\nnever think she’ll be happy. It is out of the question my going to see\nher, however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to\noblige me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the\ncountry.”\n\n“And you won’t write her a little note, sir?” I asked, imploringly.\n\n“No,” he answered. “It is needless. My communication with Heathcliff’s\nfamily shall be as sparing as his with mine. It shall not exist!”\n\nMr. Edgar’s coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the\nGrange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said,\nwhen I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines\nto console Isabella. I daresay she had been on the watch for me since\nmorning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden\ncauseway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being\nobserved. I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary,\ndismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess,\nthat if I had been in the young lady’s place, I would, at least, have\nswept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she already\npartook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her. Her\npretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging\nlankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably she\nhad not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there.\nMr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his\npocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite\nfriendly, and offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that\nseemed decent; and I thought he never looked better. So much had\ncircumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have\nstruck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a\nthorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and\nheld out one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She\nwouldn’t understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I\nwent to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her\ndirectly what I had brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her\nmanœuvres, and said—“If you have got anything for Isabella (as no\ndoubt you have, Nelly), give it to her. You needn’t make a secret of\nit: we have no secrets between us.”\n\n“Oh, I have nothing,” I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at\nonce. “My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either\na letter or a visit from him at present. He sends his love, ma’am, and\nhis wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have\noccasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the\nhousehold here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of\nkeeping it up.”\n\nMrs. Heathcliff’s lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat\nin the window. Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me,\nand began to put questions concerning Catherine. I told him as much as\nI thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by\ncross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin. I\nblamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended\nby hoping that he would follow Mr. Linton’s example and avoid future\ninterference with his family, for good or evil.\n\n“Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,” I said; “she’ll never be like she\nwas, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,\nyou’ll shun crossing her way again: nay, you’ll move out of this\ncountry entirely; and that you may not regret it, I’ll inform you\nCatherine Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine\nEarnshaw, as that young lady is different from me. Her appearance is\nchanged greatly, her character much more so; and the person who is\ncompelled, of necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his\naffection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was, by common\nhumanity, and a sense of duty!”\n\n“That is quite possible,” remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem\ncalm: “quite possible that your master should have nothing but common\nhumanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon. But do you imagine that\nI shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you\ncompare my feelings respecting Catherine to his? Before you leave this\nhouse, I must exact a promise from you that you’ll get me an interview\nwith her: consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her! What do you say?”\n\n“I say, Mr. Heathcliff,” I replied, “you must not: you never shall,\nthrough my means. Another encounter between you and the master would\nkill her altogether.”\n\n“With your aid that may be avoided,” he continued; “and should there be\ndanger of such an event—should he be the cause of adding a single\ntrouble more to her existence—why, I think I shall be justified in\ngoing to extremes! I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether\nCatherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would\nrestrains me. And there you see the distinction between our feelings:\nhad he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred\nthat turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against\nhim. You may look incredulous, if you please! I never would have\nbanished him from her society as long as she desired his. The moment\nher regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his\nblood! But, till then—if you don’t believe me, you don’t know me—till\nthen, I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his\nhead!”\n\n“And yet,” I interrupted, “you have no scruples in completely ruining\nall hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her\nremembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her\nin a new tumult of discord and distress.”\n\n“You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?” he said. “Oh, Nelly! you\nknow she has not! You know as well as I do, that for every thought she\nspends on Linton she spends a thousand on me! At a most miserable\nperiod of my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my\nreturn to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance\ncould make me admit the horrible idea again. And then, Linton would be\nnothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt. Two words\nwould comprehend my future—_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing\nher, would be hell. Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she\nvalued Edgar Linton’s attachment more than mine. If he loved with all\nthe powers of his puny being, he couldn’t love as much in eighty years\nas I could in a day. And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the\nsea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole\naffection be monopolised by him. Tush! He is scarcely a degree dearer\nto her than her dog, or her horse. It is not in him to be loved like\nme: how can she love in him what he has not?”\n\n“Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can\nbe,” cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity. “No one has a right to talk\nin that manner, and I won’t hear my brother depreciated in silence!”\n\n“Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn’t he?” observed\nHeathcliff, scornfully. “He turns you adrift on the world with\nsurprising alacrity.”\n\n“He is not aware of what I suffer,” she replied. “I didn’t tell him\nthat.”\n\n“You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have\nyou?”\n\n“To say that I was married, I did write—you saw the note.”\n\n“And nothing since?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition,”\nI remarked. “Somebody’s love comes short in her case, obviously; whose,\nI may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn’t say.”\n\n“I should guess it was her own,” said Heathcliff. “She degenerates into\na mere slut! She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.\nYou’d hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was\nweeping to go home. However, she’ll suit this house so much the better\nfor not being over nice, and I’ll take care she does not disgrace me by\nrambling abroad.”\n\n“Well, sir,” returned I, “I hope you’ll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff\nis accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been\nbrought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.\nYou must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you\nmust treat her kindly. Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot\ndoubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn’t\nhave abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former\nhome, to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.”\n\n“She abandoned them under a delusion,” he answered; “picturing in me a\nhero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous\ndevotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature,\nso obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my\ncharacter and acting on the false impressions she cherished. But, at\nlast, I think she begins to know me: I don’t perceive the silly smiles\nand grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability\nof discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her\ninfatuation and herself. It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to\ndiscover that I did not love her. I believed, at one time, no lessons\ncould teach her that! And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she\nannounced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually\nsucceeded in making her hate me! A positive labour of Hercules, I\nassure you! If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks. Can I\ntrust your assertion, Isabella? Are you sure you hate me? If I let you\nalone for half a day, won’t you come sighing and wheedling to me again?\nI daresay she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it\nwounds her vanity to have the truth exposed. But I don’t care who knows\nthat the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie\nabout it. She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful\nsoftness. The first thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange,\nwas to hang up her little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first\nwords I uttered were a wish that I had the hanging of every being\nbelonging to her, except one: possibly she took that exception for\nherself. But no brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate\nadmiration of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury!\nNow, was it not the depth of absurdity—of genuine idiocy, for that\npitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her?\nTell your master, Nelly, that I never, in all my life, met with such an\nabject thing as she is. She even disgraces the name of Linton; and I’ve\nsometimes relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on\nwhat she could endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back! But\ntell him, also, to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease:\nthat I keep strictly within the limits of the law. I have avoided, up\nto this period, giving her the slightest right to claim a separation;\nand, what’s more, she’d thank nobody for dividing us. If she desired to\ngo, she might: the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification\nto be derived from tormenting her!”\n\n“Mr. Heathcliff,” said I, “this is the talk of a madman; your wife,\nmost likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has\nborne with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she’ll\ndoubtless avail herself of the permission. You are not so bewitched,\nma’am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?”\n\n“Take care, Ellen!” answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully;\nthere was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her\npartner’s endeavours to make himself detested. “Don’t put faith in a\nsingle word he speaks. He’s a lying fiend! a monster, and not a human\nbeing! I’ve been told I might leave him before; and I’ve made the\nattempt, but I dare not repeat it! Only, Ellen, promise you’ll not\nmention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or\nCatherine. Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to\ndesperation: he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over\nhim; and he sha’n’t obtain it—I’ll die first! I just hope, I pray, that\nhe may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me! The single pleasure\nI can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!”\n\n“There—that will do for the present!” said Heathcliff. “If you are\ncalled upon in a court of law, you’ll remember her language, Nelly! And\ntake a good look at that countenance: she’s near the point which would\nsuit me. No; you’re not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and\nI, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however\ndistasteful the obligation may be. Go upstairs; I have something to say\nto Ellen Dean in private. That’s not the way: upstairs, I tell you!\nWhy, this is the road upstairs, child!”\n\nHe seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering—“I have\nno pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to\ncrush out their entrails! It is a moral teething; and I grind with\ngreater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.”\n\n“Do you understand what the word pity means?” I said, hastening to\nresume my bonnet. “Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?”\n\n“Put that down!” he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart.\n“You are not going yet. Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or\ncompel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine,\nand that without delay. I swear that I meditate no harm: I don’t desire\nto cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only\nwish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to\nask if anything that I could do would be of use to her. Last night I\nwas in the Grange garden six hours, and I’ll return there to-night; and\nevery night I’ll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an\nopportunity of entering. If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate\nto knock him down, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I\nstay. If his servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these\npistols. But wouldn’t it be better to prevent my coming in contact with\nthem, or their master? And you could do it so easily. I’d warn you when\nI came, and then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was\nalone, and watch till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would\nbe hindering mischief.”\n\nI protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer’s\nhouse: and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his\ndestroying Mrs. Linton’s tranquillity for his satisfaction. “The\ncommonest occurrence startles her painfully,” I said. “She’s all\nnerves, and she couldn’t bear the surprise, I’m positive. Don’t\npersist, sir! or else I shall be obliged to inform my master of your\ndesigns; and he’ll take measures to secure his house and its inmates\nfrom any such unwarrantable intrusions!”\n\n“In that case I’ll take measures to secure you, woman!” exclaimed\nHeathcliff; “you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow\nmorning. It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear\nto see me; and as to surprising her, I don’t desire it: you must\nprepare her—ask her if I may come. You say she never mentions my name,\nand that I am never mentioned to her. To whom should she mention me if\nI am a forbidden topic in the house? She thinks you are all spies for\nher husband. Oh, I’ve no doubt she’s in hell among you! I guess by her\nsilence, as much as anything, what she feels. You say she is often\nrestless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity? You\ntalk of her mind being unsettled. How the devil could it be otherwise\nin her frightful isolation? And that insipid, paltry creature attending\nher from _duty_ and _humanity_! From _pity_ and _charity_! He might as\nwell plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine\nhe can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares! Let us\nsettle it at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to\nCatherine over Linton and his footman? Or will you be my friend, as you\nhave been hitherto, and do what I request? Decide! because there is no\nreason for my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn\nill-nature!”\n\nWell, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him\nfifty times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement. I\nengaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she\nconsent, I promised to let him have intelligence of Linton’s next\nabsence from home, when he might come, and get in as he was able: I\nwouldn’t be there, and my fellow-servants should be equally out of the\nway. Was it right or wrong? I fear it was wrong, though expedient. I\nthought I prevented another explosion by my compliance; and I thought,\ntoo, it might create a favourable crisis in Catherine’s mental illness:\nand then I remembered Mr. Edgar’s stern rebuke of my carrying tales;\nand I tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject, by\naffirming, with frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it\nmerited so harsh an appellation, should be the last. Notwithstanding,\nmy journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither; and many\nmisgivings I had, ere I could prevail on myself to put the missive into\nMrs. Linton’s hand.\n\nBut here is Kenneth; I’ll go down, and tell him how much better you\nare. My history is _dree_, as we say, and will serve to while away\nanother morning.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDree, and dreary! I reflected as the good woman descended to receive\nthe doctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to\namuse me. But never mind! I’ll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs.\nDean’s bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that\nlurks in Catherine Heathcliff’s brilliant eyes. I should be in a\ncurious taking if I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the\ndaughter turned out a second edition of the mother.\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nAnother week over—and I am so many days nearer health, and spring! I\nhave now heard all my neighbour’s history, at different sittings, as\nthe housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations. I’ll\ncontinue it in her own words, only a little condensed. She is, on the\nwhole, a very fair narrator, and I don’t think I could improve her\nstyle.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I\nknew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place;\nand I shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my\npocket, and didn’t want to be threatened or teased any more. I had made\nup my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not\nguess how its receipt would affect Catherine. The consequence was, that\nit did not reach her before the lapse of three days. The fourth was\nSunday, and I brought it into her room after the family were gone to\nchurch. There was a man servant left to keep the house with me, and we\ngenerally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of\nservice; but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that\nI set them wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would\nbe coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much for\nsome oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a few, to be\npaid for on the morrow. He departed, and I went upstairs.\n\nMrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her\nshoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual. Her thick, long\nhair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now\nshe wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and\nneck. Her appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when\nshe was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change. The flash of\nher eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they\nno longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her:\nthey appeared always to gaze beyond, and far beyond—you would have said\nout of this world. Then, the paleness of her face—its haggard aspect\nhaving vanished as she recovered flesh—and the peculiar expression\narising from her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their\ncauses, added to the touching interest which she awakened;\nand—invariably to me, I know, and to any person who saw her, I should\nthink—refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as\none doomed to decay.\n\nA book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible\nwind fluttered its leaves at intervals. I believe Linton had laid it\nthere: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or\noccupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to\nentice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her\namusement. She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods\nendured his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and\nthen suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the\nsaddest of smiles and kisses. At other times, she would turn petulantly\naway, and hide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and\nthen he took care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no\ngood.\n\nGimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of\nthe beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear. It was a sweet\nsubstitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which\ndrowned that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf. At\nWuthering Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great\nthaw or a season of steady rain. And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was\nthinking as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all;\nbut she had the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed\nno recognition of material things either by ear or eye.\n\n“There’s a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,” I said, gently inserting it in\none hand that rested on her knee. “You must read it immediately,\nbecause it wants an answer. Shall I break the seal?” “Yes,” she\nanswered, without altering the direction of her eyes. I opened it—it\nwas very short. “Now,” I continued, “read it.” She drew away her hand,\nand let it fall. I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it\nshould please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed\nthat at last I resumed—“Must I read it, ma’am? It is from Mr.\nHeathcliff.”\n\nThere was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle\nto arrange her ideas. She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it;\nand when she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she\nhad not gathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply,\nshe merely pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and\nquestioning eagerness.\n\n“Well, he wishes to see you,” said I, guessing her need of an\ninterpreter. “He’s in the garden by this time, and impatient to know\nwhat answer I shall bring.”\n\nAs I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath\nraise its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back,\nannounce, by a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did\nnot consider a stranger. Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened\nbreathlessly. The minute after a step traversed the hall; the open\nhouse was too tempting for Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely\nhe supposed that I was inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to\ntrust to his own audacity. With straining eagerness Catherine gazed\ntowards the entrance of her chamber. He did not hit the right room\ndirectly: she motioned me to admit him, but he found it out ere I could\nreach the door, and in a stride or two was at her side, and had her\ngrasped in his arms.\n\nHe neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during\nwhich period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life\nbefore, I daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I\nplainly saw that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look\ninto her face! The same conviction had stricken him as me, from the\ninstant he beheld her, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery\nthere—she was fated, sure to die.\n\n“Oh, Cathy! Oh, my life! how can I bear it?” was the first sentence he\nuttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair. And now\nhe stared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his\ngaze would bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish:\nthey did not melt.\n\n“What now?” said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a\nsuddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly\nvarying caprices. “You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff! And\nyou both come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be\npitied! I shall not pity you, not I. You have killed me—and thriven on\nit, I think. How strong you are! How many years do you mean to live\nafter I am gone?”\n\nHeathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise,\nbut she seized his hair, and kept him down.\n\n“I wish I could hold you,” she continued, bitterly, “till we were both\ndead! I shouldn’t care what you suffered. I care nothing for your\nsufferings. Why shouldn’t you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will\nyou be happy when I am in the earth? Will you say twenty years hence,\n‘That’s the grave of Catherine Earnshaw? I loved her long ago, and was\nwretched to lose her; but it is past. I’ve loved many others since: my\nchildren are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not\nrejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave\nthem!’ Will you say so, Heathcliff?”\n\n“Don’t torture me till I’m as mad as yourself,” cried he, wrenching his\nhead free, and grinding his teeth.\n\nThe two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture. Well\nmight Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her,\nunless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also. Her\npresent countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a\nbloodless lip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed\nfingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping. As to her\ncompanion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm\nwith the other; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the\nrequirements of her condition, that on his letting go I saw four\ndistinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin.\n\n“Are you possessed with a devil,” he pursued, savagely, “to talk in\nthat manner to me when you are dying? Do you reflect that all those\nwords will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after\nyou have left me? You know you lie to say I have killed you: and,\nCatherine, you know that I could as soon forget you as my existence! Is\nit not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at\npeace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?”\n\n“I shall not be at peace,” moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of\nphysical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which\nbeat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation. She said\nnothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more\nkindly—\n\n“I’m not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff. I only\nwish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you\nhereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own\nsake, forgive me! Come here and kneel down again! You never harmed me\nin your life. Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember\nthan my harsh words! Won’t you come here again? Do!”\n\nHeathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so\nfar as to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion. She bent\nround to look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he\nwalked to the fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards\nus. Mrs. Linton’s glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke\na new sentiment in her. After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she\nresumed; addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:—\n\n“Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the\ngrave. _That_ is how I’m loved! Well, never mind. That is not _my_\nHeathcliff. I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he’s in my\nsoul. And,” added she musingly, “the thing that irks me most is this\nshattered prison, after all. I’m tired of being enclosed here. I’m\nwearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there:\nnot seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the\nwalls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it. Nelly, you\nthink you are better and more fortunate than I; in full health and\nstrength: you are sorry for me—very soon that will be altered. I shall\nbe sorry for _you_. I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all. I\n_wonder_ he won’t be near me!” She went on to herself. “I thought he\nwished it. Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen now. Do come to\nme, Heathcliff.”\n\nIn her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the\nchair. At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely\ndesperate. His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his\nbreast heaved convulsively. An instant they held asunder, and then how\nthey met I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her,\nand they were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress\nwould never be released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly\ninsensible. He flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my\napproaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at\nme, and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him with greedy\njealousy. I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of\nmy own species: it appeared that he would not understand, though I\nspoke to him; so I stood off, and held my tongue, in great perplexity.\n\nA movement of Catherine’s relieved me a little presently: she put up\nher hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her;\nwhile he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly—\n\n“You teach me now how cruel you’ve been—cruel and false. _Why_ did you\ndespise me? _Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one\nword of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you\nmay kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they’ll blight\nyou—they’ll damn you. You loved me—then what _right_ had you to leave\nme? What right—answer me—for the poor fancy you felt for Linton?\nBecause misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or\nSatan could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did\nit. I have not broken your heart—_you_ have broken it; and in breaking\nit, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do\nI want to live? What kind of living will it be when you—oh, God! would\n_you_ like to live with your soul in the grave?”\n\n“Let me alone. Let me alone,” sobbed Catherine. “If I’ve done wrong,\nI’m dying for it. It is enough! You left me too: but I won’t upbraid\nyou! I forgive you. Forgive me!”\n\n“It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those\nwasted hands,” he answered. “Kiss me again; and don’t let me see your\neyes! I forgive what you have done to me. I love _my_ murderer—but\n_yours_! How can I?”\n\nThey were silent—their faces hid against each other, and washed by each\nother’s tears. At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it\nseemed Heathcliff _could_ weep on a great occasion like this.\n\nI grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,\nthe man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could\ndistinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse\nthickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.\n\n“Service is over,” I announced. “My master will be here in half an\nhour.”\n\nHeathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she never\nmoved.\n\nEre long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road\ntowards the kitchen wing. Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the\ngate himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely\nafternoon that breathed as soft as summer.\n\n“Now he is here,” I exclaimed. “For heaven’s sake, hurry down! You’ll\nnot meet any one on the front stairs. Do be quick; and stay among the\ntrees till he is fairly in.”\n\n“I must go, Cathy,” said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from\nhis companion’s arms. “But if I live, I’ll see you again before you are\nasleep. I won’t stray five yards from your window.”\n\n“You must not go!” she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength\nallowed. “You _shall_ not, I tell you.”\n\n“For one hour,” he pleaded earnestly.\n\n“Not for one minute,” she replied.\n\n“I _must_—Linton will be up immediately,” persisted the alarmed\nintruder.\n\nHe would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act—she clung fast,\ngasping: there was mad resolution in her face.\n\n“No!” she shrieked. “Oh, don’t, don’t go. It is the last time! Edgar\nwill not hurt us. Heathcliff, I shall die! I shall die!”\n\n“Damn the fool! There he is,” cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his\nseat. “Hush, my darling! Hush, hush, Catherine! I’ll stay. If he shot\nme so, I’d expire with a blessing on my lips.”\n\nAnd there they were fast again. I heard my master mounting the\nstairs—the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.\n\n“Are you going to listen to her ravings?” I said, passionately. “She\ndoes not know what she says. Will you ruin her, because she has not wit\nto help herself? Get up! You could be free instantly. That is the most\ndiabolical deed that ever you did. We are all done for—master,\nmistress, and servant.”\n\nI wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at\nthe noise. In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to\nobserve that Catherine’s arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung\ndown.\n\n“She’s fainted, or dead,” I thought: “so much the better. Far better\nthat she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to\nall about her.”\n\nEdgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and\nrage. What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all\ndemonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless-looking form in his\narms.\n\n“Look there!” he said. “Unless you be a fiend, help her first—then you\nshall speak to me!”\n\nHe walked into the parlour, and sat down. Mr. Linton summoned me, and\nwith great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to\nrestore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and\nmoaned, and knew nobody. Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her\nhated friend. I did not. I went, at the earliest opportunity, and\nbesought him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he\nshould hear from me in the morning how she passed the night.\n\n“I shall not refuse to go out of doors,” he answered; “but I shall stay\nin the garden: and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow. I shall\nbe under those larch-trees. Mind! or I pay another visit, whether\nLinton be in or not.”\n\nHe sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and,\nascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the\nhouse of his luckless presence.\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nAbout twelve o’clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at\nWuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months’ child; and two hours after the\nmother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss\nHeathcliff, or know Edgar. The latter’s distraction at his bereavement\nis a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how\ndeep the sorrow sunk. A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left\nwithout an heir. I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and\nI mentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the\nsecuring his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son’s. An\nunwelcomed infant it was, poor thing! It might have wailed out of life,\nand nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence. We\nredeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as\nits end is likely to be.\n\nNext morning—bright and cheerful out of doors—stole softened in through\nthe blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant\nwith a mellow, tender glow. Edgar Linton had his head laid on the\npillow, and his eyes shut. His young and fair features were almost as\ndeathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but\n_his_ was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace.\nHer brow smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a\nsmile; no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.\nAnd I partook of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never\nin a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine\nrest. I instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours\nbefore: “Incomparably beyond and above us all! Whether still on earth\nor now in heaven, her spirit is at home with God!”\n\nI don’t know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise\nthan happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied\nor despairing mourner share the duty with me. I see a repose that\nneither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the\nendless and shadowless hereafter—the Eternity they have entered—where\nlife is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in\nits fulness. I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is\neven in a love like Mr. Linton’s, when he so regretted Catherine’s\nblessed release! To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward\nand impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of\npeace at last. One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not\nthen, in the presence of her corpse. It asserted its own tranquillity,\nwhich seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.\n\nDo you believe such people _are_ happy in the other world, sir? I’d\ngive a great deal to know.\n\nI declined answering Mrs. Dean’s question, which struck me as something\nheterodox. She proceeded:\n\nRetracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to\nthink she is; but we’ll leave her with her Maker.\n\nThe master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the\nroom and steal out to the pure refreshing air. The servants thought me\ngone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my\nchief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff. If he had remained among the\nlarches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the\nGrange; unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger\ngoing to Gimmerton. If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware,\nfrom the lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of\nthe outer doors, that all was not right within. I wished, yet feared,\nto find him. I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get\nit over; but _how_ to do it I did not know. He was there—at least, a\nfew yards further in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat\noff, and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded\nbranches, and fell pattering round him. He had been standing a long\ntime in that position, for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing\nscarcely three feet from him, busy in building their nest, and\nregarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber. They\nflew off at my approach, and he raised his eyes and spoke:—“She’s\ndead!” he said; “I’ve not waited for you to learn that. Put your\nhandkerchief away—don’t snivel before me. Damn you all! she wants none\nof _your_ tears!”\n\nI was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures\nthat have none of the feeling either for themselves or others. When I\nfirst looked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of\nthe catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was\nquelled and he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on\nthe ground.\n\n“Yes, she’s dead!” I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks.\n“Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take\ndue warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!”\n\n“Did _she_ take due warning, then?” asked Heathcliff, attempting a\nsneer. “Did she die like a saint? Come, give me a true history of the\nevent. How did—?”\n\nHe endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and\ncompressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony,\ndefying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare.\n“How did she die?” he resumed, at last—fain, notwithstanding his\nhardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he\ntrembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.\n\n“Poor wretch!” I thought; “you have a heart and nerves the same as your\nbrother men! Why should you be anxious to conceal them? Your pride\ncannot blind God! You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of\nhumiliation.”\n\n“Quietly as a lamb!” I answered, aloud. “She drew a sigh, and stretched\nherself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five\nminutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!”\n\n“And—did she ever mention me?” he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded\nthe answer to his question would introduce details that he could not\nbear to hear.\n\n“Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you\nleft her,” I said. “She lies with a sweet smile on her face; and her\nlatest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days. Her life closed in a\ngentle dream—may she wake as kindly in the other world!”\n\n“May she wake in torment!” he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping\nhis foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion.\n“Why, she’s a liar to the end! Where is she? Not _there_—not in\nheaven—not perished—where? Oh! you said you cared nothing for my\nsufferings! And I pray one prayer—I repeat it till my tongue\nstiffens—Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living;\nyou said I killed you—haunt me, then! The murdered _do_ haunt their\nmurderers, I believe. I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth. Be\nwith me always—take any form—drive me mad! only _do_ not leave me in\nthis abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I\n_cannot_ live without my life! I _cannot_ live without my soul!”\n\nHe dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes,\nhowled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death\nwith knives and spears. I observed several splashes of blood about the\nbark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably\nthe scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the\nnight. It hardly moved my compassion—it appalled me: still, I felt\nreluctant to quit him so. But the moment he recollected himself enough\nto notice me watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I\nobeyed. He was beyond my skill to quiet or console!\n\nMrs. Linton’s funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday\nfollowing her decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and\nstrewn with flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room.\nLinton spent his days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and—a\ncircumstance concealed from all but me—Heathcliff spent his nights, at\nleast, outside, equally a stranger to repose. I held no communication\nwith him; still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could;\nand on the Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer\nfatigue, had been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and\nopened one of the windows; moved by his perseverance to give him a\nchance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu. He\ndid not omit to avail himself of the opportunity, cautiously and\nbriefly; too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise.\nIndeed, I shouldn’t have discovered that he had been there, except for\nthe disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse’s face, and for\nobserving on the floor a curl of light hair, fastened with a silver\nthread; which, on examination, I ascertained to have been taken from a\nlocket hung round Catherine’s neck. Heathcliff had opened the trinket\nand cast out its contents, replacing them by a black lock of his own. I\ntwisted the two, and enclosed them together.\n\nMr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his\nsister to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that,\nbesides her husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and\nservants. Isabella was not asked.\n\nThe place of Catherine’s interment, to the surprise of the villagers,\nwas neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor\nyet by the tombs of her own relations, outside. It was dug on a green\nslope in a corner of the kirkyard, where the wall is so low that heath\nand bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould\nalmost buries it. Her husband lies in the same spot now; and they have\neach a simple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to\nmark the graves.\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nThat Friday made the last of our fine days for a month. In the evening\nthe weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and\nbrought rain first, and then sleet and snow. On the morrow one could\nhardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses\nand crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent,\nthe young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened. And dreary,\nand chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over! My master kept his\nroom; I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a\nnursery: and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid\non my knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still\ndriving flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened,\nand some person entered, out of breath and laughing! My anger was\ngreater than my astonishment for a minute. I supposed it one of the\nmaids, and I cried—“Have done! How dare you show your giddiness here?\nWhat would Mr. Linton say if he heard you?”\n\n“Excuse me!” answered a familiar voice; “but I know Edgar is in bed,\nand I cannot stop myself.”\n\nWith that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her\nhand to her side.\n\n“I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!” she continued, after\na pause; “except where I’ve flown. I couldn’t count the number of falls\nI’ve had. Oh, I’m aching all over! Don’t be alarmed! There shall be an\nexplanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to\nstep out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a\nservant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.”\n\nThe intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff. She certainly seemed in no laughing\npredicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and\nwater; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore,\nbefitting her age more than her position: a low frock with short\nsleeves, and nothing on either head or neck. The frock was of light\nsilk, and clung to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by\nthin slippers; add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the\ncold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and\nbruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue; and\nyou may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when I had had\nleisure to examine her.\n\n“My dear young lady,” I exclaimed, “I’ll stir nowhere, and hear\nnothing, till you have removed every article of your clothes, and put\non dry things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so\nit is needless to order the carriage.”\n\n“Certainly I shall,” she said; “walking or riding: yet I’ve no\nobjection to dress myself decently. And—ah, see how it flows down my\nneck now! The fire does make it smart.”\n\nShe insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would let me\ntouch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get\nready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain\nher consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.\n\n“Now, Ellen,” she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in\nan easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her, “you sit\ndown opposite me, and put poor Catherine’s baby away: I don’t like to\nsee it! You mustn’t think I care little for Catherine, because I\nbehaved so foolishly on entering: I’ve cried, too, bitterly—yes, more\nthan any one else has reason to cry. We parted unreconciled, you\nremember, and I sha’n’t forgive myself. But, for all that, I was not\ngoing to sympathise with him—the brute beast! Oh, give me the poker!\nThis is the last thing of his I have about me:” she slipped the gold\nring from her third finger, and threw it on the floor. “I’ll smash it!”\nshe continued, striking it with childish spite, “and then I’ll burn\nit!” and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals.\n“There! he shall buy another, if he gets me back again. He’d be capable\nof coming to seek me, to tease Edgar. I dare not stay, lest that notion\nshould possess his wicked head! And besides, Edgar has not been kind,\nhas he? And I won’t come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him\ninto more trouble. Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though,\nif I had not learned he was out of the way, I’d have halted at the\nkitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted,\nand departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed—of that\nincarnate goblin! Ah, he was in such a fury! If he had caught me! It’s\na pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I wouldn’t have run till\nI’d seen him all but demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!”\n\n“Well, don’t talk so fast, Miss!” I interrupted; “you’ll disorder the\nhandkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.\nDrink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is\nsadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!”\n\n“An undeniable truth,” she replied. “Listen to that child! It maintains\na constant wail—send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha’n’t stay\nany longer.”\n\nI rang the bell, and committed it to a servant’s care; and then I\ninquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an\nunlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused remaining\nwith us.\n\n“I ought, and I wished to remain,” answered she, “to cheer Edgar and\ntake care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my\nright home. But I tell you he wouldn’t let me! Do you think he could\nbear to see me grow fat and merry—could bear to think that we were\ntranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort? Now, I have the\nsatisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to the point of its\nannoying him seriously to have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I\nnotice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of his countenance are\ninvoluntarily distorted into an expression of hatred; partly arising\nfrom his knowledge of the good causes I have to feel that sentiment for\nhim, and partly from original aversion. It is strong enough to make me\nfeel pretty certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing\nI contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite away. I’ve\nrecovered from my first desire to be killed by him: I’d rather he’d\nkill himself! He has extinguished my love effectually, and so I’m at my\nease. I can recollect yet how I loved him; and can dimly imagine that I\ncould still be loving him, if—no, no! Even if he had doted on me, the\ndevilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow. Catherine\nhad an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so\nwell. Monster! would that he could be blotted out of creation, and out\nof my memory!”\n\n“Hush, hush! He’s a human being,” I said. “Be more charitable: there\nare worse men than he is yet!”\n\n“He’s not a human being,” she retorted; “and he has no claim on my\ncharity. I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and\nflung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he\nhas destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not,\nthough he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood\nfor Catherine! No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn’t!” And here Isabella began\nto cry; but, immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she\nrecommenced. “You asked, what has driven me to flight at last? I was\ncompelled to attempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a\npitch above his malignity. Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers\nrequires more coolness than knocking on the head. He was worked up to\nforget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous\nviolence. I experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him: the\nsense of pleasure woke my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly\nbroke free; and if ever I come into his hands again he is welcome to a\nsignal revenge.\n\n“Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral. He\nkept himself sober for the purpose—tolerably sober: not going to bed\nmad at six o’clock and getting up drunk at twelve. Consequently, he\nrose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance;\nand instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by\ntumblerfuls.\n\n“Heathcliff—I shudder to name him! has been a stranger in the house\nfrom last Sunday till to-day. Whether the angels have fed him, or his\nkin beneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for\nnearly a week. He has just come home at dawn, and gone upstairs to his\nchamber; locking himself in—as if anybody dreamt of coveting his\ncompany! There he has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the\ndeity he implored is senseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed,\nwas curiously confounded with his own black father! After concluding\nthese precious orisons—and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse\nand his voice was strangled in his throat—he would be off again; always\nstraight down to the Grange! I wonder Edgar did not send for a\nconstable, and give him into custody! For me, grieved as I was about\nCatherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of\ndeliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday.\n\n“I recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph’s eternal lectures\nwithout weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot\nof a frightened thief than formerly. You wouldn’t think that I should\ncry at anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable\ncompanions. I’d rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than\nwith ‘t’ little maister’ and his staunch supporter, that odious old\nman! When Heathcliff is in, I’m often obliged to seek the kitchen and\ntheir society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he\nis not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one\ncorner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy\nhimself; and he does not interfere with my arrangements. He is quieter\nnow than he used to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and\ndepressed, and less furious. Joseph affirms he’s sure he’s an altered\nman: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved ‘so as by\nfire.’ I’m puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change: but it is\nnot my business.\n\n“Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on\ntowards twelve. It seemed so dismal to go upstairs, with the wild snow\nblowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard\nand the new-made grave! I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page\nbefore me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.\nHindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on\nthe same subject. He had ceased drinking at a point below\nirrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three\nhours. There was no sound through the house but the moaning wind, which\nshook the windows every now and then, the faint crackling of the coals,\nand the click of my snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of\nthe candle. Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. It was\nvery, very sad: and while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy\nhad vanished from the world, never to be restored.\n\n“The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen\nlatch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual;\nowing, I suppose, to the sudden storm. That entrance was fastened, and\nwe heard him coming round to get in by the other. I rose with an\nirrepressible expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my\ncompanion, who had been staring towards the door, to turn and look at\nme.\n\n“‘I’ll keep him out five minutes,’ he exclaimed. ‘You won’t object?’\n\n“‘No, you may keep him out the whole night for me,’ I answered. ‘Do!\nput the key in the lock, and draw the bolts.’\n\n“Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he then\ncame and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over\nit, and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that\ngleamed from his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, he\ncouldn’t exactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage him\nto speak.\n\n“‘You, and I,’ he said, ‘have each a great debt to settle with the man\nout yonder! If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to\ndischarge it. Are you as soft as your brother? Are you willing to\nendure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?’\n\n“‘I’m weary of enduring now,’ I replied; ‘and I’d be glad of a\nretaliation that wouldn’t recoil on myself; but treachery and violence\nare spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them\nworse than their enemies.’\n\n“‘Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!’\ncried Hindley. ‘Mrs. Heathcliff, I’ll ask you to do nothing; but sit\nstill and be dumb. Tell me now, can you? I’m sure you would have as\nmuch pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend’s\nexistence; he’ll be _your_ death unless you overreach him; and he’ll be\n_my_ ruin. Damn the hellish villain! He knocks at the door as if he\nwere master here already! Promise to hold your tongue, and before that\nclock strikes—it wants three minutes of one—you’re a free woman!’\n\n“He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his\nbreast, and would have turned down the candle. I snatched it away,\nhowever, and seized his arm.\n\n“‘I’ll not hold my tongue!’ I said; ‘you mustn’t touch him. Let the\ndoor remain shut, and be quiet!’\n\n“‘No! I’ve formed my resolution, and by God I’ll execute it!’ cried the\ndesperate being. ‘I’ll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and\nHareton justice! And you needn’t trouble your head to screen me;\nCatherine is gone. Nobody alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though\nI cut my throat this minute—and it’s time to make an end!’\n\n“I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a\nlunatic. The only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his\nintended victim of the fate which awaited him.\n\n“‘You’d better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!’ I exclaimed, in\nrather a triumphant tone. ‘Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you\npersist in endeavouring to enter.’\n\n“‘You’d better open the door, you—’ he answered, addressing me by some\nelegant term that I don’t care to repeat.\n\n“‘I shall not meddle in the matter,’ I retorted again. ‘Come in and get\nshot, if you please. I’ve done my duty.’\n\n“With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire;\nhaving too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any\nanxiety for the danger that menaced him. Earnshaw swore passionately at\nme: affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of\nnames for the base spirit I evinced. And I, in my secret heart (and\nconscience never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be\nfor _him_ should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a blessing\nfor _me_ should he send Heathcliff to his right abode! As I sat nursing\nthese reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by\na blow from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked\nblightingly through. The stanchions stood too close to suffer his\nshoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security. His\nhair and clothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth,\nrevealed by cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark.\n\n“‘Isabella, let me in, or I’ll make you repent!’ he ‘girned,’ as Joseph\ncalls it.\n\n“‘I cannot commit murder,’ I replied. ‘Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with\na knife and loaded pistol.’\n\n“‘Let me in by the kitchen door,’ he said.\n\n“‘Hindley will be there before me,’ I answered: ‘and that’s a poor love\nof yours that cannot bear a shower of snow! We were left at peace in\nour beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of\nwinter returns, you must run for shelter! Heathcliff, if I were you,\nI’d go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog. The\nworld is surely not worth living in now, is it? You had distinctly\nimpressed on me the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life:\nI can’t imagine how you think of surviving her loss.’\n\n“‘He’s there, is he?’ exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap. ‘If I\ncan get my arm out I can hit him!’\n\n“I’m afraid, Ellen, you’ll set me down as really wicked; but you don’t\nknow all, so don’t judge. I wouldn’t have aided or abetted an attempt\non even _his_ life for anything. Wish that he were dead, I must; and\ntherefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the\nconsequences of my taunting speech, when he flung himself on Earnshaw’s\nweapon and wrenched it from his grasp.\n\n“The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its\nowner’s wrist. Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the\nflesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket. He then\ntook a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang\nin. His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow\nof blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein. The ruffian\nkicked and trampled on him, and dashed his head repeatedly against the\nflags, holding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning\nJoseph. He exerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing\nhim completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and\ndragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle. There he tore\noff the sleeve of Earnshaw’s coat, and bound up the wound with brutal\nroughness; spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically\nas he had kicked before. Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking\nthe old servant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my\nhasty tale, hurried below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at\nonce.\n\n“‘What is ther to do, now? what is ther to do, now?’\n\n“‘There’s this to do,’ thundered Heathcliff, ‘that your master’s mad;\nand should he last another month, I’ll have him to an asylum. And how\nthe devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound? Don’t\nstand muttering and mumbling there. Come, I’m not going to nurse him.\nWash that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle—it is more\nthan half brandy!’\n\n“‘And so ye’ve been murthering on him?’ exclaimed Joseph, lifting his\nhands and eyes in horror. ‘If iver I seed a seeght loike this! May the\nLord—’\n\n“Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood,\nand flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he\njoined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its\nodd phraseology. I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at\nnothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves\nat the foot of the gallows.\n\n“‘Oh, I forgot you,’ said the tyrant. ‘You shall do that. Down with\nyou. And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper? There, that\nis work fit for you!’\n\n“He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who\nsteadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would\nset off for the Grange directly. Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and\nthough he had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this. He was so\nobstinate in his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to\ncompel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing\nover me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the\naccount in answer to his questions. It required a great deal of labour\nto satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was not the aggressor;\nespecially with my hardly-wrung replies. However, Mr. Earnshaw soon\nconvinced him that he was alive still; Joseph hastened to administer a\ndose of spirits, and by their succour his master presently regained\nmotion and consciousness. Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was\nignorant of the treatment received while insensible, called him\ndeliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice his atrocious\nconduct further, but advised him to get to bed. To my joy, he left us,\nafter giving this judicious counsel, and Hindley stretched himself on\nthe hearthstone. I departed to my own room, marvelling that I had\nescaped so easily.\n\n“This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr.\nEarnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost\nas gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney. Neither appeared\ninclined to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I\ncommenced alone. Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I\nexperienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at\nintervals, I cast a look towards my silent companions, and felt the\ncomfort of a quiet conscience within me. After I had done, I ventured\non the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw’s\nseat, and kneeling in the corner beside him.\n\n“Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his\nfeatures almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone. His\nforehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so\ndiabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were\nnearly quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes\nwere wet then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in\nan expression of unspeakable sadness. Had it been another, I would have\ncovered my face in the presence of such grief. In _his_ case, I was\ngratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I\ncouldn’t miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the\nonly time when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.”\n\n“Fie, fie, Miss!” I interrupted. “One might suppose you had never\nopened a Bible in your life. If God afflict your enemies, surely that\nought to suffice you. It is both mean and presumptuous to add your\ntorture to his!”\n\n“In general I’ll allow that it would be, Ellen,” she continued; “but\nwhat misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand\nin it? I’d rather he suffered _less_, if I might cause his sufferings\nand he might _know_ that I was the cause. Oh, I owe him so much. On\nonly one condition can I hope to forgive him. It is, if I may take an\neye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a\nwrench: reduce him to my level. As he was the first to injure, make him\nthe first to implore pardon; and then—why then, Ellen, I might show you\nsome generosity. But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged,\nand therefore I cannot forgive him. Hindley wanted some water, and I\nhanded him a glass, and asked him how he was.\n\n“‘Not as ill as I wish,’ he replied. ‘But leaving out my arm, every\ninch of me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps!’\n\n“‘Yes, no wonder,’ was my next remark. ‘Catherine used to boast that\nshe stood between you and bodily harm: she meant that certain persons\nwould not hurt you for fear of offending her. It’s well people don’t\n_really_ rise from their grave, or, last night, she might have\nwitnessed a repulsive scene! Are not you bruised, and cut over your\nchest and shoulders?’\n\n“‘I can’t say,’ he answered; ‘but what do you mean? Did he dare to\nstrike me when I was down?’\n\n“‘He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground,’ I\nwhispered. ‘And his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth; because\nhe’s only half man: not so much, and the rest fiend.’\n\n“Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe;\nwho, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him:\nthe longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their\nblackness through his features.\n\n“‘Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in my last\nagony, I’d go to hell with joy,’ groaned the impatient man, writhing to\nrise, and sinking back in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the\nstruggle.\n\n“‘Nay, it’s enough that he has murdered one of you,’ I observed aloud.\n‘At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now\nhad it not been for Mr. Heathcliff. After all, it is preferable to be\nhated than loved by him. When I recollect how happy we were—how happy\nCatherine was before he came—I’m fit to curse the day.’\n\n“Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than\nthe spirit of the person who said it. His attention was roused, I saw,\nfor his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath\nin suffocating sighs. I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully. The\nclouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which\nusually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not\nfear to hazard another sound of derision.\n\n“‘Get up, and begone out of my sight,’ said the mourner.\n\n“I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his voice was\nhardly intelligible.\n\n“‘I beg your pardon,’ I replied. ‘But I loved Catherine too; and her\nbrother requires attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply. Now\nthat she’s dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her eyes, if\nyou had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red; and\nher—’\n\n“‘Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!’ he cried,\nmaking a movement that caused me to make one also.\n\n“‘But then,’ I continued, holding myself ready to flee, ‘if poor\nCatherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible,\ndegrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a\nsimilar picture! _She_ wouldn’t have borne your abominable behaviour\nquietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice.’\n\n“The back of the settle and Earnshaw’s person interposed between me and\nhim; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife\nfrom the table and flung it at my head. It struck beneath my ear, and\nstopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to\nthe door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than\nhis missile. The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his\npart, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together\non the hearth. In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to\nhis master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies\nfrom a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from\npurgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,\nquitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks,\nand wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the\nbeacon-light of the Grange. And far rather would I be condemned to a\nperpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night,\nabide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.”\n\nIsabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and\nbidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and\nturning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she\nstepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar’s and Catherine’s portraits,\nbestowed a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage,\naccompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her\nmistress. She was driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but\na regular correspondence was established between her and my master when\nthings were more settled. I believe her new abode was in the south,\nnear London; there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her\nescape. He was christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him\nto be an ailing, peevish creature.\n\nMr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she\nlived. I refused to tell. He remarked that it was not of any moment,\nonly she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with\nhim, if he had to keep her himself. Though I would give no information,\nhe discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of\nresidence and the existence of the child. Still, he didn’t molest her:\nfor which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose. He often\nasked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled\ngrimly, and observed: “They wish me to hate it too, do they?”\n\n“I don’t think they wish you to know anything about it,” I answered.\n\n“But I’ll have it,” he said, “when I want it. They may reckon on that!”\n\nFortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen\nyears after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a\nlittle more.\n\nOn the day succeeding Isabella’s unexpected visit I had no opportunity\nof speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for\ndiscussing nothing. When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased\nhim that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an\nintensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to\nallow. So deep and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from\ngoing anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief,\nand that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up\nhis office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the\nvillage on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within\nthe limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on\nthe moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or\nearly morning before other wanderers were abroad. But he was too good\nto be thoroughly unhappy long. _He_ didn’t pray for Catherine’s soul to\nhaunt him. Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than\ncommon joy. He recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and\nhopeful aspiring to the better world; where he doubted not she was\ngone.\n\nAnd he had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, I\nsaid, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that\ncoldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could\nstammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot’s sceptre in his\nheart. It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full,\nas he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because\nHeathcliff had a habit of doing so. The little one was always Cathy: it\nformed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with\nher; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than\nfrom its being his own.\n\nI used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and\nperplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so\nopposite in similar circumstances. They had both been fond husbands,\nand were both attached to their children; and I could not see how they\nshouldn’t both have taken the same road, for good or evil. But, I\nthought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has\nshown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man. When his ship struck,\nthe captain abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save\nher, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless\nvessel. Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal\nand faithful soul: he trusted God; and God comforted him. One hoped,\nand the other despaired: they chose their own lots, and were\nrighteously doomed to endure them. But you’ll not want to hear my\nmoralising, Mr. Lockwood; you’ll judge, as well as I can, all these\nthings: at least, you’ll think you will, and that’s the same. The end\nof Earnshaw was what might have been expected; it followed fast on his\nsister’s: there were scarcely six months between them. We, at the\nGrange, never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it;\nall that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the\npreparations for the funeral. Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to\nmy master.\n\n“Well, Nelly,” said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not\nto alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, “it’s yours and\nmy turn to go into mourning at present. Who’s given us the slip now, do\nyou think?”\n\n“Who?” I asked in a flurry.\n\n“Why, guess!” he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a\nhook by the door. “And nip up the corner of your apron: I’m certain\nyou’ll need it.”\n\n“Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?” I exclaimed.\n\n“What! would you have tears for him?” said the doctor. “No,\nHeathcliff’s a tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day. I’ve just\nseen him. He’s rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.”\n\n“Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?” I repeated impatiently.\n\n“Hindley Earnshaw! Your old friend Hindley,” he replied, “and my wicked\ngossip: though he’s been too wild for me this long while. There! I said\nwe should draw water. But cheer up! He died true to his character:\ndrunk as a lord. Poor lad! I’m sorry, too. One can’t help missing an\nold companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man\nimagined, and has done me many a rascally turn. He’s barely\ntwenty-seven, it seems; that’s your own age: who would have thought you\nwere born in one year?”\n\nI confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton’s\ndeath: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the\nporch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get\nanother servant to introduce him to the master. I could not hinder\nmyself from pondering on the question—“Had he had fair play?” Whatever\nI did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious\nthat I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and\nassist in the last duties to the dead. Mr. Linton was extremely\nreluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless\ncondition in which he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother\nhad a claim on my services as strong as his own. Besides, I reminded\nhim that the child Hareton was his wife’s nephew, and, in the absence\nof nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and\nmust inquire how the property was left, and look over the concerns of\nhis brother-in-law. He was unfit for attending to such matters then,\nbut he bid me speak to his lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.\nHis lawyer had been Earnshaw’s also: I called at the village, and asked\nhim to accompany me. He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff\nshould be let alone; affirming, if the truth were known, Hareton would\nbe found little else than a beggar.\n\n“His father died in debt,” he said; “the whole property is mortgaged,\nand the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity\nof creating some interest in the creditor’s heart, that he may be\ninclined to deal leniently towards him.”\n\nWhen I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see\neverything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient\ndistress, expressed satisfaction at my presence. Mr. Heathcliff said he\ndid not perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the\narrangements for the funeral, if I chose.\n\n“Correctly,” he remarked, “that fool’s body should be buried at the\ncross-roads, without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave him ten\nminutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two\ndoors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking\nhimself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, for we heard\nhim snorting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle:\nflaying and scalping would not have wakened him. I sent for Kenneth,\nand he came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was\nboth dead and cold, and stark; and so you’ll allow it was useless\nmaking more stir about him!”\n\nThe old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:\n\n“I’d rayther he’d goan hisseln for t’ doctor! I sud ha’ taen tent o’ t’\nmaister better nor him—and he warn’t deead when I left, naught o’ t’\nsoart!”\n\nI insisted on the funeral being respectable. Mr. Heathcliff said I\nmight have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that\nthe money for the whole affair came out of his pocket. He maintained a\nhard, careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if\nanything, it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult\nwork successfully executed. I observed once, indeed, something like\nexultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the\ncoffin from the house. He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and\nprevious to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on\nto the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, “Now, my bonny lad, you\nare _mine_! And we’ll see if one tree won’t grow as crooked as another,\nwith the same wind to twist it!” The unsuspecting thing was pleased at\nthis speech: he played with Heathcliff’s whiskers, and stroked his\ncheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, “That boy must\ngo back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir. There is nothing in the\nworld less yours than he is!”\n\n“Does Linton say so?” he demanded.\n\n“Of course—he has ordered me to take him,” I replied.\n\n“Well,” said the scoundrel, “we’ll not argue the subject now: but I\nhave a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your\nmaster that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt\nto remove it. I don’t engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I’ll be\npretty sure to make the other come! Remember to tell him.”\n\nThis hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated its substance on my\nreturn; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke\nno more of interfering. I’m not aware that he could have done it to any\npurpose, had he been ever so willing.\n\nThe guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm\npossession, and proved to the attorney—who, in his turn, proved it to\nMr. Linton—that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for\ncash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the\nmortgagee. In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first\ngentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete\ndependence on his father’s inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house\nas a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right\nhimself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has\nbeen wronged.\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nThe twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period\nwere the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage\nrose from our little lady’s trifling illnesses, which she had to\nexperience in common with all children, rich and poor. For the rest,\nafter the first six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and\ntalk too, in her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over\nMrs. Linton’s dust. She was the most winning thing that ever brought\nsunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the\nEarnshaws’ handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons’ fair skin and small\nfeatures, and yellow curling hair. Her spirit was high, though not\nrough, and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its\naffections. That capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her\nmother: still she did not resemble her: for she could be soft and mild\nas a dove, and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression: her anger\nwas never furious; her love never fierce: it was deep and tender.\nHowever, it must be acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts. A\npropensity to be saucy was one; and a perverse will, that indulged\nchildren invariably acquire, whether they be good tempered or cross. If\na servant chanced to vex her, it was always—“I shall tell papa!” And if\nhe reproved her, even by a look, you would have thought it a\nheart-breaking business: I don’t believe he ever did speak a harsh word\nto her. He took her education entirely on himself, and made it an\namusement. Fortunately, curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt\nscholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and did honour to his\nteaching.\n\nTill she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the\nrange of the park by herself. Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile\nor so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.\nGimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only\nbuilding she had approached or entered, except her own home. Wuthering\nHeights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect\nrecluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented. Sometimes, indeed, while\nsurveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe—\n\n“Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those\nhills? I wonder what lies on the other side—is it the sea?”\n\n“No, Miss Cathy,” I would answer; “it is hills again, just like these.”\n\n“And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?” she\nonce asked.\n\nThe abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her\nnotice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost\nheights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow. I\nexplained that they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth\nin their clefts to nourish a stunted tree.\n\n“And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?” she\npursued.\n\n“Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,” replied I; “you\ncould not climb them, they are too high and steep. In winter the frost\nis always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have\nfound snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!”\n\n“Oh, you have been on them!” she cried gleefully. “Then I can go, too,\nwhen I am a woman. Has papa been, Ellen?”\n\n“Papa would tell you, Miss,” I answered, hastily, “that they are not\nworth the trouble of visiting. The moors, where you ramble with him,\nare much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.”\n\n“But I know the park, and I don’t know those,” she murmured to herself.\n“And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest\npoint: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.”\n\nOne of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with\na desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he\npromised she should have the journey when she got older. But Miss\nCatherine measured her age by months, and, “Now, am I old enough to go\nto Penistone Crags?” was the constant question in her mouth. The road\nthither wound close by Wuthering Heights. Edgar had not the heart to\npass it; so she received as constantly the answer, “Not yet, love: not\nyet.”\n\nI said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her\nhusband. Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both\nlacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.\nWhat her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of\nthe same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but\nincurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the close. She wrote to\ninform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months’\nindisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated him to come\nto her, if possible; for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid\nhim adieu, and deliver Linton safely into his hands. Her hope was that\nLinton might be left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she\nwould fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his\nmaintenance or education. My master hesitated not a moment in complying\nwith her request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls,\nhe flew to answer this; commending Catherine to my peculiar vigilance,\nin his absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of\nthe park, even under my escort: he did not calculate on her going\nunaccompanied.\n\nHe was away three weeks. The first day or two my charge sat in a corner\nof the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet\nstate she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval\nof impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then,\nto run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might\nentertain herself. I used to send her on her travels round the\ngrounds—now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient\naudience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.\n\nThe summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this\nsolitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast\ntill tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful\ntales. I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were\ngenerally locked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone,\nif they had stood wide open. Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.\nCatherine came to me, one morning, at eight o’clock, and said she was\nthat day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his\ncaravan; and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and\nbeasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by a large hound and a\ncouple of pointers. I got together good store of dainties, and slung\nthem in a basket on one side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as\na fairy, sheltered by her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July\nsun, and trotted off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to\navoid galloping, and come back early. The naughty thing never made her\nappearance at tea. One traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond\nof its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two\npointers were visible in any direction: I despatched emissaries down\nthis path, and that path, and at last went wandering in search of her\nmyself. There was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on\nthe borders of the grounds. I inquired of him if he had seen our young\nlady.\n\n“I saw her at morn,” he replied: “she would have me to cut her a hazel\nswitch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it\nis lowest, and galloped out of sight.”\n\nYou may guess how I felt at hearing this news. It struck me directly\nshe must have started for Penistone Crags. “What will become of her?” I\nejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and\nmaking straight to the high-road. I walked as if for a wager, mile\nafter mile, till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no\nCatherine could I detect, far or near. The Crags lie about a mile and a\nhalf beyond Mr. Heathcliff’s place, and that is four from the Grange,\nso I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them. “And what\nif she should have slipped in clambering among them,” I reflected, “and\nbeen killed, or broken some of her bones?” My suspense was truly\npainful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to observe, in\nhurrying by the farmhouse, Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying\nunder a window, with swelled head and bleeding ear. I opened the wicket\nand ran to the door, knocking vehemently for admittance. A woman whom I\nknew, and who formerly lived at Gimmerton, answered: she had been\nservant there since the death of Mr. Earnshaw.\n\n“Ah,” said she, “you are come a-seeking your little mistress! Don’t be\nfrightened. She’s here safe: but I’m glad it isn’t the master.”\n\n“He is not at home then, is he?” I panted, quite breathless with quick\nwalking and alarm.\n\n“No, no,” she replied: “both he and Joseph are off, and I think they\nwon’t return this hour or more. Step in and rest you a bit.”\n\nI entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking\nherself in a little chair that had been her mother’s when a child. Her\nhat was hung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home,\nlaughing and chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton—now\na great, strong lad of eighteen—who stared at her with considerable\ncuriosity and astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent\nsuccession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased\npouring forth.\n\n“Very well, Miss!” I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry\ncountenance. “This is your last ride, till papa comes back. I’ll not\ntrust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!”\n\n“Aha, Ellen!” she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side. “I\nshall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you’ve found me out.\nHave you ever been here in your life before?”\n\n“Put that hat on, and home at once,” said I. “I’m dreadfully grieved at\nyou, Miss Cathy: you’ve done extremely wrong! It’s no use pouting and\ncrying: that won’t repay the trouble I’ve had, scouring the country\nafter you. To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you\nstealing off so! It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will\nput faith in you any more.”\n\n“What have I done?” sobbed she, instantly checked. “Papa charged me\nnothing: he’ll not scold me, Ellen—he’s never cross, like you!”\n\n“Come, come!” I repeated. “I’ll tie the riband. Now, let us have no\npetulance. Oh, for shame! You thirteen years old, and such a baby!”\n\nThis exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and\nretreating to the chimney out of my reach.\n\n“Nay,” said the servant, “don’t be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean.\nWe made her stop: she’d fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be\nuneasy. Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it’s a\nwild road over the hills.”\n\nHareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets,\ntoo awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my\nintrusion.\n\n“How long am I to wait?” I continued, disregarding the woman’s\ninterference. “It will be dark in ten minutes. Where is the pony, Miss\nCathy? And where is Phoenix? I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so\nplease yourself.”\n\n“The pony is in the yard,” she replied, “and Phoenix is shut in there.\nHe’s bitten—and so is Charlie. I was going to tell you all about it;\nbut you are in a bad temper, and don’t deserve to hear.”\n\nI picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving\nthat the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering\nround the room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under\nand behind the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue.\nHareton and the woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more\nimpertinent still; till I cried, in great irritation,—“Well, Miss\nCathy, if you were aware whose house this is you’d be glad enough to\nget out.”\n\n“It’s _your_ father’s, isn’t it?” said she, turning to Hareton.\n\n“Nay,” he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.\n\nHe could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just\nhis own.\n\n“Whose then—your master’s?” she asked.\n\nHe coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and\nturned away.\n\n“Who is his master?” continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me. “He\ntalked about ‘our house,’ and ‘our folk.’ I thought he had been the\nowner’s son. And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn’t he,\nif he’s a servant?”\n\nHareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech. I\nsilently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her\nfor departure.\n\n“Now, get my horse,” she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she\nwould one of the stable-boys at the Grange. “And you may come with me.\nI want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear\nabout the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste! What’s the\nmatter? Get my horse, I say.”\n\n“I’ll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!” growled the lad.\n\n“You’ll see me _what?_” asked Catherine in surprise.\n\n“Damned—thou saucy witch!” he replied.\n\n“There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty company,” I\ninterposed. “Nice words to be used to a young lady! Pray don’t begin to\ndispute with him. Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.”\n\n“But, Ellen,” cried she, staring fixed in astonishment, “how dare he\nspeak so to me? Mustn’t he be made to do as I ask him? You wicked\ncreature, I shall tell papa what you said.—Now, then!”\n\nHareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into\nher eyes with indignation. “You bring the pony,” she exclaimed, turning\nto the woman, “and let my dog free this moment!”\n\n“Softly, Miss,” answered the addressed. “You’ll lose nothing by being\ncivil. Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master’s son, he’s your\ncousin: and I was never hired to serve you.”\n\n“_He_ my cousin!” cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.\n\n“Yes, indeed,” responded her reprover.\n\n“Oh, Ellen! don’t let them say such things,” she pursued in great\ntrouble. “Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a\ngentleman’s son. That my—” she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the\nbare notion of relationship with such a clown.\n\n“Hush, hush!” I whispered; “people can have many cousins and of all\nsorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they\nneedn’t keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.”\n\n“He’s not—he’s not my cousin, Ellen!” she went on, gathering fresh\ngrief from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge\nfrom the idea.\n\nI was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations;\nhaving no doubt of Linton’s approaching arrival, communicated by the\nformer, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that\nCatherine’s first thought on her father’s return would be to seek an\nexplanation of the latter’s assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.\nHareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant,\nseemed moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the\ndoor, he took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp\nfrom the kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he\nmeant nought. Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a\nglance of awe and horror, then burst forth anew.\n\nI could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor\nfellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features,\nand stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily\noccupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after\nrabbits and game. Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a\nmind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed. Good\nthings lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far\nover-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a\nwealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and\nfavourable circumstances. Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated\nhim physically ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no\ntemptation to that course of oppression: he had none of the timid\nsusceptibility that would have given zest to ill-treatment, in\nHeathcliff’s judgment. He appeared to have bent his malevolence on\nmaking him a brute: he was never taught to read or write; never rebuked\nfor any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never led a single\nstep towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept against vice. And\nfrom what I heard, Joseph contributed much to his deterioration, by a\nnarrow-minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him, as\na boy, because he was the head of the old family. And as he had been in\nthe habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children,\nof putting the master past his patience, and compelling him to seek\nsolace in drink by what he termed their “offald ways,” so at present he\nlaid the whole burden of Hareton’s faults on the shoulders of the\nusurper of his property. If the lad swore, he wouldn’t correct him: nor\nhowever culpably he behaved. It gave Joseph satisfaction, apparently,\nto watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed that the lad was ruined:\nthat his soul was abandoned to perdition; but then he reflected that\nHeathcliff must answer for it. Hareton’s blood would be required at his\nhands; and there lay immense consolation in that thought. Joseph had\ninstilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he would, had\nhe dared, have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the\nHeights: but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition; and he\nconfined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private\ncomminations. I don’t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode\nof living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak\nfrom hearsay; for I saw little. The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff\nwas _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants; but the house,\ninside, had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female\nmanagement, and the scenes of riot common in Hindley’s time were not\nnow enacted within its walls. The master was too gloomy to seek\ncompanionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.\n\nThis, however, is not making progress with my story. Miss Cathy\nrejected the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs,\nCharlie and Phoenix. They came limping and hanging their heads; and we\nset out for home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us. I could not\nwring from my little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I\nsupposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she\narrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse, when Hareton\nhappened to issue forth, attended by some canine followers, who\nattacked her train. They had a smart battle, before their owners could\nseparate them: that formed an introduction. Catherine told Hareton who\nshe was, and where she was going; and asked him to show her the way:\nfinally, beguiling him to accompany her. He opened the mysteries of the\nFairy Cave, and twenty other queer places. But, being in disgrace, I\nwas not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw.\nI could gather, however, that her guide had been a favourite till she\nhurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff’s\nhousekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin. Then the language he\nhad held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always “love,” and\n“darling,” and “queen,” and “angel,” with everybody at the Grange, to\nbe insulted so shockingly by a stranger! She did not comprehend it; and\nhard work I had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the\ngrievance before her father. I explained how he objected to the whole\nhousehold at the Heights, and how sorry he would be to find she had\nbeen there; but I insisted most on the fact, that if she revealed my\nnegligence of his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that I should\nhave to leave; and Cathy couldn’t bear that prospect: she pledged her\nword, and kept it for my sake. After all, she was a sweet little girl.\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nA letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master’s return.\nIsabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his\ndaughter, and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his\nyouthful nephew. Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming\nher father back; and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the\ninnumerable excellencies of her “real” cousin. The evening of their\nexpected arrival came. Since early morning she had been busy ordering\nher own small affairs; and now attired in her new black frock—poor\nthing! her aunt’s death impressed her with no definite sorrow—she\nobliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her down through the\ngrounds to meet them.\n\n“Linton is just six months younger than I am,” she chattered, as we\nstrolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under\nshadow of the trees. “How delightful it will be to have him for a\nplayfellow! Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it\nwas lighter than mine—more flaxen, and quite as fine. I have it\ncarefully preserved in a little glass box; and I’ve often thought what\na pleasure it would be to see its owner. Oh! I am happy—and papa, dear,\ndear papa! Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.”\n\nShe ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober\nfootsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy\nbank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was\nimpossible: she couldn’t be still a minute.\n\n“How long they are!” she exclaimed. “Ah, I see some dust on the\nroad—they are coming! No! When will they be here? May we not go a\nlittle way—half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile? Do say yes, to\nthat clump of birches at the turn!”\n\nI refused staunchly. At length her suspense was ended: the travelling\ncarriage rolled in sight. Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her\narms as soon as she caught her father’s face looking from the window.\nHe descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval\nelapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves. While\nthey exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton. He was\nasleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had\nbeen winter. A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been\ntaken for my master’s younger brother, so strong was the resemblance:\nbut there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton\nnever had. The latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised\nme to close the door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had\nfatigued him. Cathy would fain have taken one glance, but her father\ntold her to come, and they walked together up the park, while I\nhastened before to prepare the servants.\n\n“Now, darling,” said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they\nhalted at the bottom of the front steps: “your cousin is not so strong\nor so merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very\nshort time since; therefore, don’t expect him to play and run about\nwith you directly. And don’t harass him much by talking: let him be\nquiet this evening, at least, will you?”\n\n“Yes, yes, papa,” answered Catherine: “but I do want to see him; and he\nhasn’t once looked out.”\n\nThe carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the\nground by his uncle.\n\n“This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,” he said, putting their little\nhands together. “She’s fond of you already; and mind you don’t grieve\nher by crying to-night. Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an\nend, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you\nplease.”\n\n“Let me go to bed, then,” answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine’s\nsalute; and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears.\n\n“Come, come, there’s a good child,” I whispered, leading him in.\n“You’ll make her weep too—see how sorry she is for you!”\n\nI do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as\nsad a countenance as himself, and returned to her father. All three\nentered, and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready. I\nproceeded to remove Linton’s cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair\nby the table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.\nMy master inquired what was the matter.\n\n“I can’t sit on a chair,” sobbed the boy.\n\n“Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,” answered\nhis uncle patiently.\n\nHe had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his\nfretful ailing charge. Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down.\nCathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side. At first she sat\nsilent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her\nlittle cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking\nhis curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer,\nlike a baby. This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his\neyes, and lightened into a faint smile.\n\n“Oh, he’ll do very well,” said the master to me, after watching them a\nminute. “Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen. The company of a child\nof his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for\nstrength he’ll gain it.”\n\n“Ay, if we can keep him!” I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came\nover me that there was slight hope of that. And then, I thought, how\never will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights? Between his father\nand Hareton, what playmates and instructors they’ll be. Our doubts were\npresently decided—even earlier than I expected. I had just taken the\nchildren upstairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep—he\nwould not suffer me to leave him till that was the case—I had come\ndown, and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom\ncandle for Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and\ninformed me that Mr. Heathcliff’s servant Joseph was at the door, and\nwished to speak with the master.\n\n“I shall ask him what he wants first,” I said, in considerable\ntrepidation. “A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the\ninstant they have returned from a long journey. I don’t think the\nmaster can see him.”\n\nJoseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and\nnow presented himself in the hall. He was donned in his Sunday\ngarments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding\nhis hat in one hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean\nhis shoes on the mat.\n\n“Good-evening, Joseph,” I said, coldly. “What business brings you here\nto-night?”\n\n“It’s Maister Linton I mun spake to,” he answered, waving me\ndisdainfully aside.\n\n“Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to\nsay, I’m sure he won’t hear it now,” I continued. “You had better sit\ndown in there, and entrust your message to me.”\n\n“Which is his rahm?” pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed\ndoors.\n\nI perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I\nwent up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor,\nadvising that he should be dismissed till next day. Mr. Linton had no\ntime to empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and,\npushing into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the\ntable, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began\nin an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition—\n\n“Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn’t goa back ’bout him.”\n\nEdgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow\novercast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own\naccount; but, recalling Isabella’s hopes and fears, and anxious wishes\nfor her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved\nbitterly at the prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart\nhow it might be avoided. No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of\nany desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more\nperemptory: there was nothing left but to resign him. However, he was\nnot going to rouse him from his sleep.\n\n“Tell Mr. Heathcliff,” he answered calmly, “that his son shall come to\nWuthering Heights to-morrow. He is in bed, and too tired to go the\ndistance now. You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired\nhim to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is\nvery precarious.”\n\n“Noa!” said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and\nassuming an authoritative air. “Noa! that means naught. Hathecliff maks\nnoa ’count o’ t’ mother, nor ye norther; but he’ll hev his lad; und I\nmun tak’ him—soa now ye knaw!”\n\n“You shall not to-night!” answered Linton decisively. “Walk down stairs\nat once, and repeat to your master what I have said. Ellen, show him\ndown. Go—”\n\nAnd, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room\nof him and closed the door.\n\n“Varrah weell!” shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off. “To-morn, he’s\ncome hisseln, and thrust _him_ out, if ye darr!”\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTo obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton\ncommissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine’s pony; and,\nsaid he—“As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or\nbad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she\ncannot associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain\nin ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious\nto visit the Heights. Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly,\nand he has been obliged to leave us.”\n\nLinton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o’clock,\nand astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further\ntravelling; but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going\nto spend some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see\nhim so much, he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should\nrecover from his late journey.\n\n“My father!” he cried, in strange perplexity. “Mamma never told me I\nhad a father. Where does he live? I’d rather stay with uncle.”\n\n“He lives a little distance from the Grange,” I replied; “just beyond\nthose hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get\nhearty. And you should be glad to go home, and to see him. You must try\nto love him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.”\n\n“But why have I not heard of him before?” asked Linton. “Why didn’t\nmamma and he live together, as other people do?”\n\n“He had business to keep him in the north,” I answered, “and your\nmother’s health required her to reside in the south.”\n\n“And why didn’t mamma speak to me about him?” persevered the child.\n“She often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago. How am I\nto love papa? I don’t know him.”\n\n“Oh, all children love their parents,” I said. “Your mother, perhaps,\nthought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to\nyou. Let us make haste. An early ride on such a beautiful morning is\nmuch preferable to an hour’s more sleep.”\n\n“Is _she_ to go with us,” he demanded, “the little girl I saw\nyesterday?”\n\n“Not now,” replied I.\n\n“Is uncle?” he continued.\n\n“No, I shall be your companion there,” I said.\n\nLinton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.\n\n“I won’t go without uncle,” he cried at length: “I can’t tell where you\nmean to take me.”\n\nI attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to\nmeet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards\ndressing, and I had to call for my master’s assistance in coaxing him\nout of bed. The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive\nassurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy\nwould visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I\ninvented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way. The pure\nheather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of\nMinny, relieved his despondency after a while. He began to put\nquestions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater\ninterest and liveliness.\n\n“Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?” he\ninquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light\nmist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.\n\n“It is not so buried in trees,” I replied, “and it is not quite so\nlarge, but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air\nis healthier for you—fresher and drier. You will, perhaps, think the\nbuilding old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the\nnext best in the neighbourhood. And you will have such nice rambles on\nthe moors. Hareton Earnshaw—that is, Miss Cathy’s other cousin, and so\nyours in a manner—will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can\nbring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and,\nnow and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently,\nwalk out on the hills.”\n\n“And what is my father like?” he asked. “Is he as young and handsome as\nuncle?”\n\n“He’s as young,” said I; “but he has black hair and eyes, and looks\nsterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether. He’ll not seem to you\nso gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,\nmind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he’ll be fonder\nof you than any uncle, for you are his own.”\n\n“Black hair and eyes!” mused Linton. “I can’t fancy him. Then I am not\nlike him, am I?”\n\n“Not much,” I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret\nthe white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large\nlanguid eyes—his mother’s eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness\nkindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.\n\n“How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!” he\nmurmured. “Has he ever seen me? If he has, I must have been a baby. I\nremember not a single thing about him!”\n\n“Why, Master Linton,” said I, “three hundred miles is a great distance;\nand ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person\ncompared with what they do to you. It is probable Mr. Heathcliff\nproposed going from summer to summer, but never found a convenient\nopportunity; and now it is too late. Don’t trouble him with questions\non the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.”\n\nThe boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder\nof the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate. I watched\nto catch his impressions in his countenance. He surveyed the carved\nfront and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and\ncrooked firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his\nprivate feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.\nBut he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation\nwithin. Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door. It was\nhalf-past six; the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was\nclearing and wiping down the table. Joseph stood by his master’s chair\ntelling some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing\nfor the hayfield.\n\n“Hallo, Nelly!” said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me. “I feared I should\nhave to come down and fetch my property myself. You’ve brought it, have\nyou? Let us see what we can make of it.”\n\nHe got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping\ncuriosity. Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the\nthree.\n\n“Sure-ly,” said Joseph after a grave inspection, “he’s swopped wi’ ye,\nMaister, an’ yon’s his lass!”\n\nHeathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a\nscornful laugh.\n\n“God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!” he exclaimed.\n“Hav’n’t they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn my\nsoul! but that’s worse than I expected—and the devil knows I was not\nsanguine!”\n\nI bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter. He did\nnot thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father’s speech, or\nwhether it were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that\nthe grim, sneering stranger was his father. But he clung to me with\ngrowing trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff’s taking a seat and bidding\nhim “come hither” he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.\n\n“Tut, tut!” said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him\nroughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin.\n“None of that nonsense! We’re not going to hurt thee, Linton—isn’t that\nthy name? Thou art thy mother’s child, entirely! Where is _my_ share in\nthee, puling chicken?”\n\nHe took off the boy’s cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt\nhis slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton\nceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.\n\n“Do you know me?” asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the\nlimbs were all equally frail and feeble.\n\n“No,” said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.\n\n“You’ve heard of me, I daresay?”\n\n“No,” he replied again.\n\n“No! What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for\nme! You are my son, then, I’ll tell you; and your mother was a wicked\nslut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.\nNow, don’t wince, and colour up! Though it _is_ something to see you\nhave not white blood. Be a good lad; and I’ll do for you. Nelly, if you\nbe tired you may sit down; if not, get home again. I guess you’ll\nreport what you hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this\nthing won’t be settled while you linger about it.”\n\n“Well,” replied I, “I hope you’ll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff,\nor you’ll not keep him long; and he’s all you have akin in the wide\nworld, that you will ever know—remember.”\n\n“I’ll be _very_ kind to him, you needn’t fear,” he said, laughing.\n“Only nobody else must be kind to him: I’m jealous of monopolising his\naffection. And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some\nbreakfast. Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work. Yes, Nell,”\nhe added, when they had departed, “my son is prospective owner of your\nplace, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his\nsuccessor. Besides, he’s _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_\ndescendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children\nto till their fathers’ lands for wages. That is the sole consideration\nwhich can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate\nhim for the memories he revives! But that consideration is sufficient:\nhe’s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master\ntends his own. I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome\nstyle; I’ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from\ntwenty miles’ distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn. I’ve\nordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I’ve arranged everything with\na view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his\nassociates. I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the\ntrouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a\nworthy object of pride; and I’m bitterly disappointed with the\nwhey-faced, whining wretch!”\n\nWhile he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of\nmilk-porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the\nhomely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it.\nI saw the old man-servant shared largely in his master’s scorn of the\nchild; though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart,\nbecause Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.\n\n“Cannot ate it?” repeated he, peering in Linton’s face, and subduing\nhis voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard. “But Maister\nHareton nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little ’un; and what wer\ngooid eneugh for him’s gooid eneugh for ye, I’s rayther think!”\n\n“I _sha’n’t_ eat it!” answered Linton, snappishly. “Take it away.”\n\nJoseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.\n\n“Is there aught ails th’ victuals?” he asked, thrusting the tray under\nHeathcliff’s nose.\n\n“What should ail them?” he said.\n\n“Wah!” answered Joseph, “yon dainty chap says he cannut ate ’em. But I\nguess it’s raight! His mother wer just soa—we wer a’most too mucky to\nsow t’ corn for makking her breead.”\n\n“Don’t mention his mother to me,” said the master, angrily. “Get him\nsomething that he can eat, that’s all. What is his usual food, Nelly?”\n\nI suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received\ninstructions to prepare some. Come, I reflected, his father’s\nselfishness may contribute to his comfort. He perceives his delicate\nconstitution, and the necessity of treating him tolerably. I’ll console\nMr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff’s humour has\ntaken. Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while\nLinton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly\nsheep-dog. But he was too much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed\nthe door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the words—\n\n“Don’t leave me! I’ll not stay here! I’ll not stay here!”\n\nThen the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come\nforth. I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief\nguardianship ended.\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nWe had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee,\neager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations\nfollowed the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to\nsoothe her, by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however,\n“if I can get him”; and there were no hopes of that. This promise\npoorly pacified her; but time was more potent; and though still at\nintervals she inquired of her father when Linton would return, before\nshe did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that\nshe did not recognise him.\n\nWhen I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in\npaying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master\ngot on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was\nnever to be seen. I could gather from her that he continued in weak\nhealth, and was a tiresome inmate. She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to\ndislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to\nconceal it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could\nnot do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes\ntogether. There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his\nlessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the\nparlour: or else lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting\ncoughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of some sort.\n\n“And I never knew such a faint-hearted creature,” added the woman; “nor\none so careful of hisseln. He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open\na bit late in the evening. Oh! it’s killing, a breath of night air! And\nhe must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph’s bacca-pipe is\npoison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk,\nmilk for ever—heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter;\nand there he’ll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the\nfire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and\nif Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him—Hareton is not bad-natured,\nthough he’s rough—they’re sure to part, one swearing and the other\ncrying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw’s thrashing him to a\nmummy, if he were not his son; and I’m certain he would be fit to turn\nhim out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But\nthen he won’t go into danger of temptation: he never enters the\nparlour, and should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he\nsends him upstairs directly.”\n\nI divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered\nyoung Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so\noriginally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still\nI was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had\nbeen left with us. Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he\nthought a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk\nto see him; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever\ncame into the village? She said he had only been twice, on horseback,\naccompanying his father; and both times he pretended to be quite\nknocked up for three or four days afterwards. That housekeeper left, if\nI recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I did\nnot know, was her successor; she lives there still.\n\nTime wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy\nreached sixteen. On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested\nany signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late\nmistress’s death. Her father invariably spent that day alone in the\nlibrary; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he\nwould frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight. Therefore Catherine\nwas thrown on her own resources for amusement. This twentieth of March\nwas a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young\nlady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a\nramble on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave,\nif we went only a short distance and were back within the hour.\n\n“So make haste, Ellen!” she cried. “I know where I wish to go; where a\ncolony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made\ntheir nests yet.”\n\n“That must be a good distance up,” I answered; “they don’t breed on the\nedge of the moor.”\n\n“No, it’s not,” she said. “I’ve gone very near with papa.”\n\nI put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the\nmatter. She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off\nagain like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of\nentertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near, and\nenjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my\ndelight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright\ncheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes\nradiant with cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature, and an\nangel, in those days. It’s a pity she could not be content.\n\n“Well,” said I, “where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy? We should be at\nthem: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.”\n\n“Oh, a little further—only a little further, Ellen,” was her answer,\ncontinually. “Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time\nyou reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.”\n\nBut there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at\nlength, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our\nsteps. I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she\neither did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I\nwas compelled to follow. Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I\ncame in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights\nthan her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of\nwhom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.\n\nCathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting\nout the nests of the grouse. The Heights were Heathcliff’s land, and he\nwas reproving the poacher.\n\n“I’ve neither taken any nor found any,” she said, as I toiled to them,\nexpanding her hands in corroboration of the statement. “I didn’t mean\nto take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I\nwished to see the eggs.”\n\nHeathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his\nacquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards\nit, and demanded who “papa” was?\n\n“Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,” she replied. “I thought you did not\nknow me, or you wouldn’t have spoken in that way.”\n\n“You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?” he said,\nsarcastically.\n\n“And what are you?” inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the\nspeaker. “That man I’ve seen before. Is he your son?”\n\nShe pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing\nbut increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his\nage: he seemed as awkward and rough as ever.\n\n“Miss Cathy,” I interrupted, “it will be three hours instead of one\nthat we are out, presently. We really must go back.”\n\n“No, that man is not my son,” answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside.\n“But I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your\nnurse is in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a\nlittle rest. Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my\nhouse? You’ll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a\nkind welcome.”\n\nI whispered Catherine that she mustn’t, on any account, accede to the\nproposal: it was entirely out of the question.\n\n“Why?” she asked, aloud. “I’m tired of running, and the ground is dewy:\nI can’t sit here. Let us go, Ellen. Besides, he says I have seen his\nson. He’s mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the\nfarmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags. Don’t you?”\n\n“I do. Come, Nelly, hold your tongue—it will be a treat for her to look\nin on us. Hareton, get forwards with the lass. You shall walk with me,\nNelly.”\n\n“No, she’s not going to any such place,” I cried, struggling to release\nmy arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones\nalready, scampering round the brow at full speed. Her appointed\ncompanion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side,\nand vanished.\n\n“Mr. Heathcliff, it’s very wrong,” I continued: “you know you mean no\ngood. And there she’ll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever\nwe return; and I shall have the blame.”\n\n“I want her to see Linton,” he answered; “he’s looking better these few\ndays; it’s not often he’s fit to be seen. And we’ll soon persuade her\nto keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?”\n\n“The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I\nsuffered her to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad\ndesign in encouraging her to do so,” I replied.\n\n“My design is as honest as possible. I’ll inform you of its whole\nscope,” he said. “That the two cousins may fall in love, and get\nmarried. I’m acting generously to your master: his young chit has no\nexpectations, and should she second my wishes she’ll be provided for at\nonce as joint successor with Linton.”\n\n“If Linton died,” I answered, “and his life is quite uncertain,\nCatherine would be the heir.”\n\n“No, she would not,” he said. “There is no clause in the will to secure\nit so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire\ntheir union, and am resolved to bring it about.”\n\n“And I’m resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,” I\nreturned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming.\n\nHeathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to\nopen the door. My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could\nnot exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled\nwhen he met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I\nwas foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him\nfrom desiring her injury. Linton stood on the hearth. He had been out\nwalking in the fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph\nto bring him dry shoes. He had grown tall of his age, still wanting\nsome months of sixteen. His features were pretty yet, and his eye and\ncomplexion brighter than I remembered them, though with merely\ntemporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.\n\n“Now, who is that?” asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy. “Can you\ntell?”\n\n“Your son?” she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then\nthe other.\n\n“Yes, yes,” answered he: “but is this the only time you have beheld\nhim? Think! Ah! you have a short memory. Linton, don’t you recall your\ncousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?”\n\n“What, Linton!” cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.\n“Is that little Linton? He’s taller than I am! Are you Linton?”\n\nThe youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him\nfervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in\nthe appearance of each. Catherine had reached her full height; her\nfigure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole\naspect sparkling with health and spirits. Linton’s looks and movements\nwere very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace\nin his manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not\nunpleasing. After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his\ncousin went to Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his\nattention between the objects inside and those that lay without:\npretending, that is, to observe the latter, and really noting the\nformer alone.\n\n“And you are my uncle, then!” she cried, reaching up to salute him. “I\nthought I liked you, though you were cross at first. Why don’t you\nvisit at the Grange with Linton? To live all these years such close\nneighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?”\n\n“I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,” he\nanswered. “There—damn it! If you have any kisses to spare, give them to\nLinton: they are thrown away on me.”\n\n“Naughty Ellen!” exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her\nlavish caresses. “Wicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering. But\nI’ll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and\nsometimes bring papa. Won’t you be glad to see us?”\n\n“Of course,” replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,\nresulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors. “But\nstay,” he continued, turning towards the young lady. “Now I think of\nit, I’d better tell you. Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we\nquarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if\nyou mention coming here to him, he’ll put a veto on your visits\naltogether. Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless\nof seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you\nmust not mention it.”\n\n“Why did you quarrel?” asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.\n\n“He thought me too poor to wed his sister,” answered Heathcliff, “and\nwas grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he’ll never forgive\nit.”\n\n“That’s wrong!” said the young lady: “some time I’ll tell him so. But\nLinton and I have no share in your quarrel. I’ll not come here, then;\nhe shall come to the Grange.”\n\n“It will be too far for me,” murmured her cousin: “to walk four miles\nwould kill me. No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every\nmorning, but once or twice a week.”\n\nThe father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.\n\n“I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,” he muttered to me. “Miss\nCatherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send\nhim to the devil. Now, if it had been Hareton!—Do you know that, twenty\ntimes a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation? I’d have loved\nthe lad had he been some one else. But I think he’s safe from _her_\nlove. I’ll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir\nitself briskly. We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.\nOh, confound the vapid thing! He’s absorbed in drying his feet, and\nnever looks at her.—Linton!”\n\n“Yes, father,” answered the boy.\n\n“Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit\nor a weasel’s nest? Take her into the garden, before you change your\nshoes; and into the stable to see your horse.”\n\n“Wouldn’t you rather sit here?” asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a\ntone which expressed reluctance to move again.\n\n“I don’t know,” she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and\nevidently eager to be active.\n\nHe kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire. Heathcliff rose, and\nwent into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for\nHareton. Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered. The young\nman had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks\nand his wetted hair.\n\n“Oh, I’ll ask _you_, uncle,” cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the\nhousekeeper’s assertion. “That is not my cousin, is he?”\n\n“Yes,” he replied, “your mother’s nephew. Don’t you like him?”\n\nCatherine looked queer.\n\n“Is he not a handsome lad?” he continued.\n\nThe uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in\nHeathcliff’s ear. He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very\nsensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his\ninferiority. But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming—\n\n“You’ll be the favourite among us, Hareton! She says you are a—What was\nit? Well, something very flattering. Here! you go with her round the\nfarm. And behave like a gentleman, mind! Don’t use any bad words; and\ndon’t stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to\nhide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly,\nand keep your hands out of your pockets. Be off, and entertain her as\nnicely as you can.”\n\nHe watched the couple walking past the window. Earnshaw had his\ncountenance completely averted from his companion. He seemed studying\nthe familiar landscape with a stranger’s and an artist’s interest.\nCatherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration. She then\nturned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself,\nand tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of\nconversation.\n\n“I’ve tied his tongue,” observed Heathcliff. “He’ll not venture a\nsingle syllable all the time! Nelly, you recollect me at his age—nay,\nsome years younger. Did I ever look so stupid: so ‘gaumless,’ as Joseph\ncalls it?”\n\n“Worse,” I replied, “because more sullen with it.”\n\n“I’ve a pleasure in him,” he continued, reflecting aloud. “He has\nsatisfied my expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it\nhalf so much. But he’s no fool; and I can sympathise with all his\nfeelings, having felt them myself. I know what he suffers now, for\ninstance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer,\nthough. And he’ll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness\nand ignorance. I’ve got him faster than his scoundrel of a father\nsecured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness. I’ve\ntaught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak. Don’t\nyou think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him?\nalmost as proud as I am of mine. But there’s this difference; one is\ngold put to the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to\nape a service of silver. _Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I\nshall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go.\n_His_ had first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than\nunavailing. _I_ have nothing to regret; _he_ would have more than any,\nbut I, are aware of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of\nme! You’ll own that I’ve outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain\ncould rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring’s wrongs, I\nshould have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again,\nindignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the\nworld!”\n\nHeathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea. I made no reply,\nbecause I saw that he expected none. Meantime, our young companion, who\nsat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms\nof uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat\nof Catherine’s society for fear of a little fatigue. His father\nremarked the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand\nirresolutely extended towards his cap.\n\n“Get up, you idle boy!” he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness. “Away\nafter them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.”\n\nLinton gathered his energies, and left the hearth. The lattice was\nopen, and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable\nattendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up,\nand scratched his head like a true clown.\n\n“It’s some damnable writing,” he answered. “I cannot read it.”\n\n“Can’t read it?” cried Catherine; “I can read it: it’s English. But I\nwant to know why it is there.”\n\nLinton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.\n\n“He does not know his letters,” he said to his cousin. “Could you\nbelieve in the existence of such a colossal dunce?”\n\n“Is he all as he should be?” asked Miss Cathy, seriously; “or is he\nsimple: not right? I’ve questioned him twice now, and each time he\nlooked so stupid I think he does not understand me. I can hardly\nunderstand _him_, I’m sure!”\n\nLinton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who\ncertainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.\n\n“There’s nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?” he said.\n“My cousin fancies you are an idiot. There you experience the\nconsequence of scorning ‘book-larning,’ as you would say. Have you\nnoticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?”\n\n“Why, where the devil is the use on’t?” growled Hareton, more ready in\nanswering his daily companion. He was about to enlarge further, but the\ntwo youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being\ndelighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of\namusement.\n\n“Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?” tittered Linton.\n“Papa told you not to say any bad words, and you can’t open your mouth\nwithout one. Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!”\n\n“If thou weren’t more a lass than a lad, I’d fell thee this minute, I\nwould; pitiful lath of a crater!” retorted the angry boor, retreating,\nwhile his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification; for he was\nconscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.\n\nMr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled\nwhen he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular\naversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the doorway:\nthe boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton’s faults and\ndeficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl\nrelishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the\nill-nature they evinced. I began to dislike, more than to compassionate\nLinton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.\n\nWe stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but\nhappily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant\nof our prolonged absence. As we walked home, I would fain have\nenlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted:\nbut she got it into her head that I was prejudiced against them.\n\n“Aha!” she cried, “you take papa’s side, Ellen: you are partial I know;\nor else you wouldn’t have cheated me so many years into the notion that\nLinton lived a long way from here. I’m really extremely angry; only I’m\nso pleased I can’t show it! But you must hold your tongue about my\nuncle; he’s _my_ uncle, remember; and I’ll scold papa for quarrelling\nwith him.”\n\nAnd so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of\nher mistake. She did not mention the visit that night, because she did\nnot see Mr. Linton. Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and\nstill I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and\nwarning would be more efficiently borne by him than me. But he was too\ntimid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun\nconnection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good\nreasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.\n\n“Papa!” she exclaimed, after the morning’s salutations, “guess whom I\nsaw yesterday, in my walk on the moors. Ah, papa, you started! you’ve\nnot done right, have you, now? I saw—but listen, and you shall hear how\nI found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet\npretended to pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always\ndisappointed about Linton’s coming back!”\n\nShe gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and\nmy master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said\nnothing till she had concluded. Then he drew her to him, and asked if\nshe knew why he had concealed Linton’s near neighbourhood from her?\nCould she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly\nenjoy?\n\n“It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,” she answered.\n\n“Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?”\nhe said. “No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because\nMr. Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to\nwrong and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest\nopportunity. I knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with\nyour cousin without being brought into contact with him; and I knew he\nwould detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing else,\nI took precautions that you should not see Linton again. I meant to\nexplain this some time as you grew older, and I’m sorry I delayed it.”\n\n“But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,” observed Catherine, not\nat all convinced; “and _he_ didn’t object to our seeing each other: he\nsaid I might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell\nyou, because you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for\nmarrying aunt Isabella. And you won’t. _You_ are the one to be blamed:\nhe is willing to let _us_ be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you\nare not.”\n\nMy master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her\nuncle-in-law’s evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to\nIsabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his\nproperty. He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for\nthough he spoke little of it, he still felt the same horror and\ndetestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since\nMrs. Linton’s death. “She might have been living yet, if it had not\nbeen for him!” was his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes,\nHeathcliff seemed a murderer. Miss Cathy—conversant with no bad deeds\nexcept her own slight acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion,\narising from hot temper and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day\nthey were committed—was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could\nbrood on and cover revenge for years, and deliberately prosecute its\nplans without a visitation of remorse. She appeared so deeply impressed\nand shocked at this new view of human nature—excluded from all her\nstudies and all her ideas till now—that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary\nto pursue the subject. He merely added: “You will know hereafter,\ndarling, why I wish you to avoid his house and family; now return to\nyour old employments and amusements, and think no more about them.”\n\nCatherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a\ncouple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the\ngrounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when\nshe had retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found\nher crying, on her knees by the bedside.\n\n“Oh, fie, silly child!” I exclaimed. “If you had any real griefs you’d\nbe ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety. You never had\none shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine. Suppose, for a\nminute, that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the\nworld: how would you feel, then? Compare the present occasion with such\nan affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have,\ninstead of coveting more.”\n\n“I’m not crying for myself, Ellen,” she answered, “it’s for him. He\nexpected to see me again to-morrow, and there he’ll be so disappointed:\nand he’ll wait for me, and I sha’n’t come!”\n\n“Nonsense!” said I, “do you imagine he has thought as much of you as\nyou have of him? Hasn’t he Hareton for a companion? Not one in a\nhundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for\ntwo afternoons. Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself\nno further about you.”\n\n“But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?” she asked,\nrising to her feet. “And just send those books I promised to lend him?\nHis books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them\nextremely, when I told him how interesting they were. May I not,\nEllen?”\n\n“No, indeed! no, indeed!” replied I with decision. “Then he would write\nto you, and there’d never be an end of it. No, Miss Catherine, the\nacquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see\nthat it is done.”\n\n“But how can one little note—?” she recommenced, putting on an\nimploring countenance.\n\n“Silence!” I interrupted. “We’ll not begin with your little notes. Get\ninto bed.”\n\nShe threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss\nher good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great\ndispleasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there\nwas Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and\na pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my\nentrance.\n\n“You’ll get nobody to take that, Catherine,” I said, “if you write it;\nand at present I shall put out your candle.”\n\nI set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my\nhand and a petulant “cross thing!” I then quitted her again, and she\ndrew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours. The letter was\nfinished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came\nfrom the village; but that I didn’t learn till some time afterwards.\nWeeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew\nwondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself; and often, if I\ncame near her suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the\nbook, evidently desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose\npaper sticking out beyond the leaves. She also got a trick of coming\ndown early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she\nwere expecting the arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in\na cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, and\nwhose key she took special care to remove when she left it.\n\nOne day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings\nand trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into\nbits of folded paper. My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I\ndetermined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as\nsoon as she and my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily\nfound among my house keys one that would fit the lock. Having opened, I\nemptied the whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to\nexamine at leisure in my own chamber. Though I could not but suspect, I\nwas still surprised to discover that they were a mass of\ncorrespondence—daily almost, it must have been—from Linton Heathcliff:\nanswers to documents forwarded by her. The earlier dated were\nembarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious\nlove-letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet\nwith touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more\nexperienced source. Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds\nof ardour and flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in\nthe affected, wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied,\nincorporeal sweetheart. Whether they satisfied Cathy I don’t know; but\nthey appeared very worthless trash to me. After turning over as many as\nI thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside,\nrelocking the vacant drawer.\n\nFollowing her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the\nkitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain\nlittle boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked\nsomething into his jacket pocket, and plucked something out. I went\nround by the garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought\nvalorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I\nsucceeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious\nconsequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall\nand perused Miss Cathy’s affectionate composition. It was more simple\nand more eloquent than her cousin’s: very pretty and very silly. I\nshook my head, and went meditating into the house. The day being wet,\nshe could not divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the\nconclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the\ndrawer. Her father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had\nsought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window-curtain,\nkeeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings. Never did any bird\nflying back to a plundered nest, which it had left brimful of chirping\nyoung ones, express more complete despair, in its anguished cries and\nflutterings, than she by her single “Oh!” and the change that\ntransfigured her late happy countenance. Mr. Linton looked up.\n\n“What is the matter, love? Have you hurt yourself?” he said.\n\nHis tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the\nhoard.\n\n“No, papa!” she gasped. “Ellen! Ellen! come upstairs—I’m sick!”\n\nI obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.\n\n“Oh, Ellen! you have got them,” she commenced immediately, dropping on\nher knees, when we were enclosed alone. “Oh, give them to me, and I’ll\nnever, never do so again! Don’t tell papa. You have not told papa,\nEllen? say you have not? I’ve been exceedingly naughty, but I won’t do\nit any more!”\n\nWith a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.\n\n“So,” I exclaimed, “Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems:\nyou may well be ashamed of them! A fine bundle of trash you study in\nyour leisure hours, to be sure: why, it’s good enough to be printed!\nAnd what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before\nhim? I hav’n’t shown it yet, but you needn’t imagine I shall keep your\nridiculous secrets. For shame! and you must have led the way in writing\nsuch absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I’m certain.”\n\n“I didn’t! I didn’t!” sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart. “I didn’t\nonce think of loving him till—”\n\n“_Loving_!” cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word.\n“_Loving_! Did anybody ever hear the like! I might just as well talk of\nloving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn. Pretty loving,\nindeed! and both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours\nin your life! Now here is the babyish trash. I’m going with it to the\nlibrary; and we’ll see what your father says to such _loving_.”\n\nShe sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and\nthen she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn\nthem—do anything rather than show them. And being really fully as much\ninclined to laugh as scold—for I esteemed it all girlish vanity—I at\nlength relented in a measure, and asked,—“If I consent to burn them,\nwill you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again,\nnor a book (for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair,\nnor rings, nor playthings?”\n\n“We don’t send playthings,” cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her\nshame.\n\n“Nor anything at all, then, my lady?” I said. “Unless you will, here I\ngo.”\n\n“I promise, Ellen!” she cried, catching my dress. “Oh, put them in the\nfire, do, do!”\n\nBut when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was\ntoo painful to be borne. She earnestly supplicated that I would spare\nher one or two.\n\n“One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton’s sake!”\n\nI unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an\nangle, and the flame curled up the chimney.\n\n“I will have one, you cruel wretch!” she screamed, darting her hand\ninto the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the\nexpense of her fingers.\n\n“Very well—and I will have some to exhibit to papa!” I answered,\nshaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.\n\nShe emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to\nfinish the immolation. It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and\ninterred them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a\nsense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment. I descended\nto tell my master that the young lady’s qualm of sickness was almost\ngone, but I judged it best for her to lie down a while. She wouldn’t\ndine; but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and\nmarvellously subdued in outward aspect. Next morning I answered the\nletter by a slip of paper, inscribed, “Master Heathcliff is requested\nto send no more notes to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.”\nAnd, thenceforth, the little boy came with vacant pockets.\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nSummer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but\nthe harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still\nuncleared. Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among\nthe reapers; at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk,\nand the evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad\ncold, that settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors\nthroughout the whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.\n\nPoor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably\nsadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her\nreading less, and taking more exercise. She had his companionship no\nlonger; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible,\nwith mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or\nthree hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her\nfootsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable than his.\n\nOn an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November—a fresh watery\nafternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered\nleaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds—dark grey\nstreamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain—I\nrequested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of\nshowers. She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my\numbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a\nformal walk which she generally affected if low-spirited—and that she\ninvariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing\nnever known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from\nhis increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance. She went\nsadly on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind\nmight well have tempted her to race. And often, from the side of my\neye, I could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her\ncheek. I gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts. On one side\nof the road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks,\nwith their roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too\nloose for the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly\nhorizontal. In summer Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these\ntrunks, and sit in the branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground;\nand I, pleased with her agility and her light, childish heart, still\nconsidered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an\nelevation, but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending.\nFrom dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing\nnothing except singing old songs—my nursery lore—to herself, or\nwatching the birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones to\nfly: or nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming,\nhappier than words can express.\n\n“Look, Miss!” I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one\ntwisted tree. “Winter is not here yet. There’s a little flower up\nyonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those\nturf steps in July with a lilac mist. Will you clamber up, and pluck it\nto show to papa?”\n\nCathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy\nshelter, and replied, at length—“No, I’ll not touch it: but it looks\nmelancholy, does it not, Ellen?”\n\n“Yes,” I observed, “about as starved and sackless as you: your cheeks\nare bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run. You’re so low, I\ndaresay I shall keep up with you.”\n\n“No,” she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals\nto muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus\nspreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever\nand anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face.\n\n“Catherine, why are you crying, love?” I asked, approaching and putting\nmy arm over her shoulder. “You mustn’t cry because papa has a cold; be\nthankful it is nothing worse.”\n\nShe now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled\nby sobs.\n\n“Oh, it _will_ be something worse,” she said. “And what shall I do when\npapa and you leave me, and I am by myself? I can’t forget your words,\nEllen; they are always in my ear. How life will be changed, how dreary\nthe world will be, when papa and you are dead.”\n\n“None can tell whether you won’t die before us,” I replied. “It’s wrong\nto anticipate evil. We’ll hope there are years and years to come before\nany of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five.\nMy mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last. And suppose Mr.\nLinton were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you\nhave counted, Miss. And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity\nabove twenty years beforehand?”\n\n“But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,” she remarked, gazing up with\ntimid hope to seek further consolation.\n\n“Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,” I replied. “She wasn’t\nas happy as Master: she hadn’t as much to live for. All you need do, is\nto wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you\ncheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that,\nCathy! I’ll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and\nreckless, and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a\nperson who would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to\ndiscover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it\nexpedient to make.”\n\n“I fret about nothing on earth except papa’s illness,” answered my\ncompanion. “I care for nothing in comparison with papa. And I’ll\nnever—never—oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word\nto vex him. I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by\nthis: I pray every night that I may live after him; because I would\nrather be miserable than that he should be: that proves I love him\nbetter than myself.”\n\n“Good words,” I replied. “But deeds must prove it also; and after he is\nwell, remember you don’t forget resolutions formed in the hour of\nfear.”\n\nAs we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young\nlady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on\nthe top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed\nscarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the\nhighway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could\ntouch the upper, except from Cathy’s present station. In stretching to\npull them, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed\nscrambling down to recover it. I bid her be cautious lest she got a\nfall, and she nimbly disappeared. But the return was no such easy\nmatter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rosebushes\nand blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending.\nI, like a fool, didn’t recollect that, till I heard her laughing and\nexclaiming—“Ellen! you’ll have to fetch the key, or else I must run\nround to the porter’s lodge. I can’t scale the ramparts on this side!”\n\n“Stay where you are,” I answered; “I have my bundle of keys in my\npocket: perhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I’ll go.”\n\nCatherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while\nI tried all the large keys in succession. I had applied the last, and\nfound that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain\nthere, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an\napproaching sound arrested me. It was the trot of a horse; Cathy’s\ndance stopped also.\n\n“Who is that?” I whispered.\n\n“Ellen, I wish you could open the door,” whispered back my companion,\nanxiously.\n\n“Ho, Miss Linton!” cried a deep voice (the rider’s), “I’m glad to meet\nyou. Don’t be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and\nobtain.”\n\n“I sha’n’t speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,” answered Catherine. “Papa\nsays you are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says\nthe same.”\n\n“That is nothing to the purpose,” said Heathcliff. (He it was.) “I\ndon’t hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand\nyour attention. Yes; you have cause to blush. Two or three months\nsince, were you not in the habit of writing to Linton? making love in\nplay, eh? You deserved, both of you, flogging for that! You especially,\nthe elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out. I’ve got your letters,\nand if you give me any pertness I’ll send them to your father. I\npresume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn’t you?\nWell, you dropped Linton with it into a Slough of Despond. He was in\nearnest: in love, really. As true as I live, he’s dying for you;\nbreaking his heart at your fickleness: not figuratively, but actually.\nThough Hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks, and I have\nused more serious measures, and attempted to frighten him out of his\nidiocy, he gets worse daily; and he’ll be under the sod before summer,\nunless you restore him!”\n\n“How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?” I called from the\ninside. “Pray ride on! How can you deliberately get up such paltry\nfalsehoods? Miss Cathy, I’ll knock the lock off with a stone: you won’t\nbelieve that vile nonsense. You can feel in yourself it is impossible\nthat a person should die for love of a stranger.”\n\n“I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,” muttered the detected\nvillain. “Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don’t like your\ndouble-dealing,” he added aloud. “How could _you_ lie so glaringly as\nto affirm I hated the ‘poor child’? and invent bugbear stories to\nterrify her from my door-stones? Catherine Linton (the very name warms\nme), my bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if I\nhave not spoken truth: do, there’s a darling! Just imagine your father\nin my place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your\ncareless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your\nfather himself entreated him; and don’t, from pure stupidity, fall into\nthe same error. I swear, on my salvation, he’s going to his grave, and\nnone but you can save him!”\n\nThe lock gave way and I issued out.\n\n“I swear Linton is dying,” repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me.\n“And grief and disappointment are hastening his death. Nelly, if you\nwon’t let her go, you can walk over yourself. But I shall not return\ntill this time next week; and I think your master himself would\nscarcely object to her visiting her cousin.”\n\n“Come in,” said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to\nre-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of\nthe speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit.\n\nHe pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed—\n\n“Miss Catherine, I’ll own to you that I have little patience with\nLinton; and Hareton and Joseph have less. I’ll own that he’s with a\nharsh set. He pines for kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from\nyou would be his best medicine. Don’t mind Mrs. Dean’s cruel cautions;\nbut be generous, and contrive to see him. He dreams of you day and\nnight, and cannot be persuaded that you don’t hate him, since you\nneither write nor call.”\n\nI closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in\nholding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for\nthe rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and\nwarned us to avoid delay. Our hurry prevented any comment on the\nencounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined\ninstinctively that Catherine’s heart was clouded now in double\ndarkness. Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she\nevidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true.\n\nThe master had retired to rest before we came in. Cathy stole to his\nroom to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep. She returned, and\nasked me to sit with her in the library. We took our tea together; and\nafterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she\nwas weary. I got a book, and pretended to read. As soon as she supposed\nme absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it\nappeared, at present, her favourite diversion. I suffered her to enjoy\nit a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr.\nHeathcliff’s assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would\ncoincide. Alas! I hadn’t skill to counteract the effect his account had\nproduced: it was just what he intended.\n\n“You may be right, Ellen,” she answered; “but I shall never feel at\nease till I know. And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I\ndon’t write, and convince him that I shall not change.”\n\nWhat use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity? We\nparted that night—hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to\nWuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress’s pony. I\ncouldn’t bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected\ncountenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that\nLinton himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the\ntale was founded on fact.\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nThe rainy night had ushered in a misty morning—half frost, half\ndrizzle—and temporary brooks crossed our path—gurgling from the\nuplands. My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly\nthe humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things. We\nentered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr.\nHeathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his own\naffirmation.\n\nJoseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring\nfire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces\nof toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth. Catherine\nran to the hearth to warm herself. I asked if the master was in? My\nquestion remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had\ngrown deaf, and repeated it louder.\n\n“Na—ay!” he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose. “Na—ay! yah\nmuh goa back whear yah coom frough.”\n\n“Joseph!” cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner\nroom. “How often am I to call you? There are only a few red ashes now.\nJoseph! come this moment.”\n\nVigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no\near for this appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one\ngone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably. We knew\nLinton’s tones, and entered.\n\n“Oh, I hope you’ll die in a garret, starved to death!” said the boy,\nmistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.\n\nHe stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.\n\n“Is that you, Miss Linton?” he said, raising his head from the arm of\nthe great chair, in which he reclined. “No—don’t kiss me: it takes my\nbreath. Dear me! Papa said you would call,” continued he, after\nrecovering a little from Catherine’s embrace; while she stood by\nlooking very contrite. “Will you shut the door, if you please? you left\nit open; and those—those _detestable_ creatures won’t bring coals to\nthe fire. It’s so cold!”\n\nI stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself. The invalid\ncomplained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough,\nand looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper.\n\n“Well, Linton,” murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed,\n“are you glad to see me? Can I do you any good?”\n\n“Why didn’t you come before?” he asked. “You should have come, instead\nof writing. It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters. I’d far\nrather have talked to you. Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor\nanything else. I wonder where Zillah is! Will you” (looking at me)\n“step into the kitchen and see?”\n\nI had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to\nrun to and fro at his behest, I replied—\n\n“Nobody is out there but Joseph.”\n\n“I want to drink,” he exclaimed fretfully, turning away. “Zillah is\nconstantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it’s miserable!\nAnd I’m obliged to come down here—they resolved never to hear me\nupstairs.”\n\n“Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?” I asked,\nperceiving Catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.\n\n“Attentive? He makes _them_ a little more attentive at least,” he\ncried. “The wretches! Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton\nlaughs at me! I hate him! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious\nbeings.”\n\nCathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the\ndresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it. He bid her add a spoonful of\nwine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion,\nappeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.\n\n“And are you glad to see me?” asked she, reiterating her former\nquestion, and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.\n\n“Yes, I am. It’s something new to hear a voice like yours!” he replied.\n“But I have been vexed, because you wouldn’t come. And papa swore it\nwas owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing;\nand said you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be\nmore the master of the Grange than your father by this time. But you\ndon’t despise me, do you, Miss—?”\n\n“I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,” interrupted my young lady.\n“Despise you? No! Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than\nanybody living. I don’t love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not\ncome when he returns: will he stay away many days?”\n\n“Not many,” answered Linton; “but he goes on to the moors frequently,\nsince the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two\nwith me in his absence. Do say you will. I think I should not be\npeevish with you: you’d not provoke me, and you’d always be ready to\nhelp me, wouldn’t you?”\n\n“Yes,” said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair, “if I could only\nget papa’s consent, I’d spend half my time with you. Pretty Linton! I\nwish you were my brother.”\n\n“And then you would like me as well as your father?” observed he, more\ncheerfully. “But papa says you would love me better than him and all\nthe world, if you were my wife; so I’d rather you were that.”\n\n“No, I should never love anybody better than papa,” she returned\ngravely. “And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters\nand brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and\npapa would be as fond of you as he is of me.”\n\nLinton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed\nthey did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father’s aversion to\nher aunt. I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue. I couldn’t\nsucceed till everything she knew was out. Master Heathcliff, much\nirritated, asserted her relation was false.\n\n“Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,” she answered pertly.\n\n“_My_ papa scorns yours!” cried Linton. “He calls him a sneaking fool.”\n\n“Yours is a wicked man,” retorted Catherine; “and you are very naughty\nto dare to repeat what he says. He must be wicked to have made Aunt\nIsabella leave him as she did.”\n\n“She didn’t leave him,” said the boy; “you sha’n’t contradict me.”\n\n“She did,” cried my young lady.\n\n“Well, I’ll tell _you_ something!” said Linton. “Your mother hated your\nfather: now then.”\n\n“Oh!” exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.\n\n“And she loved mine,” added he.\n\n“You little liar! I hate you now!” she panted, and her face grew red\nwith passion.\n\n“She did! she did!” sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair,\nand leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other\ndisputant, who stood behind.\n\n“Hush, Master Heathcliff!” I said; “that’s your father’s tale, too, I\nsuppose.”\n\n“It isn’t: you hold your tongue!” he answered. “She did, she did,\nCatherine! she did, she did!”\n\nCathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to\nfall against one arm. He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough\nthat soon ended his triumph. It lasted so long that it frightened even\nme. As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the\nmischief she had done: though she said nothing. I held him till the fit\nexhausted itself. Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down\nsilently. Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat\nopposite, and looked solemnly into the fire.\n\n“How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?” I inquired, after waiting ten\nminutes.\n\n“I wish _she_ felt as I do,” he replied: “spiteful, cruel thing!\nHareton never touches me: he never struck me in his life. And I was\nbetter to-day: and there—” his voice died in a whimper.\n\n“_I_ didn’t strike you!” muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent\nanother burst of emotion.\n\nHe sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for\na quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for\nwhenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and\npathos into the inflexions of his voice.\n\n“I’m sorry I hurt you, Linton,” she said at length, racked beyond\nendurance. “But _I_ couldn’t have been hurt by that little push, and I\nhad no idea that you could, either: you’re not much, are you, Linton?\nDon’t let me go home thinking I’ve done you harm. Answer! speak to me.”\n\n“I can’t speak to you,” he murmured; “you’ve hurt me so that I shall\nlie awake all night choking with this cough. If you had it you’d know\nwhat it was; but _you’ll_ be comfortably asleep while I’m in agony, and\nnobody near me. I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful\nnights!” And he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.\n\n“Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,” I said, “it\nwon’t be Miss who spoils your ease: you’d be the same had she never\ncome. However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you’ll get\nquieter when we leave you.”\n\n“Must I go?” asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him. “Do you want\nme to go, Linton?”\n\n“You can’t alter what you’ve done,” he replied pettishly, shrinking\nfrom her, “unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a\nfever.”\n\n“Well, then, I must go?” she repeated.\n\n“Let me alone, at least,” said he; “I can’t bear your talking.”\n\nShe lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome\nwhile; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a\nmovement to the door, and I followed. We were recalled by a scream.\nLinton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing\nin the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined\nto be as grievous and harassing as it can. I thoroughly gauged his\ndisposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to\nattempt humouring him. Not so my companion: she ran back in terror,\nknelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet\nfrom lack of breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.\n\n“I shall lift him on to the settle,” I said, “and he may roll about as\nhe pleases: we can’t stop to watch him. I hope you are satisfied, Miss\nCathy, that _you_ are not the person to benefit him; and that his\ncondition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you. Now, then,\nthere he is! Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care\nfor his nonsense, he’ll be glad to lie still.”\n\nShe placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he\nrejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a\nstone or a block of wood. She tried to put it more comfortably.\n\n“I can’t do with that,” he said; “it’s not high enough.”\n\nCatherine brought another to lay above it.\n\n“That’s _too_ high,” murmured the provoking thing.\n\n“How must I arrange it, then?” she asked despairingly.\n\nHe twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and\nconverted her shoulder into a support.\n\n“No, that won’t do,” I said. “You’ll be content with the cushion,\nMaster Heathcliff. Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we\ncannot remain five minutes longer.”\n\n“Yes, yes, we can!” replied Cathy. “He’s good and patient now. He’s\nbeginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will\nto-night, if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare\nnot come again. Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I mustn’t come, if\nI have hurt you.”\n\n“You must come, to cure me,” he answered. “You ought to come, because\nyou have hurt me: you know you have extremely! I was not as ill when\nyou entered as I am at present—was I?”\n\n“But you’ve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.—I\ndidn’t do it all,” said his cousin. “However, we’ll be friends now. And\nyou want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?”\n\n“I told you I did,” he replied impatiently. “Sit on the settle and let\nme lean on your knee. That’s as mamma used to do, whole afternoons\ntogether. Sit quite still and don’t talk: but you may sing a song, if\nyou can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad—one of\nthose you promised to teach me; or a story. I’d rather have a ballad,\nthough: begin.”\n\nCatherine repeated the longest she could remember. The employment\npleased both mightily. Linton would have another, and after that\nanother, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on\nuntil the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court,\nreturning for his dinner.\n\n“And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?” asked young\nHeathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.\n\n“No,” I answered, “nor next day neither.” She, however, gave a\ndifferent response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped\nand whispered in his ear.\n\n“You won’t go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!” I commenced, when we were\nout of the house. “You are not dreaming of it, are you?”\n\nShe smiled.\n\n“Oh, I’ll take good care,” I continued: “I’ll have that lock mended,\nand you can escape by no way else.”\n\n“I can get over the wall,” she said laughing. “The Grange is not a\nprison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler. And besides, I’m almost\nseventeen: I’m a woman. And I’m certain Linton would recover quickly if\nhe had me to look after him. I’m older than he is, you know, and wiser:\nless childish, am I not? And he’ll soon do as I direct him, with some\nslight coaxing. He’s a pretty little darling when he’s good. I’d make\nsuch a pet of him, if he were mine. We should never quarrel, should we,\nafter we were used to each other? Don’t you like him, Ellen?”\n\n“Like him!” I exclaimed. “The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that\never struggled into its teens. Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured,\nhe’ll not win twenty. I doubt whether he’ll see spring, indeed. And\nsmall loss to his family whenever he drops off. And lucky it is for us\nthat his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious\nand selfish he’d be. I’m glad you have no chance of having him for a\nhusband, Miss Catherine.”\n\nMy companion waxed serious at hearing this speech. To speak of his\ndeath so regardlessly wounded her feelings.\n\n“He’s younger than I,” she answered, after a protracted pause of\nmeditation, “and he ought to live the longest: he will—he must live as\nlong as I do. He’s as strong now as when he first came into the north;\nI’m positive of that. It’s only a cold that ails him, the same as papa\nhas. You say papa will get better, and why shouldn’t he?”\n\n“Well, well,” I cried, “after all, we needn’t trouble ourselves; for\nlisten, Miss,—and mind, I’ll keep my word,—if you attempt going to\nWuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton,\nand, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be\nrevived.”\n\n“It has been revived,” muttered Cathy, sulkily.\n\n“Must not be continued, then,” I said.\n\n“We’ll see,” was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to\ntoil in the rear.\n\nWe both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had\nbeen wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no\nexplanation of our absence. As soon as I entered I hastened to change\nmy soaked shoes and stockings; but sitting such a while at the Heights\nhad done the mischief. On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and\nduring three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties:\na calamity never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am\nthankful to say, since.\n\nMy little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and\ncheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low. It is\nwearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for\ncomplaint than I had. The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton’s room she\nappeared at my bedside. Her day was divided between us; no amusement\nusurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play;\nand she was the fondest nurse that ever watched. She must have had a\nwarm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me. I said\nher days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I\ngenerally needed nothing after six o’clock, thus the evening was her\nown. Poor thing! I never considered what she did with herself after\ntea. And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I\nremarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender\nfingers, instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across\nthe moors, I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nAt the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move\nabout the house. And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the\nevening I asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak. We\nwere in the library, the master having gone to bed: she consented,\nrather unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not\nsuit her, I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused.\nShe selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about\nan hour; then came frequent questions.\n\n“Ellen, are not you tired? Hadn’t you better lie down now? You’ll be\nsick, keeping up so long, Ellen.”\n\n“No, no, dear, I’m not tired,” I returned, continually.\n\nPerceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her\ndisrelish for her occupation. It changed to yawning, and stretching,\nand—\n\n“Ellen, I’m tired.”\n\n“Give over then and talk,” I answered.\n\nThat was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till\neight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep;\njudging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she\ninflicted on her eyes. The following night she seemed more impatient\nstill; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a\nheadache, and left me. I thought her conduct odd; and having remained\nalone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were\nbetter, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of upstairs\nin the dark. No Catherine could I discover upstairs, and none below.\nThe servants affirmed they had not seen her. I listened at Mr. Edgar’s\ndoor; all was silence. I returned to her apartment, extinguished my\ncandle, and seated myself in the window.\n\nThe moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I\nreflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk\nabout the garden, for refreshment. I did detect a figure creeping along\nthe inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its\nemerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms. He stood a\nconsiderable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds;\nthen started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and\nreappeared presently, leading Miss’s pony; and there she was, just\ndismounted, and walking by its side. The man took his charge stealthily\nacross the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered by the\ncasement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where\nI awaited her. She put the door gently to, slipped off her snowy\nshoes, untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage,\nto lay aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself. The\nsurprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate\nexclamation, and stood fixed.\n\n“My dear Miss Catherine,” I began, too vividly impressed by her recent\nkindness to break into a scold, “where have you been riding out at this\nhour? And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale? Where\nhave you been? Speak!”\n\n“To the bottom of the park,” she stammered. “I didn’t tell a tale.”\n\n“And nowhere else?” I demanded.\n\n“No,” was the muttered reply.\n\n“Oh, Catherine!” I cried, sorrowfully. “You know you have been doing\nwrong, or you wouldn’t be driven to uttering an untruth to me. That\ndoes grieve me. I’d rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a\ndeliberate lie.”\n\nShe sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my\nneck.\n\n“Well, Ellen, I’m so afraid of you being angry,” she said. “Promise not\nto be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.”\n\nWe sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold,\nwhatever her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she\ncommenced—\n\n“I’ve been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I’ve never missed going a\nday since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left\nyour room. I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every\nevening, and to put her back in the stable: you mustn’t scold _him_\neither, mind. I was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally\nstayed till half-past eight, and then galloped home. It was not to\namuse myself that I went: I was often wretched all the time. Now and\nthen I was happy: once in a week perhaps. At first, I expected there\nwould be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton: for\nI had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you\nstayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble. While Michael\nwas refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got\npossession of the key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit\nhim, because he was sick, and couldn’t come to the Grange; and how papa\nwould object to my going: and then I negotiated with him about the\npony. He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get\nmarried; so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library,\nto do what I wished: but I preferred giving him my own, and that\nsatisfied him better.\n\n“On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that\nis their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us\nthat, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was\noff with his dogs—robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard\nafterwards—we might do what we liked. She brought me some warm wine and\ngingerbread, and appeared exceedingly good-natured; and Linton sat in\nthe arm-chair, and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone,\nand we laughed and talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we\nplanned where we would go, and what we would do in summer. I needn’t\nrepeat that, because you would call it silly.\n\n“One time, however, we were near quarrelling. He said the pleasantest\nmanner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening\non a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming\ndreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead,\nand the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. That\nwas his most perfect idea of heaven’s happiness: mine was rocking in a\nrustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds\nflitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and\nblackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side,\nand the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but\nclose by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze;\nand woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with\njoy. He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to\nsparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be\nonly half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall\nasleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to\ngrow very snappish. At last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the\nright weather came; and then we kissed each other and were friends.\n\n“After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its\nsmooth uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in,\nif we removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help\nus, and we’d have a game at blindman’s-buff; she should try to catch\nus: you used to, you know, Ellen. He wouldn’t: there was no pleasure in\nit, he said; but he consented to play at ball with me. We found two in\na cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores\nand shuttlecocks. One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have\nthe C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for\nHeathcliff, his name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn’t\nlike it. I beat him constantly; and he got cross again, and coughed,\nand returned to his chair. That night, though, he easily recovered his\ngood humour: he was charmed with two or three pretty songs—_your_\nsongs, Ellen; and when I was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me\nto come the following evening; and I promised. Minny and I went flying\nhome as light as air; and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet,\ndarling cousin, till morning.\n\n“On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly\nthat I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was\nbeautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared. I\nshall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what\ndelights me more, my pretty Linton will. I trotted up their garden, and\nwas turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took\nmy bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance. He patted Minny’s\nneck, and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me\nto speak to him. I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it\nwould kick him. He answered in his vulgar accent, ‘It wouldn’t do mitch\nhurt if it did;’ and surveyed its legs with a smile. I was half\ninclined to make it try; however, he moved off to open the door, and,\nas he raised the latch, he looked up to the inscription above, and\nsaid, with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation: ‘Miss\nCatherine! I can read yon, now.’\n\n“‘Wonderful,’ I exclaimed. ‘Pray let us hear you—you _are_ grown\nclever!’\n\n“He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name—‘Hareton Earnshaw.’\n\n“‘And the figures?’ I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to\na dead halt.\n\n“‘I cannot tell them yet,’ he answered.\n\n“‘Oh, you dunce!’ I said, laughing heartily at his failure.\n\n“The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl\ngathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in\nmy mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really\nwas, contempt. I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity\nand desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him. He\nreddened—I saw that by the moonlight—dropped his hand from the latch,\nand skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity. He imagined himself to\nbe as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own\nname; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn’t think the same.”\n\n“Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!” I interrupted. “I shall not scold, but I\ndon’t like your conduct there. If you had remembered that Hareton was\nyour cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how\nimproper it was to behave in that way. At least, it was praiseworthy\nambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and\nprobably he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed\nof his ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it\nand please you. To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad\nbreeding. Had _you_ been brought up in his circumstances, would you be\nless rude? He was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were;\nand I’m hurt that he should be despised now, because that base\nHeathcliff has treated him so unjustly.”\n\n“Well, Ellen, you won’t cry about it, will you?” she exclaimed,\nsurprised at my earnestness. “But wait, and you shall hear if he conned\nhis A B C to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the\nbrute. I entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to\nwelcome me.\n\n“‘I’m ill to-night, Catherine, love,’ he said; ‘and you must have all\nthe talk, and let me listen. Come, and sit by me. I was sure you\nwouldn’t break your word, and I’ll make you promise again, before you\ngo.’\n\n“I knew now that I mustn’t tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly\nand put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way. I had\nbrought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little\nof one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open:\nhaving gathered venom with reflection. He advanced direct to us, seized\nLinton by the arm, and swung him off the seat.\n\n“‘Get to thy own room!’ he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with\npassion; and his face looked swelled and furious. ‘Take her there if\nshe comes to see thee: thou shalln’t keep me out of this. Begone wi’ ye\nboth!’\n\n“He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him\ninto the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly\nlonging to knock me down. I was afraid for a moment, and I let one\nvolume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out. I heard a\nmalignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious\nJoseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering.\n\n“‘I wer sure he’d sarve ye out! He’s a grand lad! He’s getten t’ raight\nsperrit in him! _He_ knaws—ay, he knaws, as weel as I do, who sud be t’\nmaister yonder—Ech, ech, ech! He made ye skift properly! Ech, ech,\nech!’\n\n“‘Where must we go?’ I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old\nwretch’s mockery.\n\n“Linton was white and trembling. He was not pretty then, Ellen: oh, no!\nhe looked frightful; for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into\nan expression of frantic, powerless fury. He grasped the handle of the\ndoor, and shook it: it was fastened inside.\n\n“‘If you don’t let me in, I’ll kill you!—If you don’t let me in, I’ll\nkill you!’ he rather shrieked than said. ‘Devil! devil!—I’ll kill\nyou—I’ll kill you!’\n\n“Joseph uttered his croaking laugh again.\n\n“‘Thear, that’s t’ father!’ he cried. ‘That’s father! We’ve allas\nsummut o’ either side in us. Niver heed, Hareton, lad—dunnut be\n’feard—he cannot get at thee!’\n\n“I took hold of Linton’s hands, and tried to pull him away; but he\nshrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed. At last his cries were\nchoked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and\nhe fell on the ground. I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and\ncalled for Zillah, as loud as I could. She soon heard me: she was\nmilking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work,\nshe inquired what there was to do? I hadn’t breath to explain; dragging\nher in, I looked about for Linton. Earnshaw had come out to examine the\nmischief he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing\nupstairs. Zillah and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top\nof the steps, and said I shouldn’t go in: I must go home. I exclaimed\nthat he had killed Linton, and I _would_ enter. Joseph locked the door,\nand declared I should do ‘no sich stuff,’ and asked me whether I were\n‘bahn to be as mad as him.’ I stood crying till the housekeeper\nreappeared. She affirmed he would be better in a bit, but he couldn’t\ndo with that shrieking and din; and she took me, and nearly carried me\ninto the house.\n\n“Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head! I sobbed and wept so\nthat my eyes were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy\nwith stood opposite: presuming every now and then to bid me ‘wisht,’\nand denying that it was his fault; and, finally, frightened by my\nassertions that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison\nand hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide\nhis cowardly agitation. Still, I was not rid of him: when at length\nthey compelled me to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the\npremises, he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road-side, and\nchecked Minny and took hold of me.\n\n“‘Miss Catherine, I’m ill grieved,’ he began, ‘but it’s rayther too\nbad—’\n\n“I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me. He\nlet go, thundering one of his horrid curses, and I galloped home more\nthan half out of my senses.\n\n“I didn’t bid you good-night that evening, and I didn’t go to Wuthering\nHeights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely\nexcited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and\nsometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton. On the\nthird day I took courage: at least, I couldn’t bear longer suspense,\nand stole off once more. I went at five o’clock, and walked; fancying I\nmight manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton’s room,\nunobserved. However, the dogs gave notice of my approach. Zillah\nreceived me, and saying ‘the lad was mending nicely,’ showed me into a\nsmall, tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I\nbeheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my books. But he\nwould neither speak to me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen:\nhe has such an unhappy temper. And what quite confounded me, when he\ndid open his mouth, it was to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned\nthe uproar, and Hareton was not to blame! Unable to reply, except\npassionately, I got up and walked from the room. He sent after me a\nfaint ‘Catherine!’ He did not reckon on being answered so: but I\nwouldn’t turn back; and the morrow was the second day on which I stayed\nat home, nearly determined to visit him no more. But it was so\nmiserable going to bed and getting up, and never hearing anything about\nhim, that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed.\nIt _had_ appeared wrong to take the journey once; now it seemed wrong\nto refrain. Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny; I said ‘Yes,’\nand considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills. I was\nforced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it was no use\ntrying to conceal my presence.\n\n“‘Young master is in the house,’ said Zillah, as she saw me making for\nthe parlour. I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the\nroom directly. Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking\nup to the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be\ntrue—\n\n“‘As you don’t like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to\nhurt you, and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last\nmeeting: let us say good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no\nwish to see me, and that he mustn’t invent any more falsehoods on the\nsubject.’\n\n“‘Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine,’ he answered. ‘You are so\nmuch happier than I am, you ought to be better. Papa talks enough of my\ndefects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should\ndoubt myself. I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he\ncalls me, frequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate\neverybody! I _am_ worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit,\nalmost always; and, if you choose, you _may_ say good-bye: you’ll get\nrid of an annoyance. Only, Catherine, do me this justice: believe that\nif I might be as sweet, and as kind, and as good as you are, I would\nbe; as willingly, and more so, than as happy and as healthy. And\nbelieve that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if I\ndeserved your love: and though I couldn’t, and cannot help showing my\nnature to you, I regret it and repent it; and shall regret and repent\nit till I die!’\n\n“I felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him: and, though\nwe should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again. We were\nreconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not\nentirely for sorrow; yet I _was_ sorry Linton had that distorted\nnature. He’ll never let his friends be at ease, and he’ll never be at\nease himself! I have always gone to his little parlour, since that\nnight; because his father returned the day after.\n\n“About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were\nthe first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now\nwith his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I’ve\nlearned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the\nlatter. Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at\nall. Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him\nabusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before. I\ncan’t tell how he knew of it, unless he listened. Linton had certainly\nbehaved provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and\nI interrupted Mr. Heathcliff’s lecture by entering and telling him so.\nHe burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that\nview of the matter. Since then, I’ve told Linton he must whisper his\nbitter things. Now, Ellen, you have heard all. I can’t be prevented\nfrom going to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two\npeople; whereas, if you’ll only not tell papa, my going need disturb\nthe tranquillity of none. You’ll not tell, will you? It will be very\nheartless, if you do.”\n\n“I’ll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine,” I\nreplied. “It requires some study; and so I’ll leave you to your rest,\nand go think it over.”\n\nI thought it over aloud, in my master’s presence; walking straight from\nher room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of\nher conversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton. Mr.\nLinton was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to\nme. In the morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and\nshe learnt also that her secret visits were to end. In vain she wept\nand writhed against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity\non Linton: all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write\nand give him leave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but\nexplaining that he must no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering\nHeights. Perhaps, had he been aware of his nephew’s disposition and\nstate of health, he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight\nconsolation.\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n“These things happened last winter, sir,” said Mrs. Dean; “hardly more\nthan a year ago. Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve\nmonths’ end, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating\nthem! Yet, who knows how long you’ll be a stranger? You’re too young to\nrest always contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy no one\ncould see Catherine Linton and not love her. You smile; but why do you\nlook so lively and interested when I talk about her? and why have you\nasked me to hang her picture over your fireplace? and why—?”\n\n“Stop, my good friend!” I cried. “It may be very possible that _I_\nshould love her; but would she love me? I doubt it too much to venture\nmy tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my home is not\nhere. I’m of the busy world, and to its arms I must return. Go on. Was\nCatherine obedient to her father’s commands?”\n\n“She was,” continued the housekeeper. “Her affection for him was still\nthe chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke\nin the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils\nand foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he\ncould bequeath to guide her. He said to me, a few days afterwards, ‘I\nwish my nephew would write, Ellen, or call. Tell me, sincerely, what\nyou think of him: is he changed for the better, or is there a prospect\nof improvement, as he grows a man?’\n\n“‘He’s very delicate, sir,’ I replied; ‘and scarcely likely to reach\nmanhood: but this I can say, he does not resemble his father; and if\nMiss Catherine had the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond\nher control: unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.\nHowever, master, you’ll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him\nand see whether he would suit her: it wants four years and more to his\nbeing of age.’”\n\nEdgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton\nKirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and\nwe could just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the\nsparely-scattered gravestones.\n\n“I’ve prayed often,” he half soliloquised, “for the approach of what is\ncoming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it. I thought the memory of\nthe hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than\nthe anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, weeks,\nto be carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow! Ellen, I’ve been very\nhappy with my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she\nwas a living hope at my side. But I’ve been as happy musing by myself\namong those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June\nevenings, on the green mound of her mother’s grave, and\nwishing—yearning for the time when I might lie beneath it. What can I\ndo for Cathy? How must I quit her? I’d not care one moment for Linton\nbeing Heathcliff’s son; nor for his taking her from me, if he could\nconsole her for my loss. I’d not care that Heathcliff gained his ends,\nand triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing! But should Linton be\nunworthy—only a feeble tool to his father—I cannot abandon her to him!\nAnd, hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in\nmaking her sad while I live, and leaving her solitary when I die.\nDarling! I’d rather resign her to God, and lay her in the earth before\nme.”\n\n“Resign her to God as it is, sir,” I answered, “and if we should lose\nyou—which may He forbid—under His providence, I’ll stand her friend and\ncounsellor to the last. Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don’t fear\nthat she will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are\nalways finally rewarded.”\n\nSpring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he\nresumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter. To her\ninexperienced notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and\nthen his cheek was often flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt\nsure of his recovering. On her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit\nthe churchyard: it was raining, and I observed—\n\n“You’ll surely not go out to-night, sir?”\n\nHe answered,—“No, I’ll defer it this year a little longer.”\n\nHe wrote again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and,\nhad the invalid been presentable, I’ve no doubt his father would have\npermitted him to come. As it was, being instructed, he returned an\nanswer, intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the\nGrange; but his uncle’s kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to\nmeet him sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his\ncousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided.\n\nThat part of his letter was simple, and probably his own. Heathcliff\nknew he could plead eloquently for Catherine’s company, then.\n\n“I do not ask,” he said, “that she may visit here; but am I never to\nsee her, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid\nher to come to mine? Do, now and then, ride with her towards the\nHeights; and let us exchange a few words, in your presence! We have\ndone nothing to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me:\nyou have no reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself. Dear uncle! send\nme a kind note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please,\nexcept at Thrushcross Grange. I believe an interview would convince you\nthat my father’s character is not mine: he affirms I am more your\nnephew than his son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy\nof Catherine, she has excused them, and for her sake, you should also.\nYou inquire after my health—it is better; but while I remain cut off\nfrom all hope, and doomed to solitude, or the society of those who\nnever did and never will like me, how can I be cheerful and well?”\n\nEdgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his\nrequest; because he could not accompany Catherine. He said, in summer,\nperhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing\nat intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was\nable by letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.\nLinton complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have\nspoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations:\nbut his father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on\nevery line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his\npeculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly\nuppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being\nheld asunder from his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr.\nLinton must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely\ndeceiving him with empty promises.\n\nCathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length\npersuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk\ntogether about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors\nnearest the Grange: for June found him still declining. Though he had\nset aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady’s fortune,\nhe had a natural desire that she might retain—or at least return in a\nshort time to—the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only\nprospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea\nthat the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one,\nI believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master\nHeathcliff to make report of his condition among us. I, for my part,\nbegan to fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually\nrallying, when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed\nso earnest in pursuing his object. I could not picture a father\ntreating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards\nlearned Heathcliff had treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness:\nhis efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling\nplans were threatened with defeat by death.\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nSummer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his\nassent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first\nride to join her cousin. It was a close, sultry day: devoid of\nsunshine, but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our\nplace of meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.\nOn arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a\nmessenger, told us that,—“Maister Linton wer just o’ this side th’\nHeights: and he’d be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.”\n\n“Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,” I\nobserved: “he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at\nonce.”\n\n“Well, we’ll turn our horses’ heads round when we reach him,” answered\nmy companion; “our excursion shall lie towards home.”\n\nBut when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from\nhis own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount,\nand leave ours to graze. He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach,\nand did not rise till we came within a few yards. Then he walked so\nfeebly, and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed,—“Why, Master\nHeathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning. How ill\nyou do look!”\n\nCatherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the\nejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation\non their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were\nworse than usual?\n\n“No—better—better!” he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if\nhe needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over\nher; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the\nlanguid expression they once possessed.\n\n“But you have been worse,” persisted his cousin; “worse than when I saw\nyou last; you are thinner, and—”\n\n“I’m tired,” he interrupted, hurriedly. “It is too hot for walking, let\nus rest here. And, in the morning, I often feel sick—papa says I grow\nso fast.”\n\nBadly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.\n\n“This is something like your paradise,” said she, making an effort at\ncheerfulness. “You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the\nplace and way each thought pleasantest? This is nearly yours, only\nthere are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer\nthan sunshine. Next week, if you can, we’ll ride down to the Grange\nPark, and try mine.”\n\nLinton did not appear to remember what she talked of; and he had\nevidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation. His\nlack of interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity\nto contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not\nconceal her disappointment. An indefinite alteration had come over his\nwhole person and manner. The pettishness that might be caressed into\nfondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the\npeevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be\nsoothed, and more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed\ninvalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured\nmirth of others as an insult. Catherine perceived, as well as I did,\nthat he held it rather a punishment, than a gratification, to endure\nour company; and she made no scruple of proposing, presently, to\ndepart. That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his lethargy,\nand threw him into a strange state of agitation. He glanced fearfully\ntowards the Heights, begging she would remain another half-hour, at\nleast.\n\n“But I think,” said Cathy, “you’d be more comfortable at home than\nsitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and\nsongs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months;\nyou have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse\nyou, I’d willingly stay.”\n\n“Stay to rest yourself,” he replied. “And, Catherine, don’t think or\nsay that I’m _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make\nme dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me. Tell\nuncle I’m in tolerable health, will you?”\n\n“I’ll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton. I couldn’t affirm that you\nare,” observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion\nof what was evidently an untruth.\n\n“And be here again next Thursday,” continued he, shunning her puzzled\ngaze. “And give him my thanks for permitting you to come—my best\nthanks, Catherine. And—and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked\nyou about me, don’t lead him to suppose that I’ve been extremely silent\nand stupid: don’t look sad and downcast, as you _are_ doing—he’ll be\nangry.”\n\n“I care nothing for his anger,” exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be\nits object.\n\n“But I do,” said her cousin, shuddering. “_Don’t_ provoke him against\nme, Catherine, for he is very hard.”\n\n“Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?” I inquired. “Has he grown\nweary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?”\n\nLinton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by\nhis side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on\nhis breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of\nexhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for\nbilberries, and sharing the produce of her researches with me: she did\nnot offer them to him, for she saw further notice would only weary and\nannoy.\n\n“Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?” she whispered in my ear, at last. “I\ncan’t tell why we should stay. He’s asleep, and papa will be wanting us\nback.”\n\n“Well, we must not leave him asleep,” I answered; “wait till he wakes,\nand be patient. You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to\nsee poor Linton has soon evaporated!”\n\n“Why did _he_ wish to see me?” returned Catherine. “In his crossest\nhumours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious\nmood. It’s just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform—this\ninterview—for fear his father should scold him. But I’m hardly going to\ncome to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for\nordering Linton to undergo this penance. And, though I’m glad he’s\nbetter in health, I’m sorry he’s so much less pleasant, and so much\nless affectionate to me.”\n\n“You think _he is_ better in health, then?” I said.\n\n“Yes,” she answered; “because he always made such a great deal of his\nsufferings, you know. He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell\npapa; but he’s better, very likely.”\n\n“There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,” I remarked; “I should\nconjecture him to be far worse.”\n\nLinton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if\nany one had called his name.\n\n“No,” said Catherine; “unless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you\nmanage to doze out of doors, in the morning.”\n\n“I thought I heard my father,” he gasped, glancing up to the frowning\nnab above us. “You are sure nobody spoke?”\n\n“Quite sure,” replied his cousin. “Only Ellen and I were disputing\nconcerning your health. Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we\nseparated in winter? If you be, I’m certain one thing is not\nstronger—your regard for me: speak,—are you?”\n\nThe tears gushed from Linton’s eyes as he answered, “Yes, yes, I am!”\nAnd, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up\nand down to detect its owner.\n\nCathy rose. “For to-day we must part,” she said. “And I won’t conceal\nthat I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I’ll\nmention it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr.\nHeathcliff.”\n\n“Hush,” murmured Linton; “for God’s sake, hush! He’s coming.” And he\nclung to Catherine’s arm, striving to detain her; but at that\nannouncement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who\nobeyed her like a dog.\n\n“I’ll be here next Thursday,” she cried, springing to the saddle.\n“Good-bye. Quick, Ellen!”\n\nAnd so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed\nwas he in anticipating his father’s approach.\n\nBefore we reached home, Catherine’s displeasure softened into a\nperplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague,\nuneasy doubts about Linton’s actual circumstances, physical and social:\nin which I partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a\nsecond journey would make us better judges. My master requested an\naccount of our ongoings. His nephew’s offering of thanks was duly\ndelivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also threw little\nlight on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide and what to\nreveal.\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nSeven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth\nrapid alteration of Edgar Linton’s state. The havoc that months had\npreviously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours. Catherine\nwe would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to\ndelude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful\nprobability, gradually ripening into certainty. She had not the heart\nto mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her,\nand obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library,\nwhere her father stopped a short time daily—the brief period he could\nbear to sit up—and his chamber, had become her whole world. She grudged\neach moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by\nhis side. Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my\nmaster gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a\nhappy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that\nshe would not now be left entirely alone after his death.\n\nHe had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall,\nthat, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in\nmind; for Linton’s letters bore few or no indications of his defective\ncharacter. And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from\ncorrecting the error; asking myself what good there would be in\ndisturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power\nnor opportunity to turn to account.\n\nWe deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of\nAugust: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed\nwhoever respired it, though dying, might revive. Catherine’s face was\njust like the landscape—shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid\nsuccession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more\ntransient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that\npassing forgetfulness of its cares.\n\nWe discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.\nMy young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to\nstay a very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on\nhorseback; but I dissented: I wouldn’t risk losing sight of the charge\ncommitted to me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.\nMaster Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion:\nnot the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked\nmore like fear.\n\n“It is late!” he said, speaking short and with difficulty. “Is not your\nfather very ill? I thought you wouldn’t come.”\n\n“_Why_ won’t you be candid?” cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting.\n“Why cannot you say at once you don’t want me? It is strange, Linton,\nthat for the second time you have brought me here on purpose,\napparently to distress us both, and for no reason besides!”\n\nLinton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed;\nbut his cousin’s patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical\nbehaviour.\n\n“My father _is_ very ill,” she said; “and why am I called from his\nbedside? Why didn’t you send to absolve me from my promise, when you\nwished I wouldn’t keep it? Come! I desire an explanation: playing and\ntrifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can’t dance\nattendance on your affectations now!”\n\n“My affectations!” he murmured; “what are they? For heaven’s sake,\nCatherine, don’t look so angry! Despise me as much as you please; I am\na worthless, cowardly wretch: I can’t be scorned enough; but I’m too\nmean for your anger. Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.”\n\n“Nonsense!” cried Catherine in a passion. “Foolish, silly boy! And\nthere! he trembles, as if I were really going to touch him! You needn’t\nbespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your\nservice. Get off! I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from\nthe hearth-stone, and pretending—what do we pretend? Let go my frock!\nIf I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should\nspurn such pity. Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is. Rise,\nand don’t degrade yourself into an abject reptile—_don’t_!”\n\nWith streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his\nnerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite\nterror.\n\n“Oh!” he sobbed, “I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I’m a\ntraitor, too, and I dare not tell you! But leave me, and I shall be\nkilled! _Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said\nyou loved me, and if you did, it wouldn’t harm you. You’ll not go,\nthen? kind, sweet, good Catherine! And perhaps you _will_ consent—and\nhe’ll let me die with you!”\n\nMy young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him.\nThe old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she\ngrew thoroughly moved and alarmed.\n\n“Consent to what?” she asked. “To stay! tell me the meaning of this\nstrange talk, and I will. You contradict your own words, and distract\nme! Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your\nheart. You wouldn’t injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn’t let any\nenemy hurt me, if you could prevent it? I’ll believe you are a coward,\nfor yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.”\n\n“But my father threatened me,” gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated\nfingers, “and I dread him—I dread him! I _dare_ not tell!”\n\n“Oh, well!” said Catherine, with scornful compassion, “keep your\nsecret: _I’m_ no coward. Save yourself: I’m not afraid!”\n\nHer magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her\nsupporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out. I was\ncogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should\nnever suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when,\nhearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff\nalmost close upon us, descending the Heights. He didn’t cast a glance\ntowards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton’s\nsobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed\nto none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn’t avoid doubting,\nhe said—\n\n“It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly. How are you at\nthe Grange? Let us hear. The rumour goes,” he added, in a lower tone,\n“that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his\nillness?”\n\n“No; my master is dying,” I replied: “it is true enough. A sad thing it\nwill be for us all, but a blessing for him!”\n\n“How long will he last, do you think?” he asked.\n\n“I don’t know,” I said.\n\n“Because,” he continued, looking at the two young people, who were\nfixed under his eye—Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir\nor raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his\naccount—“because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I’d\nthank his uncle to be quick, and go before him! Hallo! has the whelp\nbeen playing that game long? I _did_ give him some lessons about\nsnivelling. Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?”\n\n“Lively? no—he has shown the greatest distress,” I answered. “To see\nhim, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the\nhills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.”\n\n“He shall be, in a day or two,” muttered Heathcliff. “But first—get up,\nLinton! Get up!” he shouted. “Don’t grovel on the ground there: up,\nthis moment!”\n\nLinton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,\ncaused by his father’s glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing\nelse to produce such humiliation. He made several efforts to obey, but\nhis little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back\nagain with a moan. Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean\nagainst a ridge of turf.\n\n“Now,” said he, with curbed ferocity, “I’m getting angry—and if you\ndon’t command that paltry spirit of yours—_damn_ you! get up directly!”\n\n“I will, father,” he panted. “Only, let me alone, or I shall faint.\nI’ve done as you wished, I’m sure. Catherine will tell you that I—that\nI—have been cheerful. Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.”\n\n“Take mine,” said his father; “stand on your feet. There now—she’ll\nlend you her arm: that’s right, look at _her_. You would imagine I was\nthe devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to\nwalk home with him, will you? He shudders if I touch him.”\n\n“Linton dear!” whispered Catherine, “I can’t go to Wuthering Heights:\npapa has forbidden me. He’ll not harm you: why are you so afraid?”\n\n“I can never re-enter that house,” he answered. “I’m _not_ to re-enter\nit without you!”\n\n“Stop!” cried his father. “We’ll respect Catherine’s filial scruples.\nNelly, take him in, and I’ll follow your advice concerning the doctor,\nwithout delay.”\n\n“You’ll do well,” replied I. “But I must remain with my mistress: to\nmind your son is not my business.”\n\n“You are very stiff,” said Heathcliff, “I know that: but you’ll force\nme to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.\nCome, then, my hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?”\n\nHe approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile\nbeing; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored\nher to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no\ndenial. However I disapproved, I couldn’t hinder her: indeed, how could\nshe have refused him herself? What was filling him with dread we had no\nmeans of discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and\nany addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy. We reached the\nthreshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had\nconducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when\nMr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed—“My house is not stricken\nwith the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit\ndown, and allow me to shut the door.”\n\nHe shut and locked it also. I started.\n\n“You shall have tea before you go home,” he added. “I am by myself.\nHareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are\noff on a journey of pleasure; and, though I’m used to being alone, I’d\nrather have some interesting company, if I can get it. Miss Linton,\ntake your seat by _him_. I give you what I have: the present is hardly\nworth accepting; but I have nothing else to offer. It is Linton, I\nmean. How she does stare! It’s odd what a savage feeling I have to\nanything that seems afraid of me! Had I been born where laws are less\nstrict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow\nvivisection of those two, as an evening’s amusement.”\n\nHe drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, “By\nhell! I hate them.”\n\n“I am not afraid of you!” exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the\nlatter part of his speech. She stepped close up; her black eyes\nflashing with passion and resolution. “Give me that key: I will have\nit!” she said. “I wouldn’t eat or drink here, if I were starving.”\n\nHeathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table. He\nlooked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or,\npossibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom\nshe inherited it. She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in\ngetting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to\nthe present; he recovered it speedily.\n\n“Now, Catherine Linton,” he said, “stand off, or I shall knock you\ndown; and that will make Mrs. Dean mad.”\n\nRegardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its\ncontents again. “We _will_ go!” she repeated, exerting her utmost\nefforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails\nmade no impression, she applied her teeth pretty sharply. Heathcliff\nglanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment.\nCatherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He opened\nthem suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had\nwell secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling\nher on his knee, administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps\non both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his\nthreat, had she been able to fall.\n\nAt this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. “You villain!” I\nbegan to cry, “you villain!” A touch on the chest silenced me: I am\nstout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I\nstaggered dizzily back, and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a\nblood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released,\nput her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not\nsure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor\nthing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.\n\n“I know how to chastise children, you see,” said the scoundrel, grimly,\nas he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the\nfloor. “Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease! I shall\nbe your father, to-morrow—all the father you’ll have in a few days—and\nyou shall have plenty of that. You can bear plenty; you’re no weakling:\nyou shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in\nyour eyes again!”\n\nCathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning\ncheek on my lap, weeping aloud. Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of\nthe settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say,\nthat the correction had alighted on another than him. Mr. Heathcliff,\nperceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea\nhimself. The cups and saucers were laid ready. He poured it out, and\nhanded me a cup.\n\n“Wash away your spleen,” he said. “And help your own naughty pet and\nmine. It is not poisoned, though I prepared it. I’m going out to seek\nyour horses.”\n\nOur first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We\ntried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the\nwindows—they were too narrow for even Cathy’s little figure.\n\n“Master Linton,” I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, “you\nknow what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or\nI’ll box your ears, as he has done your cousin’s.”\n\n“Yes, Linton, you must tell,” said Catherine. “It was for your sake I\ncame; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.”\n\n“Give me some tea, I’m thirsty, and then I’ll tell you,” he answered.\n“Mrs. Dean, go away. I don’t like you standing over me. Now, Catherine,\nyou are letting your tears fall into my cup. I won’t drink that. Give\nme another.”\n\nCatherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted\nat the little wretch’s composure, since he was no longer in terror for\nhimself. The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as\never he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been menaced\nwith an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there;\nand, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.\n\n“Papa wants us to be married,” he continued, after sipping some of the\nliquid. “And he knows your papa wouldn’t let us marry now; and he’s\nafraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning,\nand you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you\nshall return home next day, and take me with you.”\n\n“Take you with her, pitiful changeling!” I exclaimed. “_You_ marry?\nWhy, the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one. And do you\nimagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie\nherself to a little perishing monkey like you? Are you cherishing the\nnotion that _anybody_, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you\nfor a husband? You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with\nyour dastardly puling tricks: and—don’t look so silly, now! I’ve a very\ngood mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and\nyour imbecile conceit.”\n\nI did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he\ntook to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine\nrebuked me.\n\n“Stay all night? No,” she said, looking slowly round. “Ellen, I’ll burn\nthat door down but I’ll get out.”\n\nAnd she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but\nLinton was up in alarm for his dear self again. He clasped her in his\ntwo feeble arms sobbing:—“Won’t you have me, and save me? not let me\ncome to the Grange? Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn’t go and leave,\nafter all. You _must_ obey my father—you _must_!”\n\n“I must obey my own,” she replied, “and relieve him from this cruel\nsuspense. The whole night! What would he think? He’ll be distressed\nalready. I’ll either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet!\nYou’re in no danger; but if you hinder me—Linton, I love papa better\nthan you!”\n\nThe mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff’s anger restored to the boy\nhis coward’s eloquence. Catherine was near distraught: still, she\npersisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn,\npersuading him to subdue his selfish agony. While they were thus\noccupied, our jailor re-entered.\n\n“Your beasts have trotted off,” he said, “and—now Linton! snivelling\nagain? What has she been doing to you? Come, come—have done, and get to\nbed. In a month or two, my lad, you’ll be able to pay her back her\npresent tyrannies with a vigorous hand. You’re pining for pure love,\nare you not? nothing else in the world: and she shall have you! There,\nto bed! Zillah won’t be here to-night; you must undress yourself. Hush!\nhold your noise! Once in your own room, I’ll not come near you: you\nneedn’t fear. By chance, you’ve managed tolerably. I’ll look to the\nrest.”\n\nHe spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and\nthe latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected\nthe person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. The lock\nwas re-secured. Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I\nstood silent. Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to\nher cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. Anybody else\nwould have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,\nbut he scowled on her and muttered—“Oh! you are not afraid of me? Your\ncourage is well disguised: you _seem_ damnably afraid!”\n\n“I _am_ afraid now,” she replied, “because, if I stay, papa will be\nmiserable: and how can I endure making him miserable—when he—when\nhe—Mr. Heathcliff, _let_ me go home! I promise to marry Linton: papa\nwould like me to: and I love him. Why should you wish to force me to do\nwhat I’ll willingly do of myself?”\n\n“Let him dare to force you,” I cried. “There’s law in the land, thank\nGod! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place. I’d inform if\nhe were my own son: and it’s felony without benefit of clergy!”\n\n“Silence!” said the ruffian. “To the devil with your clamour! I don’t\nwant _you_ to speak. Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in\nthinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for\nsatisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your\nresidence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing\nme that such an event would follow. As to your promise to marry Linton,\nI’ll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place\ntill it is fulfilled.”\n\n“Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I’m safe!” exclaimed Catherine,\nweeping bitterly. “Or marry me now. Poor papa! Ellen, he’ll think we’re\nlost. What shall we do?”\n\n“Not he! He’ll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a\nlittle amusement,” answered Heathcliff. “You cannot deny that you\nentered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to\nthe contrary. And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement\nat your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that\nman _only_ your father. Catherine, his happiest days were over when\nyour days began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world\n(I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went\nout of it. I’d join him. I don’t love you! How should I? Weep away. As\nfar as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless\nLinton make amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears\nto fancy he may. His letters of advice and consolation entertained me\nvastly. In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and\nkind to her when he got her. Careful and kind—that’s paternal. But\nLinton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself.\nLinton can play the little tyrant well. He’ll undertake to torture any\nnumber of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared. You’ll\nbe able to tell his uncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get\nhome again, I assure you.”\n\n“You’re right there!” I said; “explain your son’s character. Show his\nresemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice\nbefore she takes the cockatrice!”\n\n“I don’t much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,” he answered;\n“because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along\nwith her, till your master dies. I can detain you both, quite\nconcealed, here. If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and\nyou’ll have an opportunity of judging!”\n\n“I’ll not retract my word,” said Catherine. “I’ll marry him within this\nhour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff,\nyou’re a cruel man, but you’re not a fiend; and you won’t, from _mere_\nmalice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness. If papa thought I had\nleft him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to\nlive? I’ve given over crying: but I’m going to kneel here, at your\nknee; and I’ll not get up, and I’ll not take my eyes from your face\ntill you look back at me! No, don’t turn away! _do_ look! you’ll see\nnothing to provoke you. I don’t hate you. I’m not angry that you struck\nme. Have you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle? _never_?\nAh! you must look once. I’m so wretched, you can’t help being sorry and\npitying me.”\n\n“Keep your eft’s fingers off; and move, or I’ll kick you!” cried\nHeathcliff, brutally repulsing her. “I’d rather be hugged by a snake.\nHow the devil can you dream of fawning on me? I _detest_ you!”\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept\nwith aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my\nmouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse. But I was rendered\ndumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be\nshown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered. It was\ngrowing dark—we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate. Our host\nhurried out instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not. There\nwas a talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone.\n\n“I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,” I observed to Catherine.\n“I wish he would arrive! Who knows but he might take our part?”\n\n“It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,” said\nHeathcliff, overhearing me. “You should have opened a lattice and\ncalled out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn’t. She’s glad\nto be obliged to stay, I’m certain.”\n\nAt learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief\nwithout control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o’clock. Then\nhe bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah’s chamber; and I\nwhispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get\nthrough the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.\nThe window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap\nwas safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before. We\nneither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and\nwatched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I\ncould obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest. I\nseated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment\non my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the\nmisfortunes of my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I\nam aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I\nthought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.\n\nAt seven o’clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen. She\nran to the door immediately, and answered, “Yes.” “Here, then,” he\nsaid, opening it, and pulling her out. I rose to follow, but he turned\nthe lock again. I demanded my release.\n\n“Be patient,” he replied; “I’ll send up your breakfast in a while.”\n\nI thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily; and Catherine\nasked why I was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it\nanother hour, and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at\nlength, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff’s.\n\n“I’ve brought you something to eat,” said a voice; “oppen t’ door!”\n\nComplying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me\nall day.\n\n“Tak’ it,” he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.\n\n“Stay one minute,” I began.\n\n“Nay,” cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour\nforth to detain him.\n\nAnd there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next\nnight; and another, and another. Five nights and four days I remained,\naltogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a\nmodel of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving\nhis sense of justice or compassion.\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nOn the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step\napproached—lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the\nroom. It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk\nbonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm.\n\n“Eh, dear! Mrs. Dean!” she exclaimed. “Well! there is a talk about you\nat Gimmerton. I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse\nmarsh, and missy with you, till master told me you’d been found, and\nhe’d lodged you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure?\nAnd how long were you in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs. Dean? But\nyou’re not so thin—you’ve not been so poorly, have you?”\n\n“Your master is a true scoundrel!” I replied. “But he shall answer for\nit. He needn’t have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked Zillah. “It’s not his tale: they tell that in\nthe village—about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to\nEarnshaw, when I come in—‘Eh, they’s queer things, Mr. Hareton,\nhappened since I went off. It’s a sad pity of that likely young lass,\nand cant Nelly Dean.’ He stared. I thought he had not heard aught, so I\ntold him the rumour. The master listened, and he just smiled to\nhimself, and said, ‘If they have been in the marsh, they are out now,\nZillah. Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room. You can\ntell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key. The bog-water got\ninto her head, and she would have run home quite flighty, but I fixed\nher till she came round to her senses. You can bid her go to the Grange\nat once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young\nlady will follow in time to attend the squire’s funeral.’”\n\n“Mr. Edgar is not dead?” I gasped. “Oh! Zillah, Zillah!”\n\n“No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,” she replied; “you’re right\nsickly yet. He’s not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another\nday. I met him on the road and asked.”\n\nInstead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened\nbelow, for the way was free. On entering the house, I looked about for\nsome one to give information of Catherine. The place was filled with\nsunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand. As I\nhesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a\nslight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle,\nsole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements\nwith apathetic eyes. “Where is Miss Catherine?” I demanded sternly,\nsupposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching\nhim thus, alone. He sucked on like an innocent.\n\n“Is she gone?” I said.\n\n“No,” he replied; “she’s upstairs: she’s not to go; we won’t let her.”\n\n“You won’t let her, little idiot!” I exclaimed. “Direct me to her room\nimmediately, or I’ll make you sing out sharply.”\n\n“Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,” he\nanswered. “He says I’m not to be soft with Catherine: she’s my wife,\nand it’s shameful that she should wish to leave me. He says she hates\nme and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan’t have\nit: and she shan’t go home! She never shall!—she may cry, and be sick\nas much as she pleases!”\n\nHe resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to\ndrop asleep.\n\n“Master Heathcliff,” I resumed, “have you forgotten all Catherine’s\nkindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when\nshe brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through\nwind and snow to see you? She wept to miss one evening, because you\nwould be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times\ntoo good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though\nyou know he detests you both. And you join him against her. That’s fine\ngratitude, is it not?”\n\nThe corner of Linton’s mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his\nlips.\n\n“Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?” I continued.\n“Think for yourself! As to your money, she does not even know that you\nwill have any. And you say she’s sick; and yet you leave her alone, up\nthere in a strange house! _You_ who have felt what it is to be so\nneglected! You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them,\ntoo; but you won’t pity hers! I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you\nsee—an elderly woman, and a servant merely—and you, after pretending\nsuch affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every\ntear you have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease. Ah! you’re a\nheartless, selfish boy!”\n\n“I can’t stay with her,” he answered crossly. “I’ll not stay by myself.\nShe cries so I can’t bear it. And she won’t give over, though I say\nI’ll call my father. I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle\nher if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the\nroom, moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for\nvexation that I couldn’t sleep.”\n\n“Is Mr. Heathcliff out?” I inquired, perceiving that the wretched\ncreature had no power to sympathise with his cousin’s mental tortures.\n\n“He’s in the court,” he replied, “talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says\nuncle is dying, truly, at last. I’m glad, for I shall be master of the\nGrange after him. Catherine always spoke of it as _her_ house. It isn’t\nhers! It’s mine: papa says everything she has is mine. All her nice\nbooks are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and\nher pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out;\nbut I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine. And\nthen she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I\nshould have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother,\nand on the other uncle, when they were young. That was yesterday—I said\n_they_ were mine, too; and tried to get them from her. The spiteful\nthing wouldn’t let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me. I shrieked\nout—that frightens her—she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges\nand divided the case, and gave me her mother’s portrait; the other she\nattempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained\nit. He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me;\nshe refused, and he—he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain,\nand crushed it with his foot.”\n\n“And were you pleased to see her struck?” I asked: having my designs in\nencouraging his talk.\n\n“I winked,” he answered: “I wink to see my father strike a dog or a\nhorse, he does it so hard. Yet I was glad at first—she deserved\npunishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to\nthe window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her\nteeth, and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the\nbits of the picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall,\nand she has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can’t\nspeak for pain. I don’t like to think so; but she’s a naughty thing for\ncrying continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I’m afraid of her.”\n\n“And you can get the key if you choose?” I said.\n\n“Yes, when I am upstairs,” he answered; “but I can’t walk upstairs\nnow.”\n\n“In what apartment is it?” I asked.\n\n“Oh,” he cried, “I shan’t tell _you_ where it is. It is our secret.\nNobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know. There! you’ve tired\nme—go away, go away!” And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut\nhis eyes again.\n\nI considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring\na rescue for my young lady from the Grange. On reaching it, the\nastonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was\nintense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two\nor three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar’s door:\nbut I bespoke the announcement of it myself. How changed I found him,\neven in those few days! He lay an image of sadness and resignation\nawaiting his death. Very young he looked: though his actual age was\nthirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger, at least. He\nthought of Catherine; for he murmured her name. I touched his hand, and\nspoke.\n\n“Catherine is coming, dear master!” I whispered; “she is alive and\nwell; and will be here, I hope, to-night.”\n\nI trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up,\nlooked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon. As\nsoon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at\nthe Heights. I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite\ntrue. I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I\ndescribe all his father’s brutal conduct—my intentions being to add no\nbitterness, if I could help it, to his already overflowing cup.\n\nHe divined that one of his enemy’s purposes was to secure the personal\nproperty, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why\nhe did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because\nignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.\nHowever, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of\nleaving Catherine’s fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put\nit in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her\nchildren, if she had any, after her. By that means, it could not fall\nto Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die.\n\nHaving received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney,\nand four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young\nlady of her jailor. Both parties were delayed very late. The single\nservant returned first. He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he\narrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance;\nand then Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village\nthat must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before\nmorning. The four men came back unaccompanied also. They brought word\nthat Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would\nnot suffer them to see her. I scolded the stupid fellows well for\nlistening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master; resolving\nto take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at daylight, and storm it\nliterally, unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us. Her\nfather _shall_ see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be\nkilled on his own door-stones in trying to prevent it!\n\nHappily, I was spared the journey and the trouble. I had gone\ndownstairs at three o’clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing\nthrough the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front\ndoor made me jump. “Oh! it is Green,” I said, recollecting myself—“only\nGreen,” and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but\nthe knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately. I put the\njug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself. The harvest moon\nshone clear outside. It was not the attorney. My own sweet little\nmistress sprang on my neck sobbing, “Ellen, Ellen! Is papa alive?”\n\n“Yes,” I cried: “yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe\nwith us again!”\n\nShe wanted to run, breathless as she was, upstairs to Mr. Linton’s\nroom; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink,\nand washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.\nThen I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to\nsay, she should be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared, but soon\ncomprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured\nme she would not complain.\n\nI couldn’t abide to be present at their meeting. I stood outside the\nchamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,\nthen. All was composed, however: Catherine’s despair was as silent as\nher father’s joy. She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed\non her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.\n\nHe died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so. Kissing her cheek, he\nmurmured,—“I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to\nus!” and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant\ngaze, till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed. None\ncould have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely\nwithout a struggle.\n\nWhether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too\nweighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she\nsat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that\ndeathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose. It\nwas well I succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the\nlawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how\nto behave. He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of\nhis delay in obeying my master’s summons. Fortunately, no thought of\nworldly affairs crossed the latter’s mind, to disturb him, after his\ndaughter’s arrival.\n\nMr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the\nplace. He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit. He would have\ncarried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar\nLinton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with\nhis family. There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud\nprotestations against any infringement of its directions. The funeral\nwas hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered\nto stay at the Grange till her father’s corpse had quitted it.\n\nShe told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the\nrisk of liberating her. She heard the men I sent disputing at the door,\nand she gathered the sense of Heathcliff’s answer. It drove her\ndesperate. Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon\nafter I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father\nre-ascended. He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without\nshutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep\nwith Hareton, and his petition was granted for once. Catherine stole\nout before break of day. She dared not try the doors lest the dogs\nshould raise an alarm; she visited the empty chambers and examined\ntheir windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother’s, she got easily\nout of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir-tree\nclose by. Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape,\nnotwithstanding his timid contrivances.\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nThe evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the\nlibrary; now musing mournfully—one of us despairingly—on our loss, now\nventuring conjectures as to the gloomy future.\n\nWe had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would\nbe a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during\nLinton’s life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as\nhousekeeper. That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be\nhoped for; and yet I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect\nof retaining my home and my employment, and, above all, my beloved\nyoung mistress; when a servant—one of the discarded ones, not yet\ndeparted—rushed hastily in, and said “that devil Heathcliff” was coming\nthrough the court: should he fasten the door in his face?\n\nIf we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time. He\nmade no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and\navailed himself of the master’s privilege to walk straight in, without\nsaying a word. The sound of our informant’s voice directed him to the\nlibrary; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.\n\nIt was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest,\neighteen years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the\nsame autumn landscape lay outside. We had not yet lighted a candle, but\nall the apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the\nsplendid head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.\nHeathcliff advanced to the hearth. Time had little altered his person\neither. There was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more\ncomposed, his frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other\ndifference. Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she\nsaw him.\n\n“Stop!” he said, arresting her by the arm. “No more runnings away!\nWhere would you go? I’m come to fetch you home; and I hope you’ll be a\ndutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience. I\nwas embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the\nbusiness: he’s such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you’ll\nsee by his look that he has received his due! I brought him down one\nevening, the day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and\nnever touched him afterwards. I sent Hareton out, and we had the room\nto ourselves. In two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and\nsince then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I\nfancy he sees me often, though I am not near. Hareton says he wakes and\nshrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him\nfrom me; and, whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must\ncome: he’s your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.”\n\n“Why not let Catherine continue here,” I pleaded, “and send Master\nLinton to her? As you hate them both, you’d not miss them: they _can_\nonly be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.”\n\n“I’m seeking a tenant for the Grange,” he answered; “and I want my\nchildren about me, to be sure. Besides, that lass owes me her services\nfor her bread. I’m not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness\nafter Linton is gone. Make haste and get ready, now; and don’t oblige\nme to compel you.”\n\n“I shall,” said Catherine. “Linton is all I have to love in the world,\nand though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and\nme to him, you _cannot_ make us hate each other. And I defy you to hurt\nhim when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!”\n\n“You are a boastful champion,” replied Heathcliff; “but I don’t like\nyou well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the\ntorment, as long as it lasts. It is not I who will make him hateful to\nyou—it is his own sweet spirit. He’s as bitter as gall at your\ndesertion and its consequences: don’t expect thanks for this noble\ndevotion. I heard him draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he\nwould do if he were as strong as I: the inclination is there, and his\nvery weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.”\n\n“I know he has a bad nature,” said Catherine: “he’s your son. But I’m\nglad I’ve a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that\nreason I love him. Mr. Heathcliff, _you_ have _nobody_ to love you;\nand, however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of\nthinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery. You _are_\nmiserable, are you not? Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?\n_Nobody_ loves you—_nobody_ will cry for you when you die! I wouldn’t\nbe you!”\n\nCatherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made\nup her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw\npleasure from the griefs of her enemies.\n\n“You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,” said her father-in-law,\n“if you stand there another minute. Begone, witch, and get your\nthings!”\n\nShe scornfully withdrew. In her absence I began to beg for Zillah’s\nplace at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would\nsuffer it on no account. He bid me be silent; and then, for the first\ntime, allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the\npictures. Having studied Mrs. Linton’s, he said—“I shall have that\nhome. Not because I need it, but—” He turned abruptly to the fire, and\ncontinued, with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a\nsmile—“I’ll tell you what I did yesterday! I got the sexton, who was\ndigging Linton’s grave, to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I\nopened it. I thought, once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her\nface again—it is hers yet!—he had hard work to stir me; but he said it\nwould change if the air blew on it, and so I struck one side of the\ncoffin loose, and covered it up: not Linton’s side, damn him! I wish\nhe’d been soldered in lead. And I bribed the sexton to pull it away\nwhen I’m laid there, and slide mine out too; I’ll have it made so: and\nthen by the time Linton gets to us he’ll not know which is which!”\n\n“You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!” I exclaimed; “were you not\nashamed to disturb the dead?”\n\n“I disturbed nobody, Nelly,” he replied; “and I gave some ease to\nmyself. I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you’ll have a\nbetter chance of keeping me underground, when I get there. Disturbed\nher? No! she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen\nyears—incessantly—remorselessly—till yesternight; and yesternight I was\ntranquil. I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with\nmy heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.”\n\n“And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you\nhave dreamt of then?” I said.\n\n“Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!” he answered. “Do\nyou suppose I dread any change of that sort? I expected such a\ntransformation on raising the lid, but I’m better pleased that it should\nnot commence till I share it. Besides, unless I had received a distinct\nimpression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would\nhardly have been removed. It began oddly. You know I was wild after she\ndied; and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her\nspirit! I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they\ncan, and do, exist among us! The day she was buried, there came a fall\nof snow. In the evening I went to the churchyard. It blew bleak as\nwinter—all round was solitary. I didn’t fear that her fool of a husband\nwould wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring\nthem there. Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the\nsole barrier between us, I said to myself—‘I’ll have her in my arms\nagain! If she be cold, I’ll think it is this north wind that chills\n_me_; and if she be motionless, it is sleep.’ I got a spade from the\ntool-house, and began to delve with all my might—it scraped the coffin;\nI fell to work with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the\nscrews; I was on the point of attaining my object, when it seemed that\nI heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and\nbending down. ‘If I can only get this off,’ I muttered, ‘I wish they\nmay shovel in the earth over us both!’ and I wrenched at it more\ndesperately still. There was another sigh, close at my ear. I appeared\nto feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind. I knew\nno living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as certainly as you\nperceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark, though it\ncannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there: not\nunder me, but on the earth. A sudden sense of relief flowed from my\nheart through every limb. I relinquished my labour of agony, and turned\nconsoled at once: unspeakably consoled. Her presence was with me: it\nremained while I re-filled the grave, and led me home. You may laugh,\nif you will; but I was sure I should see her there. I was sure she was\nwith me, and I could not help talking to her. Having reached the\nHeights, I rushed eagerly to the door. It was fastened; and, I\nremember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance. I\nremember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying\nupstairs, to my room and hers. I looked round impatiently—I felt her by\nme—I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_! I ought to have\nsweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning—from the fervour of\nmy supplications to have but one glimpse! I had not one. She showed\nherself, as she often was in life, a devil to me! And, since then,\nsometimes more and sometimes less, I’ve been the sport of that\nintolerable torture! Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch\nthat, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have\nrelaxed to the feebleness of Linton’s. When I sat in the house with\nHareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when I walked\non the moors I should meet her coming in. When I went from home I\nhastened to return; she _must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was\ncertain! And when I slept in her chamber—I was beaten out of that. I\ncouldn’t lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either\noutside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room,\nor even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a\nchild; and I must open my lids to see. And so I opened and closed them\na hundred times a night—to be always disappointed! It racked me! I’ve\noften groaned aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that\nmy conscience was playing the fiend inside of me. Now, since I’ve seen\nher, I’m pacified—a little. It was a strange way of killing: not by\ninches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me with the\nspectre of a hope through eighteen years!”\n\nMr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet\nwith perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire,\nthe brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the\ngrim aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of\ntrouble, and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one\nabsorbing subject. He only half addressed me, and I maintained silence.\nI didn’t like to hear him talk! After a short period he resumed his\nmeditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the sofa\nto contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied Catherine\nentered, announcing that she was ready, when her pony should be\nsaddled.\n\n“Send that over to-morrow,” said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her,\nhe added: “You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and\nyou’ll need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take,\nyour own feet will serve you. Come along.”\n\n“Good-bye, Ellen!” whispered my dear little mistress. As she kissed me,\nher lips felt like ice. “Come and see me, Ellen; don’t forget.”\n\n“Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!” said her new father. “When\nI wish to speak to you I’ll come here. I want none of your prying at my\nhouse!”\n\nHe signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my\nheart, she obeyed. I watched them, from the window, walk down the\ngarden. Heathcliff fixed Catherine’s arm under his: though she disputed\nthe act at first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into\nthe alley, whose trees concealed them.\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nI have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she\nleft: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her,\nand wouldn’t let me pass. He said Mrs. Linton was “thrang,” and the\nmaster was not in. Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,\notherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living. She thinks\nCatherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk. My\nyoung lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr.\nHeathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his\ndaughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced,\nbeing a narrow-minded, selfish woman. Catherine evinced a child’s\nannoyance at this neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted\nmy informant among her enemies, as securely as if she had done her some\ngreat wrong. I had a long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a\nlittle before you came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; and\nthis is what she told me.\n\n“The first thing Mrs. Linton did,” she said, “on her arrival at the\nHeights, was to run upstairs, without even wishing good-evening to me\nand Joseph; she shut herself into Linton’s room, and remained till\nmorning. Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she\nentered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be\nsent for? her cousin was very ill.\n\n“‘We know that!’ answered Heathcliff; ‘but his life is not worth a\nfarthing, and I won’t spend a farthing on him.’\n\n“‘But I cannot tell how to do,’ she said; ‘and if nobody will help me,\nhe’ll die!’\n\n“‘Walk out of the room,’ cried the master, ‘and let me never hear a\nword more about him! None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act\nthe nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him.’\n\n“Then she began to bother me, and I said I’d had enough plague with the\ntiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton:\nMr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.\n\n“How they managed together, I can’t tell. I fancy he fretted a great\ndeal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little\nrest: one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes. She sometimes\ncame into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would\nfain beg assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never\ndare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that\nKenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to\nadvise or complain, and I always refused to meddle. Once or twice,\nafter we had gone to bed, I’ve happened to open my door again and seen\nher sitting crying on the stairs’-top; and then I’ve shut myself in\nquick, for fear of being moved to interfere. I did pity her then, I’m\nsure: still I didn’t wish to lose my place, you know.\n\n“At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me\nout of my wits, by saying, ‘Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is\ndying—I’m sure he is, this time. Get up, instantly, and tell him.’\n\n“Having uttered this speech, she vanished again. I lay a quarter of an\nhour listening and trembling. Nothing stirred—the house was quiet.\n\n“She’s mistaken, I said to myself. He’s got over it. I needn’t disturb\nthem; and I began to doze. But my sleep was marred a second time by a\nsharp ringing of the bell—the only bell we have, put up on purpose for\nLinton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and\ninform them that he wouldn’t have that noise repeated.\n\n“I delivered Catherine’s message. He cursed to himself, and in a few\nminutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room. I\nfollowed. Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands\nfolded on her knees. Her father-in-law went up, held the light to\nLinton’s face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards he turned to\nher.\n\n“‘Now—Catherine,’ he said, ‘how do you feel?’\n\n“She was dumb.\n\n“‘How do you feel, Catherine?’ he repeated.\n\n“‘He’s safe, and I’m free,’ she answered: ‘I should feel well—but,’ she\ncontinued, with a bitterness she couldn’t conceal, ‘you have left me so\nlong to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death! I\nfeel like death!’\n\n“And she looked like it, too! I gave her a little wine. Hareton and\nJoseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and\nheard our talk from outside, now entered. Joseph was fain, I believe,\nof the lad’s removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was\nmore taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton. But\nthe master bid him get off to bed again: we didn’t want his help. He\nafterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to\nreturn to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself.\n\n“In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to\nbreakfast: she had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she\nwas ill; at which I hardly wondered. I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he\nreplied,—‘Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and\nthen to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell\nme.’”\n\nCathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her\ntwice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts\nat increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.\n\nHeathcliff went up once, to show her Linton’s will. He had bequeathed\nthe whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his\nfather: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act\nduring her week’s absence, when his uncle died. The lands, being a\nminor, he could not meddle with. However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed\nand kept them in his wife’s right and his also: I suppose legally; at\nany rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his\npossession.\n\n“Nobody,” said Zillah, “ever approached her door, except that once, but\nI; and nobody asked anything about her. The first occasion of her\ncoming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon. She had cried\nout, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn’t bear any longer\nbeing in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross\nGrange, and Earnshaw and I needn’t hinder her from descending; so, as\nsoon as she heard Heathcliff’s horse trot off, she made her appearance,\ndonned in black, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as\nplain as a Quaker: she couldn’t comb them out.\n\n“Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:” the kirk, (you know,\nhas no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists’\nor Baptists’ place, I can’t say which it is, at Gimmerton, a chapel.)\n“Joseph had gone,” she continued, “but I thought proper to bide at\nhome. Young folks are always the better for an elder’s over-looking;\nand Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn’t a model of nice behaviour.\nI let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she\nhad been always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good\nleave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed. He\ncoloured up at the news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes.\nThe train-oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute. I saw\nhe meant to give her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted\nto be presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master\nis by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.\nHe grew sullen, and began to swear.\n\n“Now, Mrs. Dean,” Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner,\n“you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen\nyou’re right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg\nlower. And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her,\nnow? She’s as poor as you or I: poorer, I’ll be bound: you’re saving,\nand I’m doing my little all that road.”\n\nHareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into\na good humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former\ninsults, he tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper’s\naccount.\n\n“Missis walked in,” she said, “as chill as an icicle, and as high as a\nprincess. I got up and offered her my seat in the arm-chair. No, she\nturned up her nose at my civility. Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come\nto the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved.\n\n“‘I’ve been starved a month and more,’ she answered, resting on the\nword as scornful as she could.\n\n“And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both\nof us. Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and\ndiscovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her\nfeet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up. Her\ncousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage\nto help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that\ncame to hand.\n\n“That was a great advance for the lad. She didn’t thank him; still, he\nfelt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to\nstand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what\nstruck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was\nhe daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his\nfinger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking\nat her instead of the book. She continued reading, or seeking for\nsomething to read. His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in\nthe study of her thick silky curls: her face he couldn’t see, and she\ncouldn’t see him. And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but\nattracted like a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring\nto touching; he put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if\nit were a bird. He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started\nround in such a taking.\n\n“‘Get away this moment! How dare you touch me? Why are you stopping\nthere?’ she cried, in a tone of disgust. ‘I can’t endure you! I’ll go\nupstairs again, if you come near me.’\n\n“Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat down\nin the settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes\nanother half hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me.\n\n“‘Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah? I’m stalled of doing naught;\nand I do like—I could like to hear her! Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask\nof yourseln.’\n\n“‘Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma’am,’ I said, immediately.\n‘He’d take it very kind—he’d be much obliged.’\n\n“She frowned; and looking up, answered—\n\n“‘Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to\nunderstand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the\nhypocrisy to offer! I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any\nof you! When I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see\none of your faces, you all kept off. But I won’t complain to you! I’m\ndriven down here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your\nsociety.’\n\n“‘What could I ha’ done?’ began Earnshaw. ‘How was I to blame?’\n\n“‘Oh! you are an exception,’ answered Mrs. Heathcliff. ‘I never missed\nsuch a concern as you.’\n\n“‘But I offered more than once, and asked,’ he said, kindling up at her\npertness, ‘I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you—’\n\n“‘Be silent! I’ll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your\ndisagreeable voice in my ear!’ said my lady.\n\n“Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him! and unslinging his\ngun, restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer. He\ntalked now, freely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her\nsolitude: but the frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was\nforced to condescend to our company, more and more. However, I took\ncare there should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since,\nI’ve been as stiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us:\nand she does not deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her,\nand she’ll curl back without respect of any one. She’ll snap at the\nmaster himself, and as good as dares him to thrash her; and the more\nhurt she gets, the more venomous she grows.”\n\nAt first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my\nsituation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me:\nbut Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up Hareton\nin an independent house; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless\nshe could marry again; and that scheme it does not come within my\nprovince to arrange.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThus ended Mrs. Dean’s story. Notwithstanding the doctor’s prophecy, I\nam rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second week\nin January, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or two, and\nriding over to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall\nspend the next six months in London; and, if he likes, he may look out\nfor another tenant to take the place after October. I would not pass\nanother winter here for much.\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nYesterday was bright, calm, and frosty. I went to the Heights as I\nproposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to\nher young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not\nconscious of anything odd in her request. The front door stood open,\nbut the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and\ninvoked Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I\nentered. The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. I took\nparticular notice of him this time; but then he does his best\napparently to make the least of his advantages.\n\nI asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home? He answered, No; but he would\nbe in at dinner-time. It was eleven o’clock, and I announced my\nintention of going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately\nflung down his tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not\nas a substitute for the host.\n\nWe entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in\npreparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more\nsulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first. She hardly\nraised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the\nsame disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning\nmy bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.\n\n“She does not seem so amiable,” I thought, “as Mrs. Dean would persuade\nme to believe. She’s a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.”\n\nEarnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen. “Remove them\nyourself,” she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and\nretiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of\nbirds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap. I approached\nher, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied,\nadroitly dropped Mrs. Dean’s note on to her knee, unnoticed by\nHareton—but she asked aloud, “What is that?” And chucked it off.\n\n“A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,” I\nanswered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it\nshould be imagined a missive of my own. She would gladly have gathered\nit up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it\nin his waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first.\nThereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very\nstealthily, drew out her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her\neyes; and her cousin, after struggling awhile to keep down his softer\nfeelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her,\nas ungraciously as he could. Catherine caught and perused it eagerly;\nthen she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and\nirrational, of her former home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured\nin soliloquy:\n\n“I should like to be riding Minny down there! I should like to be\nclimbing up there! Oh! I’m tired—I’m _stalled_, Hareton!” And she leant\nher pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a\nsigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring\nnor knowing whether we remarked her.\n\n“Mrs. Heathcliff,” I said, after sitting some time mute, “you are not\naware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it\nstrange you won’t come and speak to me. My housekeeper never wearies of\ntalking about and praising you; and she’ll be greatly disappointed if I\nreturn with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter\nand said nothing!”\n\nShe appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,—\n\n“Does Ellen like you?”\n\n“Yes, very well,” I replied, hesitatingly.\n\n“You must tell her,” she continued, “that I would answer her letter,\nbut I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might\ntear a leaf.”\n\n“No books!” I exclaimed. “How do you contrive to live here without\nthem? if I may take the liberty to inquire. Though provided with a\nlarge library, I’m frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books\naway, and I should be desperate!”\n\n“I was always reading, when I had them,” said Catherine; “and Mr.\nHeathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my\nbooks. I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks. Only once, I searched\nthrough Joseph’s store of theology, to his great irritation; and once,\nHareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room—some Latin and Greek,\nand some tales and poetry: all old friends. I brought the last here—and\nyou gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love\nof stealing! They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in\nthe bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall.\nPerhaps _your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my\ntreasures? But I’ve most of them written on my brain and printed in my\nheart, and you cannot deprive me of those!”\n\nEarnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his\nprivate literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of\nher accusations.\n\n“Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,” I\nsaid, coming to his rescue. “He is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your\nattainments. He’ll be a clever scholar in a few years.”\n\n“And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,” answered Catherine.\n“Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty\nblunders he makes! I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did\nyesterday: it was extremely funny. I heard you; and I heard you turning\nover the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing\nbecause you couldn’t read their explanations!”\n\nThe young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at\nfor his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it. I had a\nsimilar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean’s anecdote of his first\nattempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I\nobserved,—“But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and\neach stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned\ninstead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.”\n\n“Oh!” she replied, “I don’t wish to limit his acquirements: still, he\nhas no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me\nwith his vile mistakes and mispronunciations! Those books, both prose\nand verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to\nhave them debased and profaned in his mouth! Besides, of all, he has\nselected my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out\nof deliberate malice.”\n\nHareton’s chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe\nsense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to\nsuppress. I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his\nembarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the\nexternal prospect as I stood. He followed my example, and left the\nroom; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his\nhands, which he threw into Catherine’s lap, exclaiming,—“Take them! I\nnever want to hear, or read, or think of them again!”\n\n“I won’t have them now,” she answered. “I shall connect them with you,\nand hate them.”\n\nShe opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a\nportion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it\nfrom her. “And listen,” she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse\nof an old ballad in the same fashion.\n\nBut his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not\naltogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue.\nThe little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin’s sensitive\nthough uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode\nhe had of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the\ninflictor. He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the\nfire. I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that\nsacrifice to spleen. I fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the\npleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing\npleasure he had anticipated from them; and I fancied I guessed the\nincitement to his secret studies also. He had been content with daily\nlabour and rough animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path.\nShame at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters\nto higher pursuits; and instead of guarding him from one and winning\nhim to the other, his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the\ncontrary result.\n\n“Yes, that’s all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!”\ncried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the\nconflagration with indignant eyes.\n\n“You’d _better_ hold your tongue, now,” he answered fiercely.\n\nAnd his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the\nentrance, where I made way for him to pass. But ere he had crossed the\ndoor-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him,\nand laying hold of his shoulder asked,—“What’s to do now, my lad?”\n\n“Naught, naught,” he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger\nin solitude.\n\nHeathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.\n\n“It will be odd if I thwart myself,” he muttered, unconscious that I\nwas behind him. “But when I look for his father in his face, I find\n_her_ every day more! How the devil is he so like? I can hardly bear to\nsee him.”\n\nHe bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in. There was a\nrestless, anxious expression in his countenance, I had never remarked\nthere before; and he looked sparer in person. His daughter-in-law, on\nperceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen,\nso that I remained alone.\n\n“I’m glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,” he said, in\nreply to my greeting; “from selfish motives partly: I don’t think I\ncould readily supply your loss in this desolation. I’ve wondered more\nthan once what brought you here.”\n\n“An idle whim, I fear, sir,” was my answer; “or else an idle whim is\ngoing to spirit me away. I shall set out for London next week; and I\nmust give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross\nGrange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it. I believe I shall\nnot live there any more.”\n\n“Oh, indeed; you’re tired of being banished from the world, are you?”\nhe said. “But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you\nwon’t occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my\ndue from any one.”\n\n“I’m coming to plead off nothing about it,” I exclaimed, considerably\nirritated. “Should you wish it, I’ll settle with you now,” and I drew\nmy note-book from my pocket.\n\n“No, no,” he replied, coolly; “you’ll leave sufficient behind to cover\nyour debts, if you fail to return: I’m not in such a hurry. Sit down\nand take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his\nvisit can generally be made welcome. Catherine! bring the things in:\nwhere are you?”\n\nCatherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.\n\n“You may get your dinner with Joseph,” muttered Heathcliff, aside, “and\nremain in the kitchen till he is gone.”\n\nShe obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no\ntemptation to transgress. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she\nprobably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets\nthem.\n\nWith Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton,\nabsolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and\nbade adieu early. I would have departed by the back way, to get a last\nglimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders\nto lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I\ncould not fulfil my wish.\n\n“How dreary life gets over in that house!” I reflected, while riding\ndown the road. “What a realisation of something more romantic than a\nfairy tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I\nstruck up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated\ntogether into the stirring atmosphere of the town!”\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n1802.—This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend\nin the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came\nwithin fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The ostler at a roadside\npublic-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a\ncart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he\nremarked,—“Yon’s frough Gimmerton, nah! They’re allas three wick’ after\nother folk wi’ ther harvest.”\n\n“Gimmerton?” I repeated—my residence in that locality had already grown\ndim and dreamy. “Ah! I know. How far is it from this?”\n\n“Happen fourteen mile o’er th’ hills; and a rough road,” he answered.\n\nA sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely\nnoon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own\nroof as in an inn. Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange\nmatters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading\nthe neighbourhood again. Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to\ninquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts,\nwe managed the distance in some three hours.\n\nI left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone. The grey church\nlooked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished a\nmoor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm\nweather—too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from\nenjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer\nAugust, I’m sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its\nsolitudes. In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more\ndivine, than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells\nof heath.\n\nI reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the\nfamily had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin,\nblue wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear. I\nrode into the court. Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat\nknitting, and an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a\nmeditative pipe.\n\n“Is Mrs. Dean within?” I demanded of the dame.\n\n“Mistress Dean? Nay!” she answered, “she doesn’t bide here: shoo’s up\nat th’ Heights.”\n\n“Are you the housekeeper, then?” I continued.\n\n“Eea, Aw keep th’ hause,” she replied.\n\n“Well, I’m Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms to lodge me\nin, I wonder? I wish to stay all night.”\n\n“T’ maister!” she cried in astonishment. “Whet, whoiver knew yah wur\ncoming? Yah sud ha’ send word. They’s nowt norther dry nor mensful\nabaht t’ place: nowt there isn’t!”\n\nShe threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I\nentered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover,\nthat I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her\nbe composed. I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to\nprepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to\nsleep in. No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were\nnecessary. She seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the\nhearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker, and\nmalappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I retired,\nconfiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return.\nWuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. An\nafter-thought brought me back, when I had quitted the court.\n\n“All well at the Heights?” I inquired of the woman.\n\n“Eea, f’r owt ee knaw!” she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot\ncinders.\n\nI would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was\nimpossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my\nexit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,\nand the mild glory of a rising moon in front—one fading, and the other\nbrightening—as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road\nbranching off to Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. Before I arrived in sight\nof it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the\nwest: but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of\ngrass, by that splendid moon. I had neither to climb the gate nor to\nknock—it yielded to my hand. That is an improvement, I thought. And I\nnoticed another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and\nwallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.\n\nBoth doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a\ncoal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which\nthe eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. But the house\nof Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space\nfor withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates\nthere were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows. I\ncould both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and\nlistened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of\ncuriosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.\n\n“Con-_trary_!” said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. “That for the\nthird time, you dunce! I’m not going to tell you again. Recollect, or\nI’ll pull your hair!”\n\n“Contrary, then,” answered another, in deep but softened tones. “And\nnow, kiss me, for minding so well.”\n\n“No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.”\n\nThe male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed\nand seated at a table, having a book before him. His handsome features\nglowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the\npage to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a\nsmart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of\ninattention. Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets\nblending, at intervals, with his brown locks, as she bent to\nsuperintend his studies; and her face—it was lucky he could not see her\nface, or he would never have been so steady. I could; and I bit my lip\nin spite, at having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing\nsomething besides staring at its smiting beauty.\n\nThe task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil\nclaimed a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he\ngenerously returned. Then they came to the door, and from their\nconversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on\nthe moors. I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw’s\nheart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions\nif I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and\nfeeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the\nkitchen. There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at\nthe door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which\nwas often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and\nintolerance, uttered in far from musical accents.\n\n“I’d rayther, by th’ haulf, hev’ ’em swearing i’ my lugs fro’h morn to\nneeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!” said the tenant of the kitchen, in\nanswer to an unheard speech of Nelly’s. “It’s a blazing shame, that I\ncannot oppen t’ blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan,\nand all t’ flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th’ warld!\nOh! ye’re a raight nowt; and shoo’s another; and that poor lad ’ll be\nlost atween ye. Poor lad!” he added, with a groan; “he’s witched: I’m\nsartin on’t. Oh, Lord, judge ’em, for there’s norther law nor justice\namong wer rullers!”\n\n“No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,” retorted\nthe singer. “But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian,\nand never mind me. This is ‘Fairy Annie’s Wedding’—a bonny tune—it goes\nto a dance.”\n\nMrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me\ndirectly, she jumped to her feet, crying—“Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!\nHow could you think of returning in this way? All’s shut up at\nThrushcross Grange. You should have given us notice!”\n\n“I’ve arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,”\nI answered. “I depart again to-morrow. And how are you transplanted\nhere, Mrs. Dean? tell me that.”\n\n“Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went\nto London, and stay till you returned. But, step in, pray! Have you\nwalked from Gimmerton this evening?”\n\n“From the Grange,” I replied; “and while they make me lodging room\nthere, I want to finish my business with your master; because I don’t\nthink of having another opportunity in a hurry.”\n\n“What business, sir?” said Nelly, conducting me into the house. “He’s\ngone out at present, and won’t return soon.”\n\n“About the rent,” I answered.\n\n“Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,” she observed;\n“or rather with me. She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I\nact for her: there’s nobody else.”\n\nI looked surprised.\n\n“Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff’s death, I see,” she continued.\n\n“Heathcliff dead!” I exclaimed, astonished. “How long ago?”\n\n“Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I’ll\ntell you all about it. Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?”\n\n“I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home. You sit down too. I\nnever dreamt of his dying! Let me hear how it came to pass. You say you\ndon’t expect them back for some time—the young people?”\n\n“No—I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they\ndon’t care for me. At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do\nyou good: you seem weary.”\n\nShe hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph\nasking whether “it warn’t a crying scandal that she should have\nfollowers at her time of life? And then, to get them jocks out o’ t’\nmaister’s cellar! He fair shaamed to ’bide still and see it.”\n\nShe did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a\nreaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.\nAnd afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff’s\nhistory. He had a “queer” end, as she expressed it.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving\nus, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine’s sake. My first\ninterview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much\nsince our separation. Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for\ntaking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me,\nand he was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my\nsitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to\nsee her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement;\nand, by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other\narticles, that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered\nmyself we should get on in tolerable comfort. The delusion did not last\nlong. Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable\nand restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the\ngarden, and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as\nspring drew on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to\nquit her frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred\nquarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her\nsolitude. I did not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often\nobliged to seek the kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the\nhouse to himself; and though in the beginning she either left it at his\napproach, or quietly joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or\naddressing him—and though he was always as sullen and silent as\npossible—after a while, she changed her behaviour, and became incapable\nof letting him alone: talking at him; commenting on his stupidity and\nidleness; expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he\nlived—how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire, and\ndozing.\n\n“He’s just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?” she once observed, “or a\ncart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What\na blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if\nyou do, what is it about? But you can’t speak to me!”\n\nThen she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look\nagain.\n\n“He’s, perhaps, dreaming now,” she continued. “He twitched his shoulder\nas Juno twitches hers. Ask him, Ellen.”\n\n“Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs, if you don’t\nbehave!” I said. He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his\nfist, as if tempted to use it.\n\n“I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,” she\nexclaimed, on another occasion. “He is afraid I shall laugh at him.\nEllen, what do you think? He began to teach himself to read once; and,\nbecause I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a\nfool?”\n\n“Were not you naughty?” I said; “answer me that.”\n\n“Perhaps I was,” she went on; “but I did not expect him to be so silly.\nHareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I’ll try!”\n\nShe placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and\nmuttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.\n\n“Well, I shall put it here,” she said, “in the table-drawer; and I’m\ngoing to bed.”\n\nThen she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed. But\nhe would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her\ngreat disappointment. I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness\nand indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off\nimproving himself: she had done it effectually. But her ingenuity was\nat work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such\nstationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would\nbring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me. When Hareton was\nthere, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book\nlying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a\nmule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to\nsmoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of\nthe fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense,\nas he would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to\ndisregard it. On fine evenings the latter followed his shooting\nexpeditions, and Catherine yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to\nher, and ran off into the court or garden the moment I began; and, as a\nlast resource, cried, and said she was tired of living: her life was\nuseless.\n\nMr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had\nalmost banished Earnshaw from his apartment. Owing to an accident at\nthe commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the\nkitchen. His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter\ncut his arm, and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach\nhome. The consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the\nfireside and tranquillity, till he made it up again. It suited\nCatherine to have him there: at any rate, it made her hate her room\nupstairs more than ever: and she would compel me to find out business\nbelow, that she might accompany me.\n\nOn Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and,\nin the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen. Earnshaw\nsat, morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was\nbeguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes,\nvarying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered\nejaculations, and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the\ndirection of her cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the\ngrate. At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting my\nlight, she removed to the hearthstone. I bestowed little attention on\nher proceedings, but, presently, I heard her begin—“I’ve found out,\nHareton, that I want—that I’m glad—that I should like you to be my\ncousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me, and so rough.”\n\nHareton returned no answer.\n\n“Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?” she continued.\n\n“Get off wi’ ye!” he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.\n\n“Let me take that pipe,” she said, cautiously advancing her hand and\nabstracting it from his mouth.\n\nBefore he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the\nfire. He swore at her and seized another.\n\n“Stop,” she cried, “you must listen to me first; and I can’t speak\nwhile those clouds are floating in my face.”\n\n“Will you go to the devil!” he exclaimed, ferociously, “and let me be!”\n\n“No,” she persisted, “I won’t: I can’t tell what to do to make you talk\nto me; and you are determined not to understand. When I call you\nstupid, I don’t mean anything: I don’t mean that I despise you. Come,\nyou shall take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall\nown me.”\n\n“I shall have naught to do wi’ you and your mucky pride, and your\ndamned mocking tricks!” he answered. “I’ll go to hell, body and soul,\nbefore I look sideways after you again. Side out o’ t’ gate, now, this\nminute!”\n\nCatherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip,\nand endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing\ntendency to sob.\n\n“You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,” I interrupted,\n“since she repents of her sauciness. It would do you a great deal of\ngood: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.”\n\n“A companion!” he cried; “when she hates me, and does not think me fit\nto wipe her shoon! Nay, if it made me a king, I’d not be scorned for\nseeking her good-will any more.”\n\n“It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!” wept Cathy, no\nlonger disguising her trouble. “You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff\ndoes, and more.”\n\n“You’re a damned liar,” began Earnshaw: “why have I made him angry, by\ntaking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered at\nand despised me, and—Go on plaguing me, and I’ll step in yonder, and\nsay you worried me out of the kitchen!”\n\n“I didn’t know you took my part,” she answered, drying her eyes; “and I\nwas miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you\nto forgive me: what can I do besides?”\n\nShe returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand. He blackened\nand scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely\nclenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground. Catherine, by instinct,\nmust have divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that\nprompted this dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant\nundecided, she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss. The\nlittle rogue thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took\nher former station by the window, quite demurely. I shook my head\nreprovingly, and then she blushed and whispered—“Well! what should I\nhave done, Ellen? He wouldn’t shake hands, and he wouldn’t look: I must\nshow him some way that I like him—that I want to be friends.”\n\nWhether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful,\nfor some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did\nraise it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.\n\nCatherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white\npaper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to\n“Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,” she desired me to be her ambassadress, and\nconvey the present to its destined recipient.\n\n“And tell him, if he’ll take it, I’ll come and teach him to read it\nright,” she said; “and, if he refuse it, I’ll go upstairs, and never\ntease him again.”\n\nI carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my\nemployer. Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee.\nHe did not strike it off, either. I returned to my work. Catherine\nleaned her head and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle\nof the covering being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated\nherself beside her cousin. He trembled, and his face glowed: all his\nrudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him: he could not\nsummon courage, at first, to utter a syllable in reply to her\nquestioning look, and her murmured petition.\n\n“Say you forgive me, Hareton, do. You can make me so happy by speaking\nthat little word.”\n\nHe muttered something inaudible.\n\n“And you’ll be my friend?” added Catherine, interrogatively.\n\n“Nay, you’ll be ashamed of me every day of your life,” he answered;\n“and the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.”\n\n“So you won’t be my friend?” she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and\ncreeping close up.\n\nI overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round\nagain, I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of\nthe accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on\nboth sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.\n\nThe work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their\nposition had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home.\nHe, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated\non the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his\nshoulder; and confounded at his favourite’s endurance of her proximity:\nit affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that\nnight. His emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as\nhe solemnly spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with\ndirty bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day’s\ntransactions. At length he summoned Hareton from his seat.\n\n“Tak’ these in to t’ maister, lad,” he said, “and bide there. I’s gang\nup to my own rahm. This hoile’s neither mensful nor seemly for us: we\nmun side out and seearch another.”\n\n“Come, Catherine,” I said, “we must ‘side out’ too: I’ve done my\nironing. Are you ready to go?”\n\n“It is not eight o’clock!” she answered, rising unwillingly. “Hareton,\nI’ll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I’ll bring some more\nto-morrow.”\n\n“Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak’ into th’ hahse,” said Joseph,\n“and it’ll be mitch if yah find ’em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!”\n\nCathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as\nshe passed Hareton, went singing upstairs: lighter of heart, I venture\nto say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps,\nduring her earliest visits to Linton.\n\nThe intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered\ntemporary interruptions. Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish,\nand my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but\nboth their minds tending to the same point—one loving and desiring to\nesteem, and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed—they contrived\nin the end to reach it.\n\nYou see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff’s\nheart. But now, I’m glad you did not try. The crown of all my wishes\nwill be the union of those two. I shall envy no one on their wedding\nday: there won’t be a happier woman than myself in England!\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nOn the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his\nordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I\nspeedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me,\nas heretofore. She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden,\nwhere she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I\nwent to bid them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to\nclear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and\nthey were busy planning together an importation of plants from the\nGrange.\n\nI was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a\nbrief half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph’s\neye, and she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of\nthem.\n\n“There! That will be all shown to the master,” I exclaimed, “the minute\nit is discovered. And what excuse have you to offer for taking such\nliberties with the garden? We shall have a fine explosion on the head\nof it: see if we don’t! Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more\nwit than to go and make that mess at her bidding!”\n\n“I’d forgotten they were Joseph’s,” answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled;\n“but I’ll tell him I did it.”\n\nWe always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff. I held the mistress’s post\nin making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table. Catherine\nusually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I\npresently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than\nshe had in her hostility.\n\n“Now, mind you don’t talk with and notice your cousin too much,” were\nmy whispered instructions as we entered the room. “It will certainly\nannoy Mr. Heathcliff, and he’ll be mad at you both.”\n\n“I’m not going to,” she answered.\n\nThe minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in\nhis plate of porridge.\n\nHe dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went\non teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.\nI frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was\noccupied on other subjects than his company, as his countenance\nevinced; and she grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with\ndeep gravity. Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at\nlast, Hareton uttered a smothered laugh. Mr. Heathcliff started; his\neye rapidly surveyed our faces. Catherine met it with her accustomed\nlook of nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.\n\n“It is well you are out of my reach,” he exclaimed. “What fiend\npossesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal\neyes? Down with them! and don’t remind me of your existence again. I\nthought I had cured you of laughing.”\n\n“It was me,” muttered Hareton.\n\n“What do you say?” demanded the master.\n\nHareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession. Mr.\nHeathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast\nand his interrupted musing. We had nearly finished, and the two young\npeople prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further\ndisturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door,\nrevealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage\ncommitted on his precious shrubs was detected. He must have seen Cathy\nand her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws\nworked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech\ndifficult to understand, he began:—\n\n“I mun hev’ my wage, and I mun goa! I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I’d\nsarved fur sixty year; and I thowt I’d lug my books up into t’ garret,\nand all my bits o’ stuff, and they sud hev’ t’ kitchen to theirseln;\nfor t’ sake o’ quietness. It wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun, but\nI thowt I _could_ do that! But nah, shoo’s taan my garden fro’ me, and\nby th’ heart, maister, I cannot stand it! Yah may bend to th’ yoak an\nye will—I noan used to ’t, and an old man doesn’t sooin get used to new\nbarthens. I’d rayther arn my bite an’ my sup wi’ a hammer in th’ road!”\n\n“Now, now, idiot!” interrupted Heathcliff, “cut it short! What’s your\ngrievance? I’ll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly. She may\nthrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.”\n\n“It’s noan Nelly!” answered Joseph. “I sudn’t shift for Nelly—nasty ill\nnowt as shoo is. Thank God! _shoo_ cannot stale t’ sowl o’ nob’dy! Shoo\nwer niver soa handsome, but what a body mud look at her ’bout winking.\nIt’s yon flaysome, graceless quean, that’s witched our lad, wi’ her\nbold een and her forrard ways—till—Nay! it fair brusts my heart! He’s\nforgotten all I’ve done for him, and made on him, and goan and riven up\na whole row o’ t’ grandest currant-trees i’ t’ garden!” and here he\nlamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries, and\nEarnshaw’s ingratitude and dangerous condition.\n\n“Is the fool drunk?” asked Mr. Heathcliff. “Hareton, is it you he’s\nfinding fault with?”\n\n“I’ve pulled up two or three bushes,” replied the young man; “but I’m\ngoing to set ’em again.”\n\n“And why have you pulled them up?” said the master.\n\nCatherine wisely put in her tongue.\n\n“We wanted to plant some flowers there,” she cried. “I’m the only\nperson to blame, for I wished him to do it.”\n\n“And who the devil gave _you_ leave to touch a stick about the place?”\ndemanded her father-in-law, much surprised. “And who ordered _you_ to\nobey her?” he added, turning to Hareton.\n\nThe latter was speechless; his cousin replied—“You shouldn’t grudge a\nfew yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my\nland!”\n\n“Your land, insolent slut! You never had any,” said Heathcliff.\n\n“And my money,” she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime\nbiting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast.\n\n“Silence!” he exclaimed. “Get done, and begone!”\n\n“And Hareton’s land, and his money,” pursued the reckless thing.\n“Hareton and I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!”\n\nThe master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose up,\neyeing her all the while, with an expression of mortal hate.\n\n“If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,” she said; “so you may as\nwell sit down.”\n\n“If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I’ll strike him to\nhell,” thundered Heathcliff. “Damnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse\nhim against me? Off with her! Do you hear? Fling her into the kitchen!\nI’ll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!”\n\nHareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go.\n\n“Drag her away!” he cried, savagely. “Are you staying to talk?” And he\napproached to execute his own command.\n\n“He’ll not obey you, wicked man, any more,” said Catherine; “and he’ll\nsoon detest you as much as I do.”\n\n“Wisht! wisht!” muttered the young man, reproachfully; “I will not hear\nyou speak so to him. Have done.”\n\n“But you won’t let him strike me?” she cried.\n\n“Come, then,” he whispered earnestly.\n\nIt was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her.\n\n“Now, _you_ go!” he said to Earnshaw. “Accursed witch! this time she\nhas provoked me when I could not bear it; and I’ll make her repent it\nfor ever!”\n\nHe had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her locks,\nentreating him not to hurt her that once. Heathcliff’s black eyes\nflashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just\nworked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers\nrelaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed\nintently in her face. Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a\nmoment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine,\nsaid, with assumed calmness—“You must learn to avoid putting me in a\npassion, or I shall really murder you some time! Go with Mrs. Dean, and\nkeep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears. As to Hareton\nEarnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I’ll send him seeking his bread\nwhere he can get it! Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.\nNelly, take her; and leave me, all of you! Leave me!”\n\nI led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the\nother followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner.\nI had counselled Catherine to dine upstairs; but, as soon as he\nperceived her vacant seat, he sent me to call her. He spoke to none of\nus, ate very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that\nhe should not return before evening.\n\nThe two new friends established themselves in the house during his\nabsence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her\noffering a revelation of her father-in-law’s conduct to his father. He\nsaid he wouldn’t suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if\nhe were the devil, it didn’t signify; he would stand by him; and he’d\nrather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr.\nHeathcliff. Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to\nmake her hold her tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak\nill of her father? Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the\nmaster’s reputation home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger\nthan reason could break—chains, forged by habit, which it would be\ncruel to attempt to loosen. She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in\navoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning\nHeathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to\nraise a bad spirit between him and Hareton: indeed, I don’t believe she\nhas ever breathed a syllable, in the latter’s hearing, against her\noppressor since.\n\nWhen this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as\nbusy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher. I\ncame in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so\nsoothed and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got\non. You know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long\nbeen proud of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of\nequal satisfaction. His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off\nrapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been\nbred; and Catherine’s sincere commendations acted as a spur to his\nindustry. His brightening mind brightened his features, and added\nspirit and nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same\nindividual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at\nWuthering Heights, after her expedition to the Crags. While I admired\nand they laboured, dusk drew on, and with it returned the master. He\ncame upon us quite unexpectedly, entering by the front way, and had a\nfull view of the whole three, ere we could raise our heads to glance at\nhim. Well, I reflected, there was never a pleasanter, or more harmless\nsight; and it will be a burning shame to scold them. The red fire-light\nglowed on their two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with\nthe eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she\neighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel and learn, that neither\nexperienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.\n\nThey lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps\nyou have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they\nare those of Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has no other\nlikeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of\nthe nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or\nnot. With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at\nall times, _then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were\nalert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity. I suppose\nthis resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in\nevident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young\nman: or, I should say, altered its character; for it was there yet. He\ntook the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then\nreturned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her\ncompanion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart\nalso, but he bid me sit still.\n\n“It is a poor conclusion, is it not?” he observed, having brooded\na while on the scene he had just witnessed: “an absurd termination to\nmy violent exertions? I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two\nhouses, and train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and\nwhen everything is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a\nslate off either roof has vanished! My old enemies have not beaten me;\nnow would be the precise time to revenge myself on their\nrepresentatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me. But where is\nthe use? I don’t care for striking: I can’t take the trouble to raise\nmy hand! That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole time only to\nexhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. It is far from being the case: I\nhave lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle\nto destroy for nothing.\n\n“Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I’m in its shadow at\npresent. I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly\nremember to eat and drink. Those two who have left the room are the\nonly objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and\nthat appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony. About _her_ I won’t\nspeak; and I don’t desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were\ninvisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations. _He_ moves\nme differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I’d\nnever see him again! You’ll perhaps think me rather inclined to become\nso,” he added, making an effort to smile, “if I try to describe the\nthousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.\nBut you’ll not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally\nsecluded in itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.\n\n“Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a\nhuman being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would\nhave been impossible to have accosted him rationally. In the first\nplace, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with\nher. That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my\nimagination, is actually the least: for what is not connected with her\nto me? and what does not recall her? I cannot look down to this floor,\nbut her features are shaped in the flags! In every cloud, in every\ntree—filling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object\nby day—I am surrounded with her image! The most ordinary faces of men\nand women—my own features—mock me with a resemblance. The entire world\nis a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I\nhave lost her! Well, Hareton’s aspect was the ghost of my immortal\nlove; of my wild endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride,\nmy happiness, and my anguish—\n\n“But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you\nknow why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no\nbenefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it\npartly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on\ntogether. I can give them no attention any more.”\n\n“But what do you mean by a _change_, Mr. Heathcliff?” I said, alarmed\nat his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses,\nnor dying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy;\nand, as to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on\ndark things, and entertaining odd fancies. He might have had a\nmonomania on the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point\nhis wits were as sound as mine.\n\n“I shall not know that till it comes,” he said; “I’m only half\nconscious of it now.”\n\n“You have no feeling of illness, have you?” I asked.\n\n“No, Nelly, I have not,” he answered.\n\n“Then you are not afraid of death?” I pursued.\n\n“Afraid? No!” he replied. “I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment,\nnor a hope of death. Why should I? With my hard constitution and\ntemperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and\nprobably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black\nhair on my head. And yet I cannot continue in this condition! I have to\nremind myself to breathe—almost to remind my heart to beat! And it is\nlike bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the\nslightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I\nnotice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one\nuniversal idea. I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties\nare yearning to attain it. They have yearned towards it so long, and so\nunwaveringly, that I’m convinced it _will_ be reached—and\n_soon_—because it has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the\nanticipation of its fulfilment. My confessions have not relieved me;\nbut they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour\nwhich I show. O God! It is a long fight; I wish it were over!”\n\nHe began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I\nwas inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had\nturned his heart to an earthly hell. I wondered greatly how it would\nend. Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by\nlooks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it\nhimself; but not a soul, from his general bearing, would have\nconjectured the fact. You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and\nat the period of which I speak, he was just the same as then; only\nfonder of continued solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in\ncompany.\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nFor some days after that evening, Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at\nmeals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy.\nHe had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing\nrather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed\nsufficient sustenance for him.\n\nOne night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and\nout at the front door. I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning\nI found he was still away. We were in April then: the weather was sweet\nand warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the\ntwo dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom. After\nbreakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with\nmy work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled\nHareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and\narrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the\ninfluence of Joseph’s complaints. I was comfortably revelling in the\nspring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my\nyoung lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose\nroots for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr.\nHeathcliff was coming in. “And he spoke to me,” she added, with a\nperplexed countenance.\n\n“What did he say?” asked Hareton.\n\n“He told me to begone as fast as I could,” she answered. “But he looked\nso different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at\nhim.”\n\n“How?” he inquired.\n\n“Why, almost bright and cheerful. No, _almost_ nothing—_very much_\nexcited, and wild, and glad!” she replied.\n\n“Night-walking amuses him, then,” I remarked, affecting a careless\nmanner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain\nthe truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would\nnot be an every-day spectacle. I framed an excuse to go in. Heathcliff\nstood at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly,\nhe had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of\nhis whole face.\n\n“Will you have some breakfast?” I said. “You must be hungry, rambling\nabout all night!” I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not\nlike to ask directly.\n\n“No, I’m not hungry,” he answered, averting his head, and speaking\nrather contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the\noccasion of his good humour.\n\nI felt perplexed: I didn’t know whether it were not a proper\nopportunity to offer a bit of admonition.\n\n“I don’t think it right to wander out of doors,” I observed, “instead\nof being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season. I\ndaresay you’ll catch a bad cold, or a fever: you have something the\nmatter with you now!”\n\n“Nothing but what I can bear,” he replied; “and with the greatest\npleasure, provided you’ll leave me alone: get in, and don’t annoy me.”\n\nI obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.\n\n“Yes!” I reflected to myself, “we shall have a fit of illness. I cannot\nconceive what he has been doing.”\n\nThat noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate\nfrom my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.\n\n“I’ve neither cold nor fever, Nelly,” he remarked, in allusion to my\nmorning’s speech; “and I’m ready to do justice to the food you give\nme.”\n\nHe took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the\ninclination appeared to become suddenly extinct. He laid them on the\ntable, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out. We\nsaw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal,\nand Earnshaw said he’d go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we\nhad grieved him some way.\n\n“Well, is he coming?” cried Catherine, when her cousin returned.\n\n“Nay,” he answered; “but he’s not angry: he seemed rarely pleased\nindeed; only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he\nbid me be off to you: he wondered how I could want the company of\nanybody else.”\n\nI set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he\nre-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same\nunnatural—it was unnatural—appearance of joy under his black brows; the\nsame bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of\nsmile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness,\nbut as a tight-stretched cord vibrates—a strong thrilling, rather than\ntrembling.\n\nI will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should? And I\nexclaimed—“Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You look\nuncommonly animated.”\n\n“Where should good news come from to me?” he said. “I’m animated with\nhunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.”\n\n“Your dinner is here,” I returned; “why won’t you get it?”\n\n“I don’t want it now,” he muttered, hastily: “I’ll wait till supper.\nAnd, Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other\naway from me. I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this\nplace to myself.”\n\n“Is there some new reason for this banishment?” I inquired. “Tell me\nwhy you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff? Where were you last night? I’m\nnot putting the question through idle curiosity, but—”\n\n“You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,” he\ninterrupted, with a laugh. “Yet I’ll answer it. Last night I was on the\nthreshold of hell. To-day, I am within sight of my heaven. I have my\neyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me! And now you’d better go!\nYou’ll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain\nfrom prying.”\n\nHaving swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed\nthan ever.\n\nHe did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on\nhis solitude; till, at eight o’clock, I deemed it proper, though\nunsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him. He was leaning\nagainst the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was\nturned to the interior gloom. The fire had smouldered to ashes; the\nroom was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so\nstill, that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was\ndistinguishable, but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or\nthrough the large stones which it could not cover. I uttered an\nejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced\nshutting the casements, one after another, till I came to his.\n\n“Must I close this?” I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not\nstir.\n\nThe light flashed on his features as I spoke. Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I\ncannot express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view! Those\ndeep black eyes! That smile, and ghastly paleness! It appeared to me,\nnot Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle\nbend towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.\n\n“Yes, close it,” he replied, in his familiar voice. “There, that is\npure awkwardness! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Be quick,\nand bring another.”\n\nI hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph—“The\nmaster wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.” For I\ndared not go in myself again just then.\n\nJoseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it\nback immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining\nthat Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till\nmorning. We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to\nhis ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its\nwindow, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get\nthrough; and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion,\nof which he had rather we had no suspicion.\n\n“Is he a ghoul or a vampire?” I mused. I had read of such hideous\nincarnate demons. And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him\nin infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost\nthrough his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to\nthat sense of horror. “But where did he come from, the little dark\nthing, harboured by a good man to his bane?” muttered Superstition, as\nI dozed into unconsciousness. And I began, half dreaming, to weary\nmyself with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my\nwaking meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim\nvariations; at last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I\ncan remember is, being exceedingly vexed at having the task of\ndictating an inscription for his monument, and consulting the sexton\nabout it; and, as he had no surname, and we could not tell his age, we\nwere obliged to content ourselves with the single word, “Heathcliff.”\nThat came true: we were. If you enter the kirkyard, you’ll read, on his\nheadstone, only that, and the date of his death.\n\nDawn restored me to common sense. I rose, and went into the garden, as\nsoon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his\nwindow. There were none. “He has stayed at home,” I thought, “and he’ll\nbe all right to-day.” I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my\nusual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the\nmaster came down, for he lay late. They preferred taking it out of\ndoors, under the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.\n\nOn my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below. He and Joseph were\nconversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute\ndirections concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and\nturned his head continually aside, and had the same excited expression,\neven more exaggerated. When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in\nthe place he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him.\nHe drew it nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at\nthe opposite wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up\nand down, with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest\nthat he stopped breathing during half a minute together.\n\n“Come now,” I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, “eat and\ndrink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.”\n\nHe didn’t notice me, and yet he smiled. I’d rather have seen him gnash\nhis teeth than smile so.\n\n“Mr. Heathcliff! master!” I cried, “don’t, for God’s sake, stare as if\nyou saw an unearthly vision.”\n\n“Don’t, for God’s sake, shout so loud,” he replied. “Turn round, and\ntell me, are we by ourselves?”\n\n“Of course,” was my answer; “of course we are.”\n\nStill, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure. With a\nsweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the\nbreakfast things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.\n\nNow, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded\nhim alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two\nyards’ distance. And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both\npleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet\nraptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea. The\nfancied object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with\nunwearied diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned\naway. I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if\nhe stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he\nstretched his hand out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched\nbefore they reached it, and remained on the table, forgetful of their\naim.\n\nI sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention\nfrom its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up,\nasking why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his\nmeals? and saying that on the next occasion I needn’t wait: I might set\nthe things down and go. Having uttered these words he left the house,\nslowly sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the\ngate.\n\nThe hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. I did not retire to\nrest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep. He returned after\nmidnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room\nbeneath. I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and\ndescended. It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a\nhundred idle misgivings.\n\nI distinguished Mr. Heathcliff’s step, restlessly measuring the floor,\nand he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a\ngroan. He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was\nthe name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or\nsuffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and\nearnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul. I had not courage to\nwalk straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his\nreverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and\nbegan to scrape the cinders. It drew him forth sooner than I expected.\nHe opened the door immediately, and said—“Nelly, come here—is it\nmorning? Come in with your light.”\n\n“It is striking four,” I answered. “You want a candle to take upstairs:\nyou might have lit one at this fire.”\n\n“No, I don’t wish to go upstairs,” he said. “Come in, and kindle _me_ a\nfire, and do anything there is to do about the room.”\n\n“I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,” I replied,\ngetting a chair and the bellows.\n\nHe roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his\nheavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for\ncommon breathing between.\n\n“When day breaks I’ll send for Green,” he said; “I wish to make some\nlegal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters,\nand while I can act calmly. I have not written my will yet; and how to\nleave my property I cannot determine. I wish I could annihilate it from\nthe face of the earth.”\n\n“I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,” I interposed. “Let your will be\na while: you’ll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I\nnever expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at\npresent, marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own\nfault. The way you’ve passed these three last days might knock up a\nTitan. Do take some food, and some repose. You need only look at\nyourself in a glass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are\nhollow, and your eyes blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger\nand going blind with loss of sleep.”\n\n“It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,” he replied. “I assure\nyou it is through no settled designs. I’ll do both, as soon as I\npossibly can. But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water\nrest within arms’ length of the shore! I must reach it first, and then\nI’ll rest. Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my\ninjustices, I’ve done no injustice, and I repent of nothing. I’m too\nhappy; and yet I’m not happy enough. My soul’s bliss kills my body, but\ndoes not satisfy itself.”\n\n“Happy, master?” I cried. “Strange happiness! If you would hear me\nwithout being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you\nhappier.”\n\n“What is that?” he asked. “Give it.”\n\n“You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,” I said, “that from the time you were\nthirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and\nprobably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period. You\nmust have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have\nspace to search it now. Could it be hurtful to send for some one—some\nminister of any denomination, it does not matter which—to explain it,\nand show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how\nunfit you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before\nyou die?”\n\n“I’m rather obliged than angry, Nelly,” he said, “for you remind me of\nthe manner in which I desire to be buried. It is to be carried to the\nchurchyard in the evening. You and Hareton may, if you please,\naccompany me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys\nmy directions concerning the two coffins! No minister need come; nor\nneed anything be said over me.—I tell you I have nearly attained _my_\nheaven; and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.”\n\n“And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that\nmeans, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?” I\nsaid, shocked at his godless indifference. “How would you like it?”\n\n“They won’t do that,” he replied: “if they did, you must have me\nremoved secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically,\nthat the dead are not annihilated!”\n\nAs soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired\nto his den, and I breathed freer. But in the afternoon, while Joseph\nand Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and,\nwith a wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody\nwith him. I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and\nmanner frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be\nhis companion alone.\n\n“I believe you think me a fiend,” he said, with his dismal laugh:\n“something too horrible to live under a decent roof.” Then turning to\nCatherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he\nadded, half sneeringly,—“Will _you_ come, chuck? I’ll not hurt you. No!\nto you I’ve made myself worse than the devil. Well, there is _one_ who\nwon’t shrink from my company! By God! she’s relentless. Oh, damn it!\nIt’s unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear—even mine.”\n\nHe solicited the society of no one more. At dusk he went into his\nchamber. Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard\nhim groaning and murmuring to himself. Hareton was anxious to enter;\nbut I bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him. When\nhe came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found\nit locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned. He was better, and would be\nleft alone; so the doctor went away.\n\nThe following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till\nday-dawn; and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed\nthe master’s window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in. He\ncannot be in bed, I thought: those showers would drench him through. He\nmust either be up or out. But I’ll make no more ado, I’ll go boldly and\nlook.\n\nHaving succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to\nunclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them\naside, I peeped in. Mr. Heathcliff was there—laid on his back. His eyes\nmet mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile. I\ncould not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with\nrain; the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still. The lattice,\nflapping to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no\nblood trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I\ncould doubt no more: he was dead and stark!\n\nI hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I\ntried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful,\nlife-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. They would\nnot shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and\nsharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another fit of cowardice, I\ncried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but\nresolutely refused to meddle with him.\n\n“Th’ divil’s harried off his soul,” he cried, “and he may hev’ his\ncarcass into t’ bargin, for aught I care! Ech! what a wicked ’un he\nlooks, girning at death!” and the old sinner grinned in mockery. I\nthought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly\ncomposing himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and\nreturned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were\nrestored to their rights.\n\nI felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred\nto former times with a sort of oppressive sadness. But poor Hareton,\nthe most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much. He sat by\nthe corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest. He pressed its hand,\nand kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from\ncontemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs\nnaturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.\n\nMr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master\ndied. I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four\ndays, fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he\ndid not abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange\nillness, not the cause.\n\nWe buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished.\nEarnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin,\ncomprehended the whole attendance. The six men departed when they had\nlet it down into the grave: we stayed to see it covered. Hareton, with\na streaming face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould\nhimself: at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion\nmounds—and I hope its tenant sleeps as soundly. But the country folks,\nif you ask them, would swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are\nthose who speak to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and\neven within this house. Idle tales, you’ll say, and so say I. Yet that\nold man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on ’em looking out\nof his chamber window on every rainy night since his death:—and an odd\nthing happened to me about a month ago. I was going to the Grange one\nevening—a dark evening, threatening thunder—and, just at the turn of\nthe Heights, I encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs\nbefore him; he was crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were\nskittish, and would not be guided.\n\n“What is the matter, my little man?” I asked.\n\n“There’s Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t’ nab,” he blubbered,\n“un’ I darnut pass ’em.”\n\nI saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on, so I bid him\ntake the road lower down. He probably raised the phantoms from\nthinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard\nhis parents and companions repeat. Yet, still, I don’t like being out\nin the dark now; and I don’t like being left by myself in this grim\nhouse: I cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift\nto the Grange.\n\n“They are going to the Grange, then?” I said.\n\n“Yes,” answered Mrs. Dean, “as soon as they are married, and that will\nbe on New Year’s Day.”\n\n“And who will live here then?”\n\n“Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep\nhim company. They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut\nup.”\n\n“For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?” I observed.\n\n“No, Mr. Lockwood,” said Nelly, shaking her head. “I believe the dead\nare at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.”\n\nAt that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.\n\n“_They_ are afraid of nothing,” I grumbled, watching their approach\nthrough the window. “Together, they would brave Satan and all his\nlegions.”\n\nAs they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look\nat the moon—or, more correctly, at each other by her light—I felt\nirresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance\ninto the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my\nrudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door;\nand so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his\nfellow-servant’s gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised\nme for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his\nfeet.\n\nMy walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the\nkirk. When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even\nin seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and\nslates jutted off, here and there, beyond the right line of the roof,\nto be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.\n\nI sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next\nthe moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in heath; Edgar Linton’s\nonly harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff’s\nstill bare.\n\nI lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths\nfluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind\nbreathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever\nimagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.", "chapters": [{"title": "CHAPTER I", "startIndex": 5}, {"title": "CHAPTER II", "startIndex": 1920}, {"title": "CHAPTER III", "startIndex": 5254}, {"title": "CHAPTER IV", "startIndex": 10060}, {"title": "CHAPTER V", "startIndex": 12753}, {"title": "CHAPTER VI", "startIndex": 14157}, {"title": "CHAPTER VII", "startIndex": 16725}, {"title": "CHAPTER VIII", "startIndex": 20730}, {"title": "CHAPTER IX", "startIndex": 24124}, {"title": "CHAPTER X", "startIndex": 30191}, {"title": "CHAPTER XI", "startIndex": 36497}, {"title": "CHAPTER XII", "startIndex": 40569}, {"title": "CHAPTER XIII", "startIndex": 45496}, {"title": "CHAPTER XIV", "startIndex": 49743}, {"title": "CHAPTER XV", "startIndex": 53102}, {"title": "CHAPTER XVI", "startIndex": 56245}, {"title": "CHAPTER XVII", "startIndex": 57999}, {"title": "CHAPTER XVIII", "startIndex": 64808}, {"title": "CHAPTER XIX", "startIndex": 68387}, {"title": "CHAPTER XX", "startIndex": 69982}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXI", "startIndex": 72144}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXII", "startIndex": 78488}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXIII", "startIndex": 80826}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXIV", "startIndex": 83709}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXV", "startIndex": 87600}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXVI", "startIndex": 89021}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXVII", "startIndex": 90495}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXVIII", "startIndex": 94999}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXIX", "startIndex": 97620}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXX", "startIndex": 99894}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXXI", "startIndex": 102280}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXXII", "startIndex": 104367}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXXIII", "startIndex": 108435}, {"title": "CHAPTER XXXIV", "startIndex": 111570}]}
